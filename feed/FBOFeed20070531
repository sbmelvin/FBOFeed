<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID)in Atlanta, GA intends to negotiate with Fluoresentric, Inc. in Park City, UT.   NCID is validating a proprietary real-time PCR assay which was developed by Fluoresentric (Park City, UT) that is capable of detecting the genes for botulinum toxin types A through G using the Lightcycler platform with Taqman chemistry.  These assays will be utilized by laboratories responding to intentional or unintentional outbreaks of botulism.  
Single target assays (singleplex) will be available for each of the seven toxin types A through G.  We require that type A, B, E, and F assays will be provided as follows: i) 7000 reactions of each type be provided as 200 lyophilized reactions per tube and ii) 3000 reactions of each type be provided as 100 lyophilized reactions per tube.  For types C, D, and G assays we require that all 1000 reactions be provided as 100 lyophilized reactions per tube.
Assays will be required to have a sensitivity of less than or equal to 10 copies. Assay sensitivity will be determined using dilutions of a known quantity of a synthetic template whose sequence is identical to that of the amplicon.  Assays will be required to have no cross-reactivity to other Clostridia spp., between botulinum toxin types, or among enteric bacterial pathogens.  Finally, the lyophilized product must have a shelf life equal to or greater than 6 months when stored at 4oC.  
Fluoresentric will provide technical support by telephone and/or internet.  In addition, Fluoresentric will provide the oligonucleotide sequence information in order to permit CDC to reconstitute the assay, if necessary.  
The vendor will provide quality control results to CDC for each lot of assays delivered to confirm that the reactions perform as stated above.   CDC will test each lot of the finished goods to confirm that the assays conform to the specifications described above.
In order to ensure that the assays specifications are met, it is critical that the assay design be identical among lots.  Therefore, the assay must contain the identical oligonucleotide sequences, PCR conditions, specificity, and sensitivity as that developed by Fluoresentric.

Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give a written capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this presolicitation notice.  A determination not to compete thisproposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a Federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.  Please address all inquiries to Denise Rains (509)354-8111, (509)354-8099 fax or email DGR8@CDC.GOV.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized.

<DESC>Market Survey Request for  Sources Information Be-300 KING AIR AIRCRAFT Refurbish interior of Aircraft General Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aviation System Standards (AVN) is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for SEDB or Small Business or open it up for full and open competition.  The NAICS CODE for this requirement is 33641 Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing --Size Standard 1,500 personnel.  This requirement is for Refurbishing the interior of the aircraft to a Statement of Work.  The FAA currently has 18 Be-300 King Air aircraft that will require Refurbishing.  The FAA is looking for vendors with capabilities and that also meet airfield runway minimum requirements.  In addition, a transportation evaluation factor will be included in any SIR issued for this requirement based on the distance being determined by nautical miles between FAA, Oklahoma City, to the vendors maintenance site and back for 18 aircraft, plus cost of inspection by FAA inspection personnel making the same trip.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey by returning a completed Attachment A to this document.  The FAA aircraft may or may not be available on a regular schedule due to Flight Inspection Requirements.  The FAA estimates there may be up to 30 to 60 days per year when the aircraft will not be available to the vendor to start work.  Once the aircraft has been delivered to the vendor, the vendor will have 60 to 90 calendar days (to be determined) to complete ing of the aircraft.  Attached to this announcement is a draft specification for Refurbishing, note that the actual Refurbishment SOW is in process and will be provided with the SIR when it is formally issued.

Please note that documents downloaded from sites other than the FAA's Contracting Opportunities Homepage may not be the latest documents, all FAA SIR amendments will also be shown on this site as Amendment when required.  Vendors must follow this site daily to determine if additional SIR amendments have been issued.  Only offers that provide information packages providing the required certifications and information demonstrating that their site and facilities meeting the minimum site conditions will be added to the source list.  The minimum requirements will remain the same for the issued SIR as contained in ATTACHMENT A.   All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with the Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.

The Attachment A includes a list of minimums that a vendor must meet to be considered an acceptable source, for example--Length of runway.  The aircraft requires a minimum number of feet of runway for take off and landing - sites that do not meet this minimum will be determined to be unacceptable and removed from further consideration for award.  The vendor will be required to provide documentation/information on the airfield and runways length with their response to the market survey in support of information provided with the ATTACHMENT A completed, with documentation that follows that clearly demonstrates that the required minimum is met or exceeded.   The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address:  Please submit in a portable document format (pdf); however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.

<DESC>This is a notice of intention to issue a solicitation for SPARES to obtain a firm fixed price contract for the ALR-56 A & C system.  

Noun: Electron Tube; NSN: 5960-00-477-5895EW; P/N: 226523-000, 

The solicitation shall consist of First Article Quantity: 1 ea , Production Quantity: 2 ea,   MEQ (Mission Essential quantity) for:  21 ea  

Option I qty ranges from 1-38 ea (1-13, 14-26, 27-38), Option II qty ranges from 1-43 ea (1-15, 16-30, 31-43)

First Article due within 225 calendar days from date of contract.

This requirement will be solicited in a FULL and OPEN competitive environment. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  

See notes 8, 22, 26 @  http://www.fbo.gov/Numbered_Notes.html

Synopsis Note ?D? applies ?Insurance Buy? and synopsis Note ?F? applies ?Export Control Data?

https://pkec.robins.af.mil/wrlcnts.htm


This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 Award of Mission Essential Quantity
AWARD OF MISSION ESSENTIAL QUANTITY (AFMC) (AUG 1998)
(a) The Government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units? mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award the Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ) and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives. 
(b) The Government shall first determine the apparent successful offeror for the complete quantity under Alternative 1. If offers are received from both proven and unproven sources and it is determined that an unproven source is the apparent low offeror (and is also responsive and responsible), then the prices under Alternative 2 shall be evaluated. Once a decision has been made to progress to Alternative 2, offers under Alternative 1 shall no longer be considered (e.g. the Contracting Officer shall not compare the proven source?s offer under Alternative 1 and the unproven source?s offer under Alternative 2). If only unproven sources submit offers, Alternative 1 will be used to determine the low offeror and award will be made for that quantity. 
(c) A proven source is an offeror who has previously satisfactorily provided the identical item to the Government or who proposes to provide an item manufactured by the prime manufacturer or the prime manufacturer?s vendor (when there is no value added by the prime manufacturer). 
(d) An unproven source is an offeror who has not previously satisfactorily provided the identical item to the Government and who proposes to provide an item manufactured by other than the prime manufacturer or the prime manufacturer?s vendor (when there is no value added by the prime manufacturer). 
(e) Competitive negotiated acquisition procedures may be used to determine low offeror status if, 
(1) a proven source is not the low offeror, based on either initial proposals or on the final proposal revision if discussions are conducted, and 
(2) if the proven source?s price is not determined to be based on adequate price competition pursuant to FAR 15.403-1, Prohibition on obtaining cost or pricing data. 
The contracting officer may proceed with an award to the low unproven source and may request cost or pricing data from the proven source. When received and evaluated, negotiations shall follow as necessary to determine fair and reasonable prices. Under these circumstances, any contract with the proven source would contain the clause at FAR 52.215-10, Price Reduction For Defective Cost or Pricing Data. 
(f) The Government is under no obligation to exercise any options provided for under these procedures. Acceptable delivery of the basic award quantity by an unproven source shall not bind the Government to exercise all or part of the option quantities, or to exercise options in any contract with the unproven source in lieu of options in any separate award to a proven source. In addition, the Government reserves the right to reject, as nonresponsive, any offer in which the prices proposed in either Alternative 1 or 2 are determined, by the Contracting Officer, to be materially unbalanced.

Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423490.  The reference number for this Request for Quote (RFQ) is HM157507T0007.   NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13.  The requirement is for the following items:

1) Body Armor - Medium in Size: Quantity: 85 each

2) Body Armor - Large in Size: Quantity: 10 each

Delivery: 30 days after award

The Specifications must be met: 

General Quality Requirements:  All materials are to be clean, brand new and free of any defects.  All workmanship is to be of first quality.  The Agency shall have the sole right to determine if this and all other requirements have been met.
Origin of Manufacture:  Only vest assembled entirely by United States citizens or persons who have legally immigrated and/or applied for United States citizenship will be considered for purchase.
Design Requirements: Concealable soft body armor intended for primary use as an undergarment worn concealed by a uniform or other type of shirt. This ballistic vest shall consist of two primary components- the ballistic panels enclosed by a protective Ballistic Panel cover and the Ballistic Vest Carrier or "outer-shell".
General Design and User Coverage. The soft body armor must provide maximum practical coverage for male and female officers for everyday wear.  However it must not bind or restrict user mobility or wearability.  The intent is provide full wrap, or overlap protection of the torso-coverage is to the maximum available consistent with wearability needs.  The soft body armor is defined as a vest with "full wrap" side panels that provide "overlap" protection. Suitable relief of not more than 1 inch should be allowed between the bottom edge of the vest and the gun belt when standing so that no binding occurs when the Officer is in the sitting position.  Ample relief must be provided in the armpit region for maximum mobility and a 2" or 3" scoop neck must be provided to maintain concealability and prevent the armor from showing when worn under a shirt with an open collar.
Ballistic Panels: The back and front armor panels should be one piece units made of Twaron/LFT Protexa and foam weave armor. The armor must meet or exceed National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 2005 Interim standards and preferably have MilSpec certification for Threat Level II protection from multiple hits and must have concurrent V-50 Ballistic Limit "benchmark" testing with the NIJ 2005 Interim testing and proof of certification and test reports must be submitted with this bid.

Level II Lbs/ft2(0.83)  Thinness(.29 inches)  V-50 9mm(1540) 
V-50 .357 (1562)  Backface 9mm(23.5) Backface .357 (32.38)
 	
Ballistic Panel Covers The armor must be contained in a heat sealed high elastic hydrolysis/microbial resistant polyurethane outer membrane such as VisiBALLISTICS(patent pending)that is opaque on one side and clear on the other. The membrane must be aromatic polyether polyurethane film/sheets with high crystallinity that facilitate bonding to substrates with water based adhesives.  Additional properties are functional flame retardant, high moisture vapor transfer rate and functional static dissipation.  This will provide the ballistic armor with added protection from moisture and odor while permitting a "Self Check" visual inspection system.  The ballistic covering (membrane) must be sealed by ultrasonic welding to prevent moisture penetration of the armor fibers.  The sonic seaming must hold fabric together as such tensile strength of seal is greater than the components on their own.  You must not be able to pull seam or weld apart once the materials are sonically sealed or welded. The membrane must have Velcro tabs that can attach to the inside of the inner face of the carrier for stability of the armor panels must be contained There must be an additional soft trauma plate which also meets or exceeds NIJ standards and having concurrent V-50 "benchmark" testing to fit in the carrier front as described below. Included in bid material, minimum testing must be conducted and written verification sent in of below testing.
 
Specific Gravity: ASTM Test Method (D-792)and Value (1.12)

Ballistic Panel Concealed Label:  Each ballistic vest must also contain a concealed label to enable future tracing of the panel by model, serial and lot number, and date of manufacture.
Ballistic Vest Carrier:  two black in color VERTEX multi adjustable carriers will be issued with each vest. Each carrier must have two stealth plate pockets so that the wearer has the option of using either a standard 5x8 inch (13cmx20cm) or an optional 7x10 inch (18cmx25cm) armor plate. Materials used in the construction of the carriers? inner face must be a knit mesh with moisture management, anti-odor, microbial properties on the body side and have Velcro tabs to hold the upper (shoulder) wings of the armor in place and contribute to the stability of the armor in the carrier.

All carriers must come with attached shirttails; have zippered access slots for the removal and insertion of the armor panels, not Velcro, except for the torso trauma plate pouch which should be Velcro sealed. 
Product Consistency: The manufacturer must warrant that all shipments of each certified model will be identical in design and construction to that which was originally certified.  The manufacturer and NIJ must have retained samples from the original certification for verification and/or inspection.  No substitutions will be allowed without prior approval of both the Agency and the End User Action Officers.
Serialization: All vests must be serialized, 100% inspected and traceable. All procedures and quality data must be available to the Agency for inspection upon request.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Headquarters Acquisition Directorate intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the design, construction and delivery of a Fast Response Cutter B Class (FRC-B), with options for the construction and delivery of up to 57 more. The RFP is expected to be released on or about 22 June 2007 via the Federal Business Opportunity (FEDBIZOPPS) web page at www.fbo.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation and specification will not be issued. It is incumbent upon offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS web page for RFP release and all subsequent amendments. The standard industrial classification code is 3732 and the NAICS is 336612. The Coast Guard intends to conduct a full and open competition, with award being made on a best value basis.  Please direct all inquiries to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at Henrietta.K.Brisbon@uscg.mil.  For the information of Industry, the following preliminary details are provided:  


Mission Sets.  The following are mission sets that the FRC-B will be required to accomplish: Search and Rescue, General Law Enforcement, Drug Interdiction, Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations, Living Marine Resource Enforcement, Maritime Homeland Security/Defense, Defense Readiness Operations, Port Operations Security and Defense.  

In-Service Parent Craft Requirement.  The FRC-B design shall be based on an in-service parent craft meeting the following definition:

In-Service: The Parent Craft shall have been previously designed, built, and operated as a patrol craft in unrestricted service.  Craft originally designed and built for other service, which have been successfully modified for patrol service, and have operated successfully in patrol service, are acceptable.  Craft designed and built for other than patrol service, but as yet unproven in patrol service are not acceptable.  Patrol service shall mean (1) the craft incorporates accommodations, armament, electronics, and communications equipment similar to existing Coast Guard patrol cutters and/or the FRC-B COR; and (2) that the craft has operated in search and rescue, enforcement of laws and treaties, and/or military service.  A minimum of two such craft shall have been designed and built and one of these craft shall be designated the Parent Craft.  The Parent Craft shall have operated in offshore patrol service for a minimum of two years.  As an alternative, if only a single such craft proposed as a Parent Craft exists, it shall have operated in offshore patrol service for a minimum of six years.

The following shall be identical to the Parent Craft: a) Hull form and dimensions (defined as the underwater body and hull up to the sheer line of the Parent Craft); b) Underwater appendages type and configuration (i.e. Rudder position, shaft line, etc.); c) Type of propulsion (i.e. Diesel driven, Fixed pitch propeller, Controllable pitch propeller, Marine Water Jet, etc.); and d) Arrangement and configuration of the propulsion system (i.e., two engine, three engine, shaft angle, etc.).

Structural changes that do not vary the hull form will be allowed in order to meet the requirements for vessel classification, substitutions in the propulsion system, and the cutter boat launch and recovery system.  Examples of these changes include moving watertight bulkheads or providing an equivalent or higher strength hull material. 

The FRC-B full load displacement shall not vary by more than 10% from the Parent Craft full load displacement.  The FRC-B longitudinal center of gravity (LCG) at full load displacement shall not vary by more than 1% of the length on the waterline from the Parent Craft LCG at full load.

Principle Operating/Design Characteristics.  The principle characteristics of the FRC-B are: 120 ft - 160 ft overall length, 10 ft maximum draft, 28 knot minimum flank speed, independent operations for 5 days, crew size of 22, and the ability to safely launch and recover the cutter boat through sea state 4.  The RFP includes providing electronic navigation, communications, and surveillance systems.  The delivery schedule requires the lead cutter to be delivered 730 days after contract award.

Vessel Classification.  The American Bureau of Shipping, Guide for Building and Classing High Speed Naval Craft, 2007 (ABS HSNC Guide) shall be used in the design, construction, and classing of the vessel.  The FRC-B shall be classed as (Maltese Cross) A1, Circle E, HSC Naval Craft, (Maltese Cross) AMS, (Maltese Cross) ABCU SFA(35).

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control     activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design    capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified     source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The       approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical     data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or      knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate      source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification  procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having        jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight        critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time required  for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed    pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must     submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the             "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia   Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical data    required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your   offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source         approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source  Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the    Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this             solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted  hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the  ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award   of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Nixon Power Services: 1.	 The 12V71 Detroit Diesel Engine is locked up and will not turn over.  The program schedule did not anticipate the engine operation to cause a delay therefore placing the repairs on a critical path.   The engine is a specialized piece of equipment.  The 12V71 engine is a 2 cycle engine and is not manufactured any more.  The newer engines are 4 cycle.  Only a certified Detroit Diesel Mechanic (2 cycle) should work on this unit.  Nixon Power Services is the company that originally built and configured the unit for NASA and installed the unit back in the 1980s.  Nixon provides a certified Detroit Diesel mechanic (2 cycle) and will support the test schedule in a timely manner.  2.    Searching for multiple certified repair centers and bidding process for the repair of the Detroit Diesel Engine will seriously impact the Test programs schedule.	Nixon Power Services can provide the repair that will minimize impact to test program schedule. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. Central Standard time on 06/05/2007.

<SUBJECT>R--Support for Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Programs and Activities
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-07-10464
<CONTACT>ANGELA M. SCHOPLER, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2036, E-Mail: schopler.angela@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) requires a contactor to provide technical support for services that will support EPA's implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  The SDWA envisions a joint federal/state partnership to protect public health through safe drinking water.  The Act as amended in 1996 further envisions a multiple barrier approach to public health protection including protection of source waters from contamination; treatment at the water plant and management of the distribution system to ensure compliance with nationally-promulgated standards; and efforts to inform customers of public water systems about local drinking water quality. Since 2001, EPA's responsibilities have been extended to address the security of the nation's critical water and wastewater infrastructure from terrorist and other intentional acts, in accordance with the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act) and Homeland Security Presidential Directives. The SDWA requires EPA to evaluate unregulated contaminants as well as to periodically review existing regulations.  EPA oversees implementation of the Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) and Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs by states and tribes with primary enforcement authority and directly implements these programs in the absence of state or tribal enforcement authority.   In addition to assisting states and water systems in meeting regulatory requirements, EPA carries out an array of related activities including promotion of source water protection; oversight of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF); characterization of public water system needs; data management and verification audits; development of tools and analyses to support program accountability; analytical methods development; Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modeling promotion of  approaches for sustainable infrastructure; support for consumer confidence and public notice requirements; support for sanitary surveys; and development of products such as guidance, training and tools to strengthen small water systems' capacity development efforts and support the use of certified operators.  EPA may promulgate regulations under the UIC program and is also engaged in addressing emerging underground injection issues such as carbon sequestration and disposal of drinking water treatment residuals. The contractor will provide technical, analytical, administrative, engineering and statistical support to the Agency's efforts to develop and implement regulations, guidance and policies across this full range of SDWA implementation activities. This includes activities such as collecting data, information and materials and providing factual studies, trend analyses and recommendations; conducting modeling and assessments to support risk characterization and impact analyses development and survey support and facilitation.  The contractor shall provide such support in accordance with specific written work assignments related to the Agency's development of drinking water, ground water, and UIC regulations, future regulatory and programmatic decisions, and implementation of its policies and programs under the SDWA.  Responsible offerors shall demonstrate an ability to provide the level of effort, material, equipment, and facilities necessary to provide timely, professional engineering, technical and administrative services necessary to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrences to characterize drinking water threats. The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water.  This will be a performance based acquisition including a performance work statement and quality assurance surveillance plan.  The anticipated contract type level-of-effort, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract consisting of a base period performance of twelve months, followed by three (3) optional performance periods of 12 months each and (3) award term options for a total potential performance period of seven (7) years. The base period will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours.  Option period one will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. Option period two will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours.  Option period three will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. Award Term Option period four will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours.  Award Term Option period five will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. Award Term Option period six will consist of a maximum amount of 27,300 professional direct labor hours, with 18,200 base direct professional labor hours plus 9,100 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. There will be a maximum potential combined total of 191,100 direct labor professional hours, base and all optional quantities, over the potential seven (7) year life of the contract. The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) requiring an offeror to certify that it is unaware of any potential Conflict of Interest or to disclose any potential Conflict of Interest of which it is aware will be a part of the solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential Conflict of Interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. In addition, the contractor shall be subject to the clause LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (EPAAR 1552.209-74), which may limit the contractor's eligibility to perform work as a prime Contractor or subcontractor under an ensuing EPA contract.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

This request for information is set-aside for Mississippi and Louisiana firms only in accordance with the Stafford Act as amended.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used a proposal.  This notice is issued for the following purpose:

Due to the large quantity of FEMA temporary housing units being recovered from Mississippi and Louisiana Hurricane Katrina victims, FEMA is seeking a contractor to manage an operation to begin the staging and disposal of deactivated travel trailers (TTs) and mobile homes (MHs) from Mississippi and Louisiana within 10 days of award of a contract.

The proposed site should be 250-500 acres of fenced hard stand capable of handling the movement of MHs and travel trailers with heavy equipment and other means of movement, to include pickup trucks, forklifts, and farm tractors. The storage capacity in an operational (herringbone) configuration of TTs is 70 units per acre and 25 MHs per acre.  The equipment will be provided by the contractor to move travel trailers and mobile homes within the site.  The site will require a ?check-in/check out? area where trailers will be processed into and out of the site.  The contractor will be required to receive, process, and park up to approximately 500 units per day in a combination of deactivations and movements from other staging areas.  Adequate work space/facilities are to be provided to accommodate personnel working in this area.  Office equipment, such as high speed copiers, computers, printers, etc., are also to be provided by the contractor. 
 
This facility will also support a GSA Utilization & Donations and Sales program office facilities and other staff involved in the selling of mobile homes and travel trailers.  The contractor will be required to prepare, and set up travel trailer and mobile home sales areas that will accommodate up to 400 units in 4 sales lots.  Documentation preparation, contacts with the EHU Sales Office, and coordination on all sales will be the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor will be responsible to manage a sale of at least 100 units per week.  

To support the GSA Utilization & Donation and Sales programs the facility must be accessible to the public for viewing and removal of excess mobile home and travel trailer units. There must be adequate parking and working restroom facilities available for the employees and potential buyers of the excess units.  

The contractor will therefore supply the facilities, security, lighting, utilities, asset management, and communication capabilities and support to the GSA sales program.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women?s Health (OWH) has a requirement to expand a multidisciplinary approach to consumer health education to additional diverse audiences in the Philadelphia area.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Drexel University?s Women?s Health Education Program, Philadelphia, PA 19129 to address health disparities among African Americans by evaluating a community focused women?s health education workshop series on various topics and assessing the likelihood of perception for behavior change.

This acquisition shall be awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures and has been justified in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  Drexel University?s Women?s Health Education Program (WHEP) has a long history and commitment to investigating and developing educational remedies for clinicians to address women?s health disparities.  The WHEP is a program of the Drexel University College of Medicine?s Department of Medicine that strives to improve the health of women by promoting girls? and women?s health issues in the medical curriculum, thus spearheading innovations in medical education, and translating women?s health education into community programming. The Women?s Health Education Program has extensive experience in health disparities issues for women and has conducted numerous outreach programs educating about barriers to care, beliefs about the health care system, communication skills, risk perception of disease and health advocacy. Since Drexel has pioneered this project, they are justifiably the only ones in the Philadelphia area who can complete the efficacy of the project. In addition, WHEP has experience in promoting changes in the medical curriculum by evaluating a community-focused Women?s Health Education Workshop Series on various topics and assessing the likelihood of perception for behavior change to address health disparities among African Americans in Philadelphia. The Drexel University has piloted this project with two previous workshops.  This multidisciplinary approach is still in the developmental stage and being targeted in the Philadelphia area before it can be generalized to other cities.  


Interested concerns capable of providing the services identified in the paragraphs above may submit a capability statement with documentation supporting its ability to meet the above requirements. No solicitation is available at this time.  Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Following evaluation of capability statements, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer shall proceed with award to Drexel University.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of the Director (OD), Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. James Robb, Boca Raton, FL  33428 to provide recommendation and guidance on technical pathology expertise on OBBR initiatives for the harmonization of biospecimen handling practice.   

The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 2 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.  

The growing technical capability of genomic/proteomic analytical tools has increased the power and potential of medical research, ushered in the era of molecular medicine, and accelerated the drive toward personalized medicine.  Collections of high-quality, clinically annotated biospecimens have become a critical resources for the acceleration and enhancement of cancer research, and the critical need for improvement in this area is widely acknowledged throughout the scientific community and related constituencies.  In the fall of 2005 the NCI establish the Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR) to guide, coordinate, and develop the Institute?s resources and capabilities in these areas.
The OBBR  has established four major strategic priorities as follows:  1) develop and foster state-of-the-science methods to assess, improve, and ensure the quality of biorepositories funded by the NCI;  2) sponsor and/or collaborate on large-scale NCI projects in which the principles of high-quality shared biospecimen resources are critical for achieving the research goals;  3) collaborate with other major initiatives outside the NCI to achieve global improvement in processes for biospecimen consent, handling, storage, and information management; and 4) develop educational tools and resources for all potential stakeholders (public, professional, private) that address the spectrum of issues related to human biospecimens in order to align interested constituencies on the importance of high-quality shared biospecimen resources. 
Contractor requirements: 1) the establishment of a process for developing sets of best practice documents  with the collaboration of a pathology laboratory practice accrediting body ; 2) pathology expertise to provide recommendation and guidance in the further development of the Biospecimen Research Network (BRN), particularly in identifying and prioritizing studies of analytical variables and in the further development of the BRN web based biospecimen research database and search engine; 3) expert pathologist evaluation of selected sites for the pilot project of the NCI Community Cancer Centers with the application of developed best practices at participating sites.   

To perform this work a contractor must meet the following minimum qualifications:   The contractor must be a board certified pathologist with at least 10 years? experience as a clinician and at senior-level medical administrative positions.  Over the last five years, the contractor must have participated in laboratory accreditation, biospecimen handling procedures standardization, and medical informatics systems integration initiatives.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months upon date of award with one six month option period if exercised.

	Dr. James Robb is unique in his field because of his particular combination of skills and experience.  These skills and experience include:  1)  Board-certified pathologist with 40 years of clinical experience;  2)  Tenured full professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego;  3)  Director of Cytopathology and Molecular Pathology at Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA and Cedars Medical Center, Miami, FL;  Dr. Robb developed novel immunohistochemial techniques for human cancer differential diagnosis within the context of a large clinical practice;  4)  Medical Director of Integrated Regional Laboratories, which includes 13 hospitals with 13 independent medical staffs and medical committees, highly automated free-standing core laboratory, 950 employees, 8 million clinical lab tests/year, 3000 physicians, 4000 inpatients, 50 pathologists in 13 independent pathology group practices, >20 nursing homes, multistate jail system, physician offices, and Caribbean Island/Belez patients/physicians;  5)  In terms of particular IT experience, Dr. Robb established connectivity between Florida clinical laboratory to Florida Department of Health using the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) and was a Member of SNOMED International Editorial Board and Authority; and 5)  Membership on the College of American Pathologists? Board of Governors and Council of Scientific Affairs

Dr. Robb?s particular combination of skills and experience is quite unusual for someone of his education and training profile.  OBBR is not aware of any other pathologist with a career that spans all the critical areas that the OBBR is trying to address in its goal of harmonization and standardization of specimen handling and in conducting novel research into the effects of particular handling variables on the outcomes of post-genomic analysis.  The critical biospecimen-related areas that Dr. Robb?s professional experience address are:  1)   clinical ? Dr. Robb has held senior executive level management positions in large-scale medical practices;  2)  academic cancer research - Dr. Robb has published research in the area of molecular oncogenesis, is on the editorial board of Cancer Cytopathology, and is an ad-hoc reviewer for several medical journals;  3)  accreditation and governance -  Dr. Robb is a Governor of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and on several other CAP administrative and scientific affairs committees, including Laboratory Accreditation; AND  4)  innovation ? Dr. Robb has been involved in standardization of clinical laboratory testing procedures and informatics systems integration and standardization of medical reporting nomenclature for pathology.  Dr. Robb is a member of the CMS Technical Expert Panel for the Clinical Lab Services Demo Project; a member of the Healthcare IT Standards Panel and Biosurveillance Standards Technical Committee.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercis ing an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12 month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period contract amount.  At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capaci ty is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order aw ards will be made as follows:  (1) All awardees will b e given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500.

The certification software could cost approximately $110 - $125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.  Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site:  http://www.cpars.navy.mil/.  If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CCASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.

(2) If any subcontractor identified in the proposal changes the amount of lower-tier subcontractor effort such that it exceeds 70 percent of the total of the work to be performed under its subcontract, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with a description of the value added by the subcontractor as related to the work to be performed by the lower-tier subcontractor(s). (3) If any subcontractor not identified in the proposal subcontracts to a lower-tier subcontractor more that 70 percent of the total cost of work to be performed under its subcontract, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with a description of the value added by the subcontractor as related to the work to be performed by the lower-tier subcontractor(s).

	(d) Recovery of excessive pass-through charges. If the Contracting Officer determines that excessive pass-through charges exist- (1) For fixed-price contracts, the Government shall be entitled to a price reduction for the amount of excessive pass-through charges included in the contract price; and (2) for other than fixed-price contracts, the excessive pass-through charges are unallowable in accordance with the provisions in subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Subpart 231.2 of the Defense FAR Supplement. 

	(e) Access to records. (1) The Contracting Officer, or authorized representative, shall have the right to examine and audit all the Contractor?s records (as defined at FAR 52.215-2(a)) necessary to determine whether the Contractor proposed, billed, or claimed excessive pass-through charges.

	(f) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), in all subcontracts under this contract, except for- (1) Firm-fixed-price subcontracts awarded on the basis of adequate price competition; (2) Fixed-priced subcontracts with economic price adjustment, awarded on the basis of adequate price competition;  (3) Firm-fixed-price subcontracts for the acquisition of a commercial item; or (4) Fixed-price subcontracts with economic price adjustment, for the acquisition of a commercial item.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO DELETE IN ITS ENTIRETY, THE PREVIOUS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND REPLACE IT WITH THE FOLLOWING:

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) anticipates pursuing the initial acquisition of one hundred thousand (100,000) treatment courses of a medical countermeasure for neutropenia arising as a consequence of acute radiation exposure (acute radiation syndrome, ARS).  It is anticipated the product will be licensed/approved for ARS use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and will be stable for at least 24 months.  There will be options for up to an additional one hundred thousand (100,000) treatment courses to meet the USG requirement of at least 200,000 treatment courses.  Potential respondents to this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) shall meet the following specific criteria:

1.  An active FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) application, for any indication, filed and not currently on clinical hold, for the suggested product.  Inclusion of the products Phase 1 and 2 clinical safety data, if completed, is desirable; this may represent safety data from a product already licensed for another indication.

2.  The company shall demonstrate validated bulk drug substance (BDS) production for the suggested product and demonstrate manufacturing capability at the proposed commercial scale.

3.  The respondent shall provide efficacy data for the product in appropriate animal models, with the goal of increased survival and improvement of peripheral circulating neutrophil counts, following administration of the product no earlier than 24 hours after whole body irradiation challenges in models sufficient to demonstrate lethality.  Data sufficient to demonstrate a radiation dose modification factor is desirable.

It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced in August 2007, with proposals due in November 2007.  At that time, the offeror(s) shall have integrated into product development plans FDAs current thinking describing the minimum product information and data that shall be submitted to the FDA for review in order to potentially consider use of the product to treat ARS-induced neutropenia in a declared emergency under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Respondents to this SSN may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement including an anticipated product delivery schedule and contact information for the primary contact at the organization (name, email, address, and telephone number) handling this SSN in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.   Responses are limited to 10 pages.  Data sets (e.g., tables, charts, graphs) and documents that are pertinent to the response can be submitted as appendices to the primary submission.  Potential respondents are also requested to include whether or not they are a large or small business.  All respondents and comments to this announcement shall reference DHHS-Sources Sought-ARS-May 2007 and be submitted to Linda Luczak, Contracting Officer, at Linda.Luczak@hhs.gov by COB on June 29, 2007.

<DESC>Additional Information: Current Contractor:  McDonnell Douglas Corporation - A Wholly Owned  Subsidiary of the Boeing Company in St Louis MO Current Contract Number: F41608-96-D-0700 Current Contract Expires on 30 Sep 2008 TITLE:  T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program CLS Sustainment Description:  1.  337th Aeronautical System Group (337 AESG), 663d  Aeronautical Systems Squadron (663 AESS) is contemplating a competitively  awarded contract for sustainment of the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program  (AUP).  This Request for Information is intended to provide the Air Force  with an understanding of the interest within industry, the technology, and  resources available to support competitive acquisition of a contract to  cover contractor logistics support (CLS) sustainment of the avionics  suites of 450 AETC, 3 AFMC and 10 Navy T-38C AUP aircraft.  The T-38C AUP  avionics suite consists of approximately 60 non-developmental (NDI) and  commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The CLS contract will be a  firm-fixed price, performance based service contract for the logistics  support and sustainment of the T-38C AUP consisting of a base year (FY09)  and with four additional years of FFP options.  The contract will provide  for: a)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETCs T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB and supporting operations  for Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); b)	A CLS program to repair removed components at the contractors (or  Original Equipment Manufacturers) facilities and return to COMBS, based  upon a fixed price for each of the annual number of hours flown by AETC,  AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 110,000 hours total  annually); c)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; d)	Materials for the O & A corrections; e)	Technical data and technical manuals, recommendations to responsible  engineering organization; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC Main Operating Bases,  Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS; g)	An effective Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages  Management (DMSMS) program; h)	A system that collects, manages and archives Maintenance Fault Lists  (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL)/engine,  flight loads and ACMI data for each  flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis  and could lead to product improvement; i)	A damaged equipment program; j)	In coordination with organization having systems engineering  responsibility resolve any issues involving software support, engineering  services and material deficiency reporting; k)	and the program management necessary to support these activities. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. 2.  The T-38C CLS Sustainment approach will include performance based  logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at the avionics  level, and at the LRU level (system level avionics MTBF of 60 hours).  Guaranteed part turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are  planned.  In order to comply with the COMBS turn around times, the  contractor must assure that sufficient spares are available or other  arrangements are in place to assure that these times are met. Other  metrics and your suggestions for metrics will be considered.    A  technical data package (most current configuration) will be available in  Aug/Sep 2007.  The contractor must comply with the International Traffic  in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 3.  A companion program will be managed by ASC for software and  (potentially) hardware block upgrades to the T-38C avionics suite that are  necessary to assure that the T-38C AUP continues to provide AETC with  current up-to-date training capability.  Engineering and configuration  authority thus will rest with this ASC program.  The sustainment  contractor may need to establish associate contractor agreements with the  contractor performing the block upgrades.  The sustainment contractor  should plan for a low level of engineering change proposal activity  arising from the block upgrades, DMSMS, etc. 4. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an  offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>Please see the answers to the following questions that were asked:

1 It appears you are asking for a 60 month lease which is cancelable if funds are not approved for the following year.  Is that correct?

Yes.  Since funds are appropriated annually for the Federal Government, it can only spend what?s been appropriated for each particular Fiscal Year.

2 Paper Handling Solutions can meet the 2 hour response time as required by the bid.  Will other bidders who respond be required 
to meet this response time?  

The successful quoter must meet the 2 hour response time.


3. What does 4 color mean? 

It means 4 independent color heads or printing units.

4. Epic is a brand name for a delta dampening system.  Must the water system be an Epic brand only or can we supply the Ryobi delta dampening system, which is essentially the same system but not the Epic brand.

If it is an equivalent to the Epic with the same water control, then it doesn't have to be an Epic brand.

5. The bid calls for Alcohol (IPA)% controller and alcohol is now basically banned from use in almost all printing locations. That is very old technology and no one today sells equipment water systems that require alcohol in the fountain.

Although alcohol isn't banned yet, USDA will probably be using a substitute soon. The requirement should have stated the need for a PH controller.

6. Varnish and Drying system is listed.  Does that mean a coater is required on line or does that refer to the Infrared dryer that is        also mentioned in the bid. 

USDA is not asking for a varnish and drying system, but is asking for an infrared drying device or equivalent, which was under the heading of ?Varnish and Drying System?.

7. You do want perfecting on the press?

Yes.

8. CIP3 is not a problem but how will you do CIP3 from your front end?

USDA believes it will help with the ink key settings either now or the future.

9. Single impression cylinder is very much old technology and slows the press down because of all the gripper transfers.  Most presses          Today have gone to fewer gripper transfers not more gripper transfers.  Why would you require old technology?

An equivalent would be fine if the performance, such as drying is the same.

10. The plate thickness on the polyester plates off the Mitsubishi DPX are .008 not .006 as stated in the bid.

The requirement should have stated the .008.

11. Are the trade in amounts listed a required amount or simply an estimate?

They are just an estimate.
 
12.  The three items listed as must have features list an Epic
delta continuous dampening system.  That is a brand name limits any bidder to that water system only. 

The wording of "must have" was not intended to indicate these were the only requirements. They should have been under the description of salient characteristics at the beginning of the specs documents. The Epic delta continuous dampening system should have said "or equivalent" for this item.

**This synopsis has been extended and will not close until 6/4/07 at 6:00 p.m. daylight savings time.




The United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service has a requirement for a Lease to Own Purchase (LTOP) for 60 months for our Raleigh, North Carolina office, which will be funded by each fiscal year, as money becomes available.

A fully federally funded program, AmeriCorps NCCC engages young adults ages 18 to 24 in full time, residential national service.  Members are based at one of three campuses in Denver Colo.; Perry Point, MD; and Sacramento, CA and perform team based service in all fifty states.  Since the 2005 hurricanes the majority of service projects have focused on disaster relief and recovery in the Gulf Coast region. 
A long term goal of CNCS is to diversify funding effective fiscal year 2008 with an initial infusion of private sector support that will be expanded in subsequent program years.  The following questions are posed in order for CNCS to determine a reasonable path for evaluating alternative funding structures: 1.What possible approaches (models) should CNCS consider to achieve sustainable and significant infusion of private resources to shift AmeriCorps NCCC toward greater public/private partnership? 2.	What precedent has been set for government programs moving from a public model to a public/private model? a.What are the success stories and challenges? b.What have been the implications on Appropriations? c.What is a reasonable ?balance? or proportion of public/private funding while maintaining the core purpose of the NCCC?  In the short and the long-terms? 3.Are there specific resource development approaches that should be avoided if we want to maintain a strong federal alignment? Organizations responding to this Notice should have significant, demonstrated experience moving publicly funded institutions into a public/private model.  Again, this is not a request for proposal, but rather a request for information to assist in the collection of market research data about the successes and challenges of engaging in this process.  If responses to the above questions exceed 10 pages, only the first 10 pages will be viewed. Background:The National Civilian Community Corps -- strengthens American communities and develops leaders through team-based national and community service. One of our nation's premier national service programs, the NCCC works in partnership with nonprofit and faith-based organizations, schools, and local, state and national agencies.  NCCC creates highly motivated, prescreened, rapidly deployable teams of American citizens trained in first aid, CPR, disaster relief, and firefighting who have responded to every major national disaster since 1994. NCCC teams have led the national service response in the Gulf Coast following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, devoting 65% of its resources to recovery efforts and providing a desperately needed lifeline to devastated individuals, families, and communities. In meeting local, state, and regional priorities, NCCC has earned its reputation as a valued partner in environmental, youth development, housing, and disaster mitigation projects since its inception in 1994. AmeriCorps NCCC has completed more than 6,000 projects and logged nearly 20 million service hours, valued conservatively at $360 million since it was established 13 years ago.  Over 1,000 hard-working members, ages 18-24, serve annually investing nearly two million service hours in communities in every state on service projects that are deemed essential by local communities.  Teams have planted hundreds of thousands of trees, bushes, and seedlings, helped construct or renovate 6,000 homes, constructed or renovated 7,800 miles of hiking trails, tutored or mentored thousands of youth, and assisted hundreds of thousands of citizens in need.  The NCCC?s decentralized, residential, team-based military model and its nimble, ready response capacity are key to its effectiveness.  The NCCC is a critical component of U.S. disaster mitigation, response, relief, and recovery efforts. Teams were on the ground before Katrina hit landfall in August of 2005.  NCCC members, although just 1.5% of the national service membership, completed 50% of the 800,000 service hours in the Gulf Coast that supported the disaster relief and recovery effort in 2006. 
NCCC is the only service program that the Corporation for National and Community Service manages directly.  Its decentralized structure fosters community partnerships and attention to local needs.   Regional bases ensure a membership body that is flexible, fully prepared, and readily deployable in an array of environments and situations. NCCC also serves as a research and development laboratory demonstrating how to effectively engage young adults in high intensity, rigorous domestic service experiences. The ability to track and monitor activities and accomplishments of the services provided and the members who serve provides a rich source of data. Oversight of a highly structured and deployable national service program allows the epicenter for national service to develop and implement programming that tests theories and strategies, and responds immediately to changing priorities.AmeriCorps NCCC is developing civically engaged leaders of tomorrow.From regional residential campuses structured by top-level military leadership, NCCC molds leaders of high performing, cohesive teams who serve in local communities throughout the country.  An intense four week training institute not only prepares members for service but also generates leaders who can effectively manage large numbers of volunteers at any given time.  In 2006, NCCC members coordinated the work of 73,000 total volunteers or 65 volunteers per member.  The NCCC will launch a Public Service Fellows program in 2008 that will provide expanded training and service learning opportunities for select members who want to pursue federal, non-profit and teaching careers.  Implementation of a Summer of Service program for youth ages 14 to 17 in 2007 will expose more youth from disadvantaged circumstances to community service, and meaningful civic engagement and leadership opportunities.The AmeriCorps NCCC program is based on a multi-dimensional commitment to education and American communities.
Through community education and structural modifications, NCCC helps American businesses and communities with preparedness and disaster mitigation. NCCC tutors students in disadvantaged and disaster-affected areas, helping build and rebuild communities.  In partnership with higher education, NCCC provides the opportunity to earn educational credit through service and an educational stipend to graduates, who bring invaluable experience to the academic community.  Through civic education and hands-on service-learning experience, NCCC maximizes corps members? effectiveness and produces exceptional leaders.

<DESC>***This modification to the sources sought announcement extends the response date to 10 June 2007 and corrects the small business size standard.***  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to  determine interest and availability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business concerns for hydraulic dredging at Westport     River & Harbor, Massachusetts.     The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a size s tandard of $18,500,000.00.     The estimated cost range is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The Westport River & Harbor is located in the Town of Westport, Massachusetts, on the shore of Buzzards Bay, bordering Rhode Island.     The harbor is a coastal est uary with an inlet opening south into Buzzards Bay between a barrier beach to the east and head land to the west.     The harbor has general depths of 8 to 15 feet below mean lower low water (mllw), while the entrance has a controlling depth of about 6 fee t below mllw.     The proposed project consists of dredging an entrance channel, 9 feet mlw by 150 to 200 feet wide, through the inlet to Westport Harbor (from RN12 to GC-23).     The channel would connect deep water in Buzzards Bay with deep water in the harbor, a distance of about 9,700 feet, of which only three areas, totaling about 4,550 feet of channel r equire dredging.     Disposal site is a 2,400-foot long section of Horseneck Beach located between 1,600 and 4,000 feet east of the inlet.     The req uired approach is to place about 19,500 cubic yards of clean sand onto the Town-owned portion of Horseneck Beach , and working the material on the beach to establish appropriate beach profiles.     A one-foot allowable over depth and side slopes of one on three are included in the channel design and quantities.     Sediment Characteristics:     The results of grain size analy sis indicated that the proposed dredged material is composed of approximately 99% sand.       The sandy material is dominated by fine  and medium grained sands.     Sea State Conditions:       from October through January, northerly winds result in calm waters inside marker RN-8.     Strong southerly winds may produce 5 foot swells.     Outgoing tide may produce currents up to 4 knots.    Storm events may result in swells greater than 5 feet.     The environmental dredging window for this project permits work from October 1, 2007     through January 31, 2008. Interested contractors should submit a capabilities package to include the foll owing: business classification size (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.), projects similar to the work described above, and a list of equipment.     Responses should be limited to five pages .     This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor  is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.     Responses are required no later than 10 June 2007.     Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of En gineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01 742-2751, ATTN: David Dilks (CT-C).     Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.     The government will not pay for any material provided in respons e to this market survey nor return the data provided.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.

<DESC>Department of Defense (DoD) Business Transformation Agency (BTA) Request for Information (RFI) BTA Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) and Laws, Regulations, and Policy (LRP) Support Draft BTA Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) and Laws, Regulations, and Policy (LRP) Support SUBJECT The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) is conducting a survey to find available Small Businesses to perform the  following functions. Large businesses capable of performing these functions should also forward their qualifications. In  the event that not enough Small Businesses are available, a full and open competition will be solicited. Please provide the following information in your response: * Experience in performing similar tasks * Personnel qualifications * Corporate size DESCRIPTION The mission of the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) is to guide the transformation of business operations throughout  the Department of Defense and to deliver Enterprise-level capabilities that align to warfighter needs.  The BTA will be  recognized as the champion for driving and accelerating improvements to business operations across the Department of  Defense. The BTA will serve as a magnet to attract talented, dedicated professionals, creating a model for transformation  leadership across the federal government. The Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) is the enterprise architecture for the Department of Defense (DoD) Business  Mission Area (BMA) and includes activities, processes, data standards, business rules, operating requirements, and  information exchanges. The BEA is developed using a set of integrated DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) products. The BEA  defines DoD's business transformation priorities, the Business Capabilities required to support those priorities, and the  combinations of systems and initiatives that enable these capabilities.  The purpose of this RFI is to detail the tasks and responsibilities needed to support the BTA requirements for  optimization, maintenance and implementation of the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) compliance requirements Laws,  Regulations, and Policy (LRP) repository and support for the ongoing management and maintenance of the LRP and their  linkage to the System Architect (SA) application for the BEA.   The primary purpose of the Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) work is to support the government in  identifying all laws, policies, regulations and other constraints and representing them in the BEA.  This requires the  ability to adapt quickly to changing methods and content and to provide outputs in various forms to our customers.  It is  also required to develop and keep current documentation of the processes and procedures related to these efforts.     REQUIREMENTS Task 1 - Data Repository Support The Contractor shall provide continued support for Systems Architect and Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System  (DOORS). This support includes: "	Consulting/ coordinating/ documenting configuration, troubleshooting, maintenance, and upgrades with the technical  support provider and related vendors, for DOORS to ensure continued successful operation in support of the BEA. "	Licensing management for DOORS across the BTA, to include BEP representatives and other customers of the BTA. "	Coordination and resolution of tools access and usage for the entire BTA user community  "	Consulting/ coordination/ documenting on all technical support requirements related to the appropriate platform  and operating environment to support effective and efficient support of DOORS across the BTA. "	Primary focal point and liaison for the BTA Chief Information Officer (CIO) with BTA components for developmental  efforts or requirements, with the responsibility for ensuring requirements are fully documented within the BTA Bu siness  Case Template for submission and appropriate tasking. "	Support IT Governance and IT Architecture development for the BTA. Deliverable/Delivery Schedule * DOORS User Profiles/As required * DOORS Upgrade Test Results/As required * DOORS Business Case Template/As required * Status Report/Weekly Task 2 - Support for Laws, Regulations, and Policies (LRP) Repository and Other Business Requirements The Contractor shall support the government in identifying all laws, policies, regulations and other constraints and  representing them in the BEA.  The Contractor shall:  * Capture new and/or modified constraints, identify constraints related to architectural changes, and provide the material  to subject matter experts for their analysis. * Receive new and/or modified mapped constraints from subject matter experts * Update the LRP Repository * Refine the LRP repository to highlight compliance requirements specific to DoD for development, acquisition or  implementation of a system which supports a given business process or operational activity.  Implement a more focused  BEA/LRP integration that would significantly increase the value of the BEA to those acquiring, developing, and  implementing business information systems. Thus the BEA will indicate which 20% of applicable LRPs address 90% of the most  important business requirements. * Update LRPs * Update the LRP Source List and other constraint reports if necessary * Support the Government with reviewing and analyzing relevant architecture constraints requirements and sources to verify  they are current, relevant, non-contradictory, and parsed correctly.  * Provide refined/modified constraints to subject matter experts for validation * Prepare and process change requests to update the LRP Repository based on the approval process * Support the Government with managing and defining the overall compliance requirement management process.

<DESC>The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Code 427, seeks capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business goals for procurement of the LDCM Mission Operations Element (MOE).  See draft Statement of Work and draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) on the LDCM web site at http://ldcm.nasa.gov. The NAICS Code is 541512 with a size standard of $23 million.  Your response must specifically address capabilities and past experience in developing comprehensive satellite mission operations hardware and software systems, including command and control, command encryption/authentication, planning and scheduling, flight dynamics, trending and analysis, memory and flight software management, and automation capabilities.  Your response must also address your CMM Maturity level or CMMI-SE/SW Capability level designation as referred to in Section 2.5.1 of NPR 7150.2, NASA Software Engineering Requirements.  Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of six (6) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described in the draft SOW.  Two (2) copies of capability statements shall be submitted to the GSFC, Code 210.6, Greenbelt, MD 20771, Attn: Michelle D. McIntyre or e-mail a copy to Michelle.D.McIntyre@nasa.gov on or before June 15, 2007.  To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one (1) page summary, to be counted within the six-page limit, shall be affixed to the front of the capability statement submitted which identifies for the evaluator, by page and paragraph, your company's relevant capabilities.  It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.	Additionally, responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Procurement related questions should be directed to Michelle D. McIntyre, via email Michelle.D.McIntyre@nasa.gov or at 301-286-7458.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<SUBJECT>B -- MULTIPLEXING FDX-B PIT TAG TRANSCEIVER SYSTEM

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns capable of satisfying the below requirement.

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement for a replacement FDX-B PIT-tag transceiver that can operate multiple antennas for in-stream applications.  The main purpose of a multiplexing transceiver is to record information on tagged fish that pass within the reading field of the installed antennas. The transceiver must be able to auto-tune the antennas as environmental conditions (e.g., water levels) change, consume low power, and control the multiple antennas needed to span the width of streams and rivers. With an improved multiplexing transceiver, the government anticipates being able to monitor larger rivers than is presently possible.  This might be accomplished by installing multiple transceivers at a single location or by having a transceiver that could control a minimum of 12 individual antennas with a faster switch time between antennas than the present 30 msec.
In order for the multiplexing transceiver to have the flexibility to work well for known and future unknown applications, the government wants to separate the transceiver electronics into multiple enclosures based on function.  In other words, to have the electronics necessary for the antenna performance be located in an enclosure installed near the stream and have the electronics for control and data collection be located in an enclosure installed farther away from the stream (e.g., 500-1000 ft away).  In this transceiver concept, there would be one satellite antenna-controller node (ACN) for each antenna.  Each ACN would communicate with a master controller (MC) where the data would be stored. Since the separate enclosure approach has not been used in previous PIT-tag transceivers, the government require the development of the new multiplexing transceiver to be done in phases to ensure that the satellite antenna-controller node approach works before proceeding to work on developing the more traditional parts of the transceiver.   
Vendors must have (1) experience designing FDX-B PIT-tag transceivers for fisheries applications, (2) experience designing multiplexing PIT-tag transceivers, and (3) experience designing PIT-tag antennas for stream applications, and will be required to accomplish the following requirements:

(1) Develop a document that describes the overall multiplexing transceiver including functional level descriptions of both the master controller and an individual antenna controller node. This document will include a description of all of the features of the multiplexing transceiver system as well as all of the host interfaces.  The deliverable shall be a document describing the system design within one month after a contract is issued.
(2) Development of the Antenna Controller Node - Functional Engineering Prototype:  The contractor will design and develop a ?stand alone? ACN.  Each ACN will be able to operate independently and provide a serial output that contains received tag information.  The design will include all aspects of the ACNs:  hardware (both analog and digital), software, communication protocols, and the design criteria for the antennas that will be attached to them.  Each ACN must minimally be able to operate a 20 ft x 4 ft antenna.  The water-tight enclosure for an ACN will also be developed, but not prototyped.  The deliverable will be a functional engineering prototype of a stand-alone CAN without a water-tight enclosure, and will include a functioning 20 ft x 4 ft antenna. The deliverable will be required within five months after award of the contract.
(3)	Development of the Master Controller - Functional Engineering Prototype: 
The contractor will design and develop the MC.  During this phase the MC hardware and software will be developed including the communication protocols to the ACNs and to the host.  At this point, the software will include the basic tag-recording function as well as limited reporting and diagnostic capabilities. The deliverable will be a functional engineering prototype of a system with one MC and two ACNs (and their antennas), and will include prototype water-tight enclosures.  This deliverable will be required 6 months after item (2) above has been accomplished.

(4)	Final design completion with delivery of a complete system:
The contractor will incorporate additional reporting and diagnostic capabilities to the system.  In addition, the hardware for the ACN or MC will be modified as necessary. The deliverable will be one complete transceiver system that includes one MC and a minimum of six ACNs in their final enclosures.  Furthermore, it will include the full complement of diagnostic capabilities and be delivered with the different types of manuals (e.g., user and maintenance) requested by the fisheries community in the requirements document.  Delivery of the complete system is required within 5 months after item (3) above has been accomplished.
  
It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) will be awarded.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All vendors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.  NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.  All interested parties must respond to this announcement by June 11, 2007.  Documentation to support the vendor?s capability must be in writing and include the vendor?s name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS Number, CCR Cage Number, business type and size, i.e., small, large, non-profit, educational, etc.; and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the services as described above.  Any response that does not include this information will not be considered.  The Government will review each response to determine if the vendor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is planning on awarding, on a sole source basis, to the Association for Prevention Teaching and Research (APTR), a contract to administer AHRQ?s residency rotation for Preventive Medicine and Primary Care residents.  These rotations will provide an opportunity for Preventive Medicine Residents and other trainees with advanced public health training to gain practical experience in secondary data development and assessment, to participate in drafting health policy papers, and to contribute to the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).   This organization has administered this program for AHRQ since 1998.

The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.301-1.  For this requirement, sources must have a residency rotation program that can supply the required number of residents for the rotation assignments.  Overall administration of the program is required, including processing payments for resident stipends and providing for evaluations of the rotation experiences.

Interested organizations capable of performing the above with the requisite qualifications and expertise, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirements as described above no later than June 14, 2007, by 12:00 noon.  No solicitation document is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Jacquelyn Carey at jackie.carey@ahrq.hhs.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monoroney Aeronautical Center, Product Services Division Division, AML-4000; Navigation/Landing/Weather Product Division, AML-7000; and Automation/Communication Product Division, AML-8000 have a requirement for the acquisition of approximately 96 Teknion Leverage and Expansion Furniture Systems workstations and related products(refer typicals); in support of their mission in the National Airspace System (NAS). National Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 337214. Based upon the requiring offices' justification for single source-brand name acquisition; In accordance with Acquisition Management Policy 3.2.2.4, it is in the best interest of the FAA to procure the FAA Logistics Center (AML) furniture from a single source in order to meet time constraints and maintain standardization throughout the organization.   Through a market survey and a technical evaluation conducted in March 2006, only one source was found to satisfy all the technical requirements.  Due to the number of competing projects in the FAA Logistics Center as well as throughout the MMAC, furniture products must already be procured and ready to install when the project is complete.  When this does not occur, there is a domino effect which impacts the new space and vacated space for the employee, manager, organization, and the MMAC overall.  These impacts are further compounded by the organization's ability to meet their mission and goals. In February 2006, a full and open solicitation was conducted through the Office of Acquisition Services to provide potential offerors the opportunity to bid on major furniture contract.    Six offerors provided their manufacturer's product.  Of these six offerors, the evaluation team determined that Teknion Furniture Products meets all of the technical specifications for best value procurement.  This procurement will be utilizing components identical to the existing contract and will maintain standardization of the furniture specifications and existing warranties. With timing comes the need for standardization.  Due to the sheer volume of projects that are ongoing throughout the Logistics Center, it is equally important to standardize furniture with Teknion products.  There are a number of benefits AML receives from standardization that are substantial.  The most critical factor is the 24" requirement to separate power and data for powered systems furniture.  According to FAA Standard, powered systems furniture must have 24" separation between power and data.  Teknion's product meets this requirement for system furniture and it has been a proven product in a number of applications.  Teknion top data channels will accommodate a maximum of 60 CAT 5 cables for future expansion, which we did not find in other manufacturer products.  The FAA herein announces its intention to award a Firm Fixed Price Type Contract to Teknion LLC. This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  DOT, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $750,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning STLP, call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<DESC>Scope of Work per Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Section of Yellowstone National Park LOG HAND CRAFTING AND PLACEMENT TO CONSTRUCT A FISH BARRIER BACKGROUND Artificial fish barriers constructed to prevent the upstream movement of nonnative/hybridized fish species and protect headwater populations of imperiled, native fish species have been used successfully in many locations including several national parks.  The structures allow for the isolation and protection of native fishes without depending solely on the presence/use of natural barriers to fish movement (waterfalls).  This greatly increases the available options and overall probability of success for native fish restoration projects, in part because the native fish are re-introduced into previously occupied waters within the historical range of the species.  It also ensures that historically fishless waters, usually located above waterfalls (and outside of the historical range of the species), are not the only habitats available to managers considering native fish restoration projects.  This method, at present, represents the best available technology for preventing invasion by nonnative/hybridized fishes into a restoration area, especially one that is located in a remote, backcountry location.  In instances where native cutthroat trout are immediately threatened by nonnative fish species, research has shown that isolation by artificial barrier construction may be the only alternative. SITE LOCATION The site chosen for construction of the fish barrier is located in the backcountry of Yellowstone National Park, within the East Fork Specimen Creek watershed.  The site is located in a relatively steep, timbered canyon approximately 3 miles east of the Specimen Creek Trailhead and approximately  mile from the nearest park trail. The Specimen Creek trailhead is located along Highway 191 near mile marker 26, north of West Yellowstone, Gallatin County, Montana.   WORK DETAILS In order to complete the East Fork Specimen Creek fish barrier project National Park Service fisheries staff require the assistance of a contractor that specializes in designing and constructing log structures.  The fish barrier will be a 1.8 m (6 feet) in height, artificial waterfall built within the creek channel and designed to completely impede upstream fish movement.  The structure will span the entire width of the creek bed (approximately 18 ft at the site) behind (upstream of) large, existing boulders, and will be anchored on each end into the stream bank.  The overall width of the structure will be approximately 8.2 m (26.9 ft) wide (floodprone width of the channel).  The structure will be constructed in such a way that its thickness will be a width of two logs side-by-side, and approximately 1 m (3.3 feet) thickness.   The logs will be handcrafted to fit within the stream channel and among existing rock boulders in such a way that no gaps exist that would allow fish to pass through the structure.  Logs for the construction will be cut from the surrounding area and prepared on site.  Crews from the National Park Service and the Montana Conservation Corps will be on-site to assist in felling, moving, and preparing the logs.  Unnatural materials such as log screws, rebar, redi-rod, steel, cable, and mortar (cement mixed with sand) would also be used to tie the structure together and anchor into the stream bank.  The NPS will procure and supply the required materials for constructing the barrier. During the barrier construction, NPS and MCC crews will dewater the stream channel via an above-ground diversion channel built from local deadfall and lined with waterproof material.  Although a majority of flow will be diverted from the channel, it is likely that at least some water flow will remain within the channel in the location for barrier construction. Contractor must consider costs of transportation, housing, meals, and other expenses when scoping this project, as these will not be provided by the NPS. EXPERTISE REQUIRED The contractor will need expertise in the selection, preparation and handcrafting of raw logs using only chain saws or hand tools.  The contractor will need expertise in the shaping of logs to fit within an irregular space, such as a rock-boulder creek bed. The contractor will need expertise in the placement of handcrafted logs similar to what would occur during the construction of a custom log home.  The contractor will need expertise in methods used to assemble handcrafted logs and properly tie together to ensure structural integrity of the fish barrier.   PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS The contractor must be physically able to hike in steep terrain off-trail while carrying chain saws and other heavy (> 50 pounds) of gear.  No mechanization will be allowed to access the barrier site or the primitive camp site. WORK RESTRICTIONS The fish barrier is being constructed within Yellowstone National Park and a proposed wilderness area.  According to an already completed Environmental Assessment for the project, the structure is to be built of mostly native materials (logs and rocks) using a minimal amount of mechanization.  Use of chainsaws is allowed.  The handcrafted logs will be tied together using unnatural materials such as log screws, rebar, redi-rod, steel, cable, and mortar. No mechanization is allowed to access the barrier site, approximately 3 miles east of the Specimen Creek trailhead.  Chainsaws and other gear must be packed in to the barrier site, and may remain at the site for the duration of the project.   Stock may be used to transport gear to a point along the pack trail near the barrier site.  However, stock must be immediately returned to the trailhead.  Resource damage is a serious concern and there are no areas near the barrier site suitable for tying or otherwise holding stock for any extended period of time. Contractors and other crews cannot camp at the barrier site.  However, if the contractor crew consists of only 2-3 individuals (expected contractor crew size), an option exists for them to camp with NPS and MCC crews involved with the project at park service camp site WC-3, located along the pack trail 2 miles east of Highway 191, and approximately 1 mile from the barrier site.  If this option is taken, the contractors must follow guidance by NPS and MCC crews for low impact, primitive camping at site WC-3, and must follow all park rules regarding backcountry camping available at http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/backcountrytripplanner.htm.  Stock cannot be held at the campsite at any time. TIMELINE The contractor will be on site beginning 20 August 2007 and remain for two ten-day periods.  The periods will be August 20th - 29th and September 4th - 13th.  The daily work schedule at the barrier site will be 7am - 5 pm with additional hours as required.  The work may occur during periods of inclement weather. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS The contractor will report to the NPS fisheries biologist on site.  The contractor will work in collaboration with NPS and MCC crew members on site to complete the project.  The contractor will lead efforts to select, handcraft, place, and secure logs.  The contractor will mentor and guide NPS and MCC crew members in the process of selecting, handcrafting, placing, and securing logs to construct the fish barrier. LIABILITY Structural integrity of the fish barrier is ultimately the responsibility of the NPS, which has created the conceptual design for the project.  Although the NPS is relying on the contractor for technical expertise, liability associated with any failure of the barrier in the future lies solely with Yellowstone National park.

<DESC>The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is seeking sources to make improvements to its Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) computer modeling system. The purpose of FVS is to simulate forest stand characteristics over time, including various management activities. One component of the system is the creation of input files for the Stand Visualization System (SVS), which allows users to view computer-generated pictures of their forest stands through time. The purpose of this proposed contracted effort is to fix some known problems with the SVS input files so that the SVS input files, and their associated pictures, better match stand dynamics as they are tracked in the FVS. The contractor must be proficient with the FVS source code which is written in FORTRAN and is very complex. The Government has limited resources for this effort (approximately 33K) and the selected contractor must have the ability to perform the desired programming work in a timely and proficient manner. The application is in the public domain and is available for down load from the following web site: http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/software/index.php. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 3:00 p.m. local time on June 07, 2007.

Description:
This performance specification describes the performance requirements for a managed, Layer-2 switching, 10/100/1000 Base-T commercial Ethernet Switch to be used for a non-flight critical avionics bus on the A/MH-6M aircraft.  The Ethernet Switch shall have a minimum of 10 commercial ports that are fully interoperable with other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  The Ethernet Switch shall be packaged as a single line replaceable unit (LRU).  One Ethernet switch is required for each aircraft (quantity addressed further below).  The Ethernet Switch shall be required to pass MIL-STD-810F environmental testing and MIL-STD-461E E3 testing.  The Ethernet Switch shall be fully IEEE 802.3 compliant.

1.0	Real-Time Deterministic Services:  The switch shall operate in a deterministic manner with guaranteed delivery and bounded latency, and compliant with ARINC 664, part 5, Profiled Aircraft Data Networks.

2.0	Ethernet Ports:  The Ethernet Switch shall have a minimum 10 commercial full-duplex ports.

3.0	Additional ports:  The Ethernet Switch shall have one non-dedicated data load port.  An out of band serial management port and a 10/100 Base-T debug port are desired.

4.0	Connectors:  The Ethernet switch shall have MIL-SPEC connectors suitable for aviation use.  

5.0	Software:  The software shall be RTCA/DO-178B Level C compliant.  The system should be capable of power-up built in test (PBIT), initiated built-in-test (IBIT), and continuous built-in-test (CBIT).  The software should allow flexible network management, monitoring, and configuration capability via Command Line Interface (CLI), Telnet, Web, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) interfaces.

6.0	Power:  The Ethernet switch shall comply with MIL-STD-704A 28VDC aircraft power interface requirements.  The switch operations shall not be affected by voltage transients down to 15 VDC or up to 40 VDC lasting up to 100 ms.  Power dissipation shall be no greater than 40 watts during peak power operation.

7.0	Cooling:  The switch shall not require active cooling and should be designed to operate continuously between -40?a C and +55?a C.

8.0	Profiled Aircraft Data Network:   The Ethernet Switch shall be fully operable in a Compliant Aircraft Data Network, as defined by ARINC Specification 664.

9.0	Policy-Based Forwarding Service Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall check the fields of each frame, and forward frames that meet the valid criteria.  The Ethernet switch shall evaluate the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of a frame contained in the frame check sequence field according to IEEE 802.3.  In case a reception failure is detected, the frame should be discarded.  The Ethernet Switch shall drop an incoming frame which size is greater than the maximum allowed frame size associated with it.  This value shall be configurable for values between minimum and maximum permissible frame size.

10.0	  Switching Services:  The Ethernet Switch shall implement ??Store-and-forward?? mechanism to allow frame integrity filtering prior to initiating the forwarding process.  The Ethernet Switch shall discard corrupted frames.

11.0	  Frame Forwarding:  The Ethernet Switch should be designed to avoid head-of-line blocking.  Head-of-line blocking is frame loss or added delay caused by an input interface which is attempting to forward frames to both an uncongested and congested output interface, resulting in frames dropped or delayed at the uncongested output due to congestion in the congested output.  The Ethernet Switch shall drop frames only for the congested port.  The uncongested ports shall remain unaffected.

12.0	 Fault Detection:  The Ethernet Switch shall monitor the status of its centralized functions as well as network interfaces in-accordance-with (IAW) IEEE Std 802.3 and 802.1D.

13.0	  Performance Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall meet the requirements as defined by ARINC specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.10.

14.0	  Maximum Switch Transit Delay:  The Ethernet Switch shall meet the latency requirements defined by ARINC specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.10.4.4.  The maximum latency induced by the Ethernet Switch for any time frame should be less than 1 ms. 

15.0	  Operational Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall be compliant with ARINC Specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.11.

16.0	  Configuration Tables:  The Ethernet Switch shall use configuration tables in order to make policy-based forwarding decisions.  Consequently, configuration tables shall be uploadable to enable evolution of system architecture.  The table shall be sized such that a minimum of 256 traffic flows are supported by the switch.

17.0	  Electromagnetic Testing:  The Ethernet switch shall meet MIL-STD-461E, Requirements for Control of Electromagnetic Interference, Emissions and Susceptibility.  The following tests are required:  RE101, CS 101, CS114, CS115, CS116, and RS 101.

<DESC>Department of Defense (DoD) Business Transformation Agency (BTA) Request for Information (RFI) BTA Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) and Laws, Regulations, and Policy (LRP) Support Draft BTA Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) and Laws, Regulations, and Policy (LRP) Support SUBJECT The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) is conducting a survey to find available Small Businesses to perform the  following functions. Large businesses capable of performing these functions should also forward their qualifications. In  the event that not enough Small Businesses are available, a full and open competition will be solicited. Please provide the following information in your response: * Experience in performing similar tasks * Personnel qualifications * Corporate size DESCRIPTION The mission of the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) is to guide the transformation of business operations throughout  the Department of Defense and to deliver Enterprise-level capabilities that align to warfighter needs.  The BTA will be  recognized as the champion for driving and accelerating improvements to business operations across the Department of  Defense. The BTA will serve as a magnet to attract talented, dedicated professionals, creating a model for transformation  leadership across the federal government. The Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) is the enterprise architecture for the Department of Defense (DoD) Business  Mission Area (BMA) and includes activities, processes, data standards, business rules, operating requirements, and  information exchanges. The BEA is developed using a set of integrated DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) products. The BEA  defines DoD's business transformation priorities, the Business Capabilities required to support those priorities, and the  combinations of systems and initiatives that enable these capabilities.  The purpose of this RFI is to detail the tasks and responsibilities needed to support the BTA requirements for  optimization, maintenance and implementation of the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) compliance requirements Laws,  Regulations, and Policy (LRP) repository and support for the ongoing management and maintenance of the LRP and their  linkage to the System Architect (SA) application for the BEA.   The primary purpose of the Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) work is to support the government in  identifying all laws, policies, regulations and other constraints and representing them in the BEA.  This requires the  ability to adapt quickly to changing methods and content and to provide outputs in various forms to our customers.  It is  also required to develop and keep current documentation of the processes and procedures related to these efforts.     REQUIREMENTS Task 1 - Data Repository Support The Contractor shall provide continued support for Systems Architect and Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System  (DOORS). This support includes: "	Consulting/ coordinating/ documenting configuration, troubleshooting, maintenance, and upgrades with the technical  support provider and related vendors, for DOORS to ensure continued successful operation in support of the BEA. "	Licensing management for DOORS across the BTA, to include BEP representatives and other customers of the BTA. "	Coordination and resolution of tools access and usage for the entire BTA user community  "	Consulting/ coordination/ documenting on all technical support requirements related to the appropriate platform  and operating environment to support effective and efficient support of DOORS across the BTA.

<SUBJECT>59 -- INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA SOURCE
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Trion Technology for an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source unit that will enhance the use of a recently purchased reactive ion etching (RIE) system (Minilock-Phantom III). The compact, vacuum load-locked reactive ion etcher (RIE) is designed to supply research and failure analysis labs with state-of-the-art plasma etch capability using single wafers (up to 200mm), dies or parts. Samples are loaded into the process chamber via the vacuum load-lock. This feature increases user safety by preventing contact with the process chamber and any residual etch by-products. The load-lock also allows the chamber to remain permanently under vacuum thereby keeping out moisture and keeping the reaction chamber free of possible corrosion.  The ICP source will result in improved etch rates and profile control, improved uniformity, greatly increased selectivity and a dramatic reduction in radiation damage and contamination from RIE sputtering.  Some applications benefiting from this technology are oxide, III-V materials, polyimide, polysilicon and active devices which are affected by radiation.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Trion Technology is currently assembling our Minilock-Phantom III RIE system
and the use of another vendor ICP source unit would make the warranty void on the RIE system. Trion's computer control and software for the Minilock-Phantom III is also incompatible with ICP source units from other vendors. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  All technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by e-mail before June 15, 2007.  Anticipated award date will be June 18, 2007.

<DESC>Special Notice SN07-37: BLOOD PHARMING Workshop; 
WORKSHOP DATE: June 29, 2007; 
REGISTRATION DEADLINE: June 20, 2007; 
TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Jon Mogford, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4928, Fax: (703) 741-7845; Email: BAA07-21@darpa.mil; URL: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=524

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Workshop to discuss innovative research that will enable development of an automated progenitor cell-based culture system to produce a donor-less supply of universal donor (Type ?O? negative) red blood cells (RBCs) for combat casualty care. It is envisioned that RBCs of normal structure and function will be produced and that the automated culture system would process cells from starter population to packaged RBC unit ready for transfusion. Complete program metrics will be specified in a forthcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).

The Blood Pharming Workshop will be held at 3601 Wilson Blvd, Suite 600, Arlington, VA, 22201. The goal of the workshop is to explore: 1) culture techniques that stimulate and support the efficient and large-scale production of mature red blood cells from human progenitor cells and 2) automated cell culture systems capable of large-scale implementation of progenitor cell expansion and RBC differentiation protocols.

Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing previous or potential research in the area in order to facilitate discussions and formation of well-rounded teams. It is expected that the successful team will possess expertise in human progenitor cell biology and erythroid differentiation; RBC physiology, cellular support matrices/scaffolds; automated cell culture systems, and cell sorting, purification and packaging. In addition, teams should be led by a strong System?s Integrator and have experience with the FDA approval process for transfusable products. For poster submissions, a detailed description of the poster must be submitted by June 20, 2007, 4:00PM ET. A maximum of 20 4ft x 4ft posters can be accommodated.

There is no fee for the Blood Pharming Workshop. Details on the workshop, including registration and poster information, can be found at the following URL: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=524. The password for login is: arlington

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 50 people, maximum 2 from each institution). The registration cutoff date is June 20, 2007, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted additional participants on a first-come, first-serve basis. Further administrative information is available from Ms. Carol Higgins (Carol.Higgins.ctr@darpa.mil). Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Jon Mogford (Jon.Mogford@darpa.mil). Please refer to the Blood Pharming Workshop in any correspondence. This special announcement is not a request for proposals.

For those interested but unable to attend, requests for DARPA materials presented at the workshop should be directed to Ms. Carol Higgins.

MODIFICATION OR WITHDRAWAL OF PROPOSALS:  Proposals may be modified or  withdrawn by written notice and a proposal also may be withdrawn in person  by a Bidder or his/her authorized repre-sentative, provided his/her  identity is made known and he/she signs a receipt for the proposal.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NT910713912KAR.  The proposed procurement is a Total Small Business set aside.  NAICS Code:  333315.  Small Business Size Standard: 500 Employees. 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), requires a professional quality High Definition TV (HDTV) Video Camcorder.  The HDTV video camcorder must fully support the 1080p HDTV standard and must have a CCD sensor with a minimum native resolution of at 1920 x 1080 pixels with minimum progressive scan frame rate of 29.97 frames per second (fps).  Higher 1080p progressive scan rates up to 60 fps are desired and will be considered a plus when evaluating proposals.  To meet low level light gathering requirements (i.e., high sensitivity), the CCD sensor(s) used by the camera must be either of the 3-chip 2/3 inch size (i.e., a separate 2/3 inch chip for each red, green, and blue color) or of the 1-chip 35 mm size (i.e., an approximately 4 times larger chip that is shared for all three colors).  The CCD pixel values must be sampled with at least 12 bits of resolution and have an effective dynamic range of at least 66 db.  Other requirements include uncompressed HD-SDI output with embedded audio (single link for 1080i/720p and dual link for 1080p), color LCD and EVF (Electronic View Finder) for on-camera viewing of the video picture, the ability to run on battery power (including battery and charger), and  small size and weight less than 12 lbs (for portability).  The HDTV camcorder must have the ability to record compressed native resolution 1080p video (without filtering) to an on-camera non-perishable format (e.g., tape, flash memory, RAID) with at least 40 minutes of contiguous recording capacity using a high quality video compression method (e.g., H.264, wavelet) with a bit rate of at least 140 Mega bits per second (Mbps).  The HDTV camcorder must have the ability to record at least 4 channels of uncompressed digital AES/EBU broadcast quality audio (48 kHz) synchronous with the recorded video.

Vendors must provide the brand name Enterasys part numbers for the switches (CLINS 0001, 0002, 0003).  Following is the justification to limit sources to the brand name product:
DDC has installed local area networks; LANs, throughout its Distribution Depots across the globe supporting the DLA logistical mission to support the War Fighter. Each depot has its own network installed per IEEE 802.3, EIA/TIA, and DLA standards and policies comprised of a sole manufacturer network hardware configuration. 

This sole manufacturer network hardware configuration has enhanced our management capabilities of DDC funds by reducing the number of maintenance support contracts, decreasing the multiple vendor training requirements for site IT personnel, and eliminating the need for various ancillary IT equipment or software installations required to allow functionality between multi vendor equipment. 

The configuration of our network using equipment from a sole manufacturer strengthens network management abilities allowing the identification of specific data software tools used for local area/wide area network management oversight. This increases our effectiveness to maintain DDC networks that are functional, dependable and available in support of our mission. 

Enterasys network switching equipment is the hardware installed at the Distribution Depot located in DDSP New Cumberland, PA. This standardization was planned in part due to the network infrastructure configuration at the time of the DDC stand up. The use of Enterasys SecureStack C2 and C3 network switching platforms will enhance network capabilities using key features as: 

SecureStack C2:
	The extensive security features built into all SecureStack C2 switches make them an important part of Enterasys Secure Networks, and enable Secure Networks to be extended to the network edge. 
	A single stack density is now increased to an industry-leading 360 gigabit ports or 384 10/100 ports with 32 gigabit uplinks.
	Reliability and availability is assured with support for Closed Loop Stacking, redundant core connections, redundant power options and redundant stack management. 
	Maintain existing network hardware architecture enabling ease of integration into the current network management configuration.  

SecureStack C3: 
	The extensive security features built into all SecureStack C3 switches make them an important part of Enterasys Secure Networks, and enable Secure Networks to be extended to the network edge. 
	The SecureStack C3 delivers an industry leading 384 Gigabit ports in a single stack. 
	The C3 provides extensive security features and is an important part of extending Enterasys Secure Networks to the network edge. 
	The extensive Layer 2 and Layer 3 feature set includes optional support for IPv6. 

Vendors may propose a either brand name or equal product for the transceivers (CLINS 0003, 0004).  Salient characteristics for those products are listed below.

5.	Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications: 

The Secretary of Defense Communications Critical Infrastructure Branch has a legal requirement and obligation to provide information as requested in a timely manner for Freedom of Information Act and Congressional Inquiries. The ability to store a large amount of data for review on a system that can be integrated and migrated between production networks without network interruption is critical to completing these tasks. 

a.	The storage solution must be able to operate as 2 independently operated systems capable of being joined together with populated data to form a single storage system. 

b.	 The storage system must be able to physically break apart into multiple independently operated sub-systems to reallocate storage as needed for any reasonable search request.

c.	The system must be capable of hosting a minimum of 40TB of data in a contiguous NTFS volume. And be expandable to a minimum of 66TB

d.	The storage solution must be capable of communicating with production server systems utilizing I-SCSI protocol and Microsoft ISCSI initiators.

e.	The storage solution must utilize interoperable SATA AND SAS disk technology that is compatible with data drives in use in the Secretary of Defense environment.

f.	The storage solution must minimize rack space by accommodating a minimum of 12 Disks of 750GB SATA drives per enclosure capable of being rack mounted within a standard 2 rack unit space. 

g.	The system must be fault-tolerant with dual power supplies, RAID redundancy and Hot-Spare disks.

h.	The system must support point-in-time snapshoting of data.

i.	The system needs to have  the following security features;  Kerberos Authentication v5, ACL Security for Users and Groups;  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit Encryption; CHAP Authentication (iSCSI target level) 

j.	The Vendor must be able to provide onsite support for the product line.


Based on these requirements, Adaptec provides the most appropriate storage system that meets all of the minimum requirements. The Adaptec SnapServer 520 series family of Network Attached Storage combined with the modular SanBloc Series 50 JBOD Disk enclosures is capable of multiple configurations with a dense 1U and 2U rack mountable form factor. The Snapserver NAS can support up to 9TB per enclosure with SATA disks. The Snap server uses a 64Bit AMD Opteron processor with Adaptec?s Guardian OS Software. The operating system includes advanced storage features such as snapshoting and expansion of live volumes using I.C.E for flexible storage. The operating system also provides a feature of native server to server replication that will preclude purchase of additional software to complete the search project. The snapserver has dual ported imbedded 1 gigabit NICs capable of fault tolerant configuration along with dual power supplies for each device allowing the hardware to be connected to redundant independent critical power circuits. Adaptec can provide the support services required for maintaining the equipment onsite without removing sensitive data external to the secure environment.  The Snapserver line supports the ISCSI protocols and initiators of production systems that would be integrated with it. 


Companies who can provide the above listed hardware must submit their quote not later than COB 14 June 2007 via the following address: TARA.WHITAKER@DISA.MIL. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order awarded to the lowest cost/technically acceptable quote. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered. The NAICS code is 423430 for this procurement.*****

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SATELLITE SERVICE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Answer the following questions. 1.  Is the 150 Hours each year or over the whole contract life? The 150 hour specification is rough, per year, originally based upon estimated need for satellite services for up to 4 one-week (5 day) deployments per year, using the satellite system for up to 7 hrs/day [4 deployments x 5 days/deployment x 7 hrs/day = approximately 140 to 150 hours required per year at a total.]  The intent  is to renew this capability yearly, thus the "occassional use" policy, as specified--the base year, plus 4, one-year options. 2.  Is the contract life until 2012? Yes, if we choose to exercise all options. 3.  Unit Price, is this for the whole contract or each year? You must break it out separately for the Base and for each Option Year. 4.  Is the estimated quantity of hours per year quantities?  Or over a 5 year contract term? See Item one's answer above. 5.  Based upon the FEC and the Viasat hub and modern equipment--how much satellite bandwidth is desired? Based on estimated requirements to provide 1.0 Mbps (1 Mbps = 1,048,576 bits-per-second) uplink data rate for communications from the 2.4Meter fixed dish to the 1.2Meter portable dish (duplex audio and data files only, no video), and 2.048 Mbps uplink data rate for communications from the 1.2Meter portable dish to the 2.4Meter fixed dish (duplex audio, data files, and video), bandwidth required is different depending on the origin/destination of data.  Max required bandwidth is approx. 2.05 Mbps. 6.  How much notice will NASA provide before wishing to go onto vendor provided satellite space segment? At least three weeks notice will be given. 7.  Can vendor provide satellite space segment on different domestic satellites? Yes, provided all other specifications are met. 8.  What is the geographic coverage area that you require? The 2.4m dish is fixed outside B1220 at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia.  For the next 2 years, the remote dish will be located at NASA Wallops Flight Facility, located near Chincoteague Island, Virginia on the Eastern Shore. Required geographic coverage for the next 5 years would likely be the US Eastern Standard Time zone. 9.  Please define the coverage area that you require. Required geographic coverage for the next 5 years would likely be the US Eastern Standard Time zone.  However, research requirements may dictate deployment to other sites in the continental United States. 10.  What is the area to be covered by the satellite service you are looking for? Required geographic coverage for the next 5 years would likely be the US Eastern Standard Time zone.  However, research requirements may dictate deployment to other sites in the continental United States. 11.  What is the location of the two dishes the satellite connectivity will serve? The NASA system is comprised of two antennas.  One antenna is a 2.4 meter satellite dish with 8 Watt Ku band block up converter, fixed at NASA Langley.	The second antenna is  a field deployable portable 1.2 meter dish with 25 Watt transmit power amplifier, 1Watt Ku band block up converter.  The 2.4m dish is fixed outside B1220 at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia.  The portable dish is transported to the flight test site.  For the next 2 years, the portable remote dish will be located at NASA Wallops Flight Facility, located near Chincoteague Island, Virginia on the Eastern Shore.

The usual freight from the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services is estimated to be up to thirty (30) locker type trunks, which weigh an estimated (75) pounds each or 2,250 pounds in total for usual heavy shipping days. The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice. The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight may be in sealed boxes. It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes and the use of equipment to load and unload will be necessary.  All equipment used for oversized/ overweight freight will be provided by the contractor at each OPM facility. Furthermore, changes due to technology may have an impact on the number of lockboxes or sealed boxes being shipped between OPM facilities in the near future.  OPM may seek an equable adjustment for reduction in material. The contractor shall have A DEDICATED VEHICLE (s) for these deliveries and shall not pickup/drop off other agencies or companies material while possessing and/or delivering OPM material.     


Replace paragraphs 1 and 2 with the following:

8. CONTRACTOR/DELIVERY DRIVER RESPONSIBILITIES: 
    
The contractor will provide drivers who will be responsible for loading and unloading at origin and destination and must be insured and bonded at the contractor s expense. The contractor delivery driver will be given no more than 30 minutes to unload and load from each facility for on time deliveries. 

The contractor s drivers will be issued appropriate picture identification.  Such identification must be in the driver s possession at all times when handling OPM lockboxes and sealed cardboard boxes.  Additionally, the picture identification must be worn on the employee s person, above the waist, and visible at all time when in a Government facility.

<DESC>PLEASE VISIT U.S. ARMY YUMA PROVING GROUND CONTRACTING OFFICE WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.YUMA.ARMY.MIL/SITE_CONTRACTING_RFQS.ASP FOR AN ALTERNATE/MORE LEGIBLE FORMAT OF THIS AMENDMENT ***CLOSING DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS IS EXTENDED TO  19 JUNE 2007 11:00 AM MST*** The deadline for submitting technical questions was 25 May 2007 and questions were received about both the Cargo Trailer and the Office Trailers.   The questions and answers regarding the Cargo Trailer are below.   Due to Government technical personnel bei ng temporarily unavailable, the amendment with the questions and answers regarding the Office Trailers will be issued the week of 04 June 2007.    As a result of the delay, the closing date for receipt of proposals is extended to 19 June 2007, 11:00 AM MST . Questions and Answers about Cargo Trailer: Q1:  We will be preparing an offer for your solicitation.  Could you please ask your customer for the following clarifications:  Are they sure they want (2) A/C units in the 14' trailer and only one in the larger units? A1.  Cargo trailer will need two A/C units. Should one fail, test personnel can still continue mission. Q2:  The specifications for the trailers have 24 inch spacing on the floor joists.  24 inch means a 4x8 sheet of plywood is only supported in the middle making for a soft floor.  Shall we stay at 24 inch or increase to 16 inch or 12 inch.  If the team plac es much cargo or even large personnel in the trailers, the flooring will flex. A2:  For the Cargo trailer, 24 inch or closer spacing on floor joists is acceptable.  Q3:  The specifications also call for 24 inch spacing on the sidewall posts which does not make for a very strong overall trailer.  With 24 inch sidewall spacing, the 3/8 inch plywood liner will also be soft.  Industry standard is 16 inch which is resident ial spacing. A3:  For the Cargo trailer, 24 inch or closer spacing on sidewall posts is acceptable. Q4:  The specifications also call for insulation comprised of bubble wrap.   A4:  For the Cargo trailer, the type insulation material may be different as long as it is present in the roof and sidewalls. Q5:   We also had a question on the specifications on the Cargo trailer. Would there be any resistance to using an ISO shipping container based system? A5:  For the Cargo trailer, an ISO shipping container based system is NOT an acceptable substitute.
