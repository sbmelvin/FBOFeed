<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for the following six items for its ruggedized research flight control computer (RFCC): a) One compact PCI form factor PPC 2041 based single board computer b) One cPCI multifunction I/O board with 24 channels of +/- 10V analog-to-digital input c) One cPCI multifunction I/O board with 20 channels of +/- 10V digital-to-analog output d) One cPCI multifunction I/O board with 32 channels of discrete input/output e) One cPCI multifunction I/O board with 2 channels dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B input/output f) One cPCI multifunction I/O board with 8 RS-232/422/485 ports <P> NASA ARC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from North Atlantic Industries (NAI), of Bohemia, NY, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. <P> NASA ARC previously purchased the system components listed above for use on a research helicopter.  This procurement will create a duplicate RFCC for use in a System Integration Laboratory (SIL) and that can be used as a backup in case the aircraft unit fails.	 <P> The units must be identical for two main reasons: <P> 1) Software development and testing will be performed in the SIL prior to transferring the new software to the aircraft.  To transfer the software directly from the SIL to the aircraft, both the SIL and the aircraft need to have the same hardware systems.  Even minor differences in hardware can require changes to the code. <P> 2) Should the system installed on the aircraft fail, the identical unit from the SIL can be installed in the aircraft.  With identical systems, the units can be swapped quickly, as it will not be necessary to modify the software or adjust wiring harnesses for different connectors on a different system. <P> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Organizations that believe they are capable of providing the described requirement may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00pm PT on January 27, 2015.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <P> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong>
<p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Suction Canister through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 1 March 2015. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Reusable and Disposable Suction Canisters, and suction canister liners, in various sizes, that are latex free or latex safe, with a defined shelf- life, and clear, readable gradient markings.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The subject QSL will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel.</p>
<p>To participate in the QSL process <strong>vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor.</strong> Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification</strong></span>. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo<br />at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.

<DESC>The solicitation is for the Naval Medical Research Unit Cambodia Operations Support Contract (NMRCOSC) within Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  The solicitation will be advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. The North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 561210 and the annual size standard is $35,500,000.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The anticipated operations services to be performed include, but are not limited to, Management and Administration, Command and Staff, Security Operations, Facility Support, and Utilities.

This is a new requirement. Currently this requirement is being satisfied by the US Embassy where NAMRU-II is sharing a facility with the US Embassy.
 However a new facility is needed for potential additional specialty freezers.

The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a twelve-month base period (to include a four-month mobilization/phase-in period), seven (7) 12-month option periods, with an integrated one-month demobilization/phase-out period. The Government will not issue a synopsis when exercising the option(s).  

Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at http://fbo.gov/ when it becomes available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation, which shall be considered.  

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.
  Award of a contract shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal provides a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. The Offerors price proposal including all option periods will be evaluated on completeness and price reasonableness. The anticipated technical evaluation factors are as follows:  (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical Approach/Methods; and (3) Staffing and Resources.  The Government intends to award the contract without discussions in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary to obtain the best value for the Government. 

The solicitation will be issued on or about 15 days from the date of this notice.
  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fbo.gov/ on or about 17 November 2014.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  Paper copies of the solicitation, amendments, drawings and maps will not be provided.  IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Once the RFP has been posted, all technical/contractual questions must be submitted in writing to:  NFPACQ23-Box1@navy.mil.  In the email, please clearly indicate your company name, section and paragraph number of the RFP or specification and the drawing number, as applicable.
  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Previously, offerors were required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and have an active registration in CCR prior to completing their Reps and Certs (Section K of the RFP) in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to award of a contract.  Offerors are now required to complete their registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database via the website https://www.sam.gov. If the offeror previously had an active CCR/ORCA account the offerors information has automatically been incorporated into the SAM database. Offerors are strongly recommended to review their information in SAM to be current and up to date.
 Failure to register in SAM makes an offeror ineligible for award of DoD contracts.  

A pre-proposal conference/site visit is projected to occur during the week of 14 December 2014 in Cambodia.  The exact dates and location of the pre-proposal conference/site visit will be provided in the RFP. Parties interested in attending the pre-proposal conference/site visit MUST PRE-REGISTER by submitting a request via email to NFPACQ23-Box1@navy.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on 18 November 2014.  Due to logistical considerations, a maximum of two (2) representatives will be allowed per firm. Attendees are responsible for their own travel arrangements.  Failure to submit all required information by 18 November 2014, at 4:00 p.m.
 HST will preclude a firms eligibility to participate in the pre-proposal conference and site visit. 

Each pre-proposal conference/site-visit request must include the following information: full name of attendee(s), name of firm represented by attendee(s) and, position/title, telephone number and e-mail address of attendee(s). Request needs to note if the representative will be attending the pre-proposal conference, site visit or both. The Government may request additional information for site visit attendees if required, which will be requested prior to pre-proposal conference/site-visit.  Additional information will be provided to the registered conference/site visit attendees.

The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice.
 This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose.

<DESC>Construction Project entitled Little Goose Digital Governor Upgrade.  This will be a firm fixed-price construction contract located at Little Goose Lock and Dam (Columbia County, Washington).  Estimated construction magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000; and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The period of performance is anticipated to be between 29 April 2015 and 11 March 2016. <br>  <br> Summary Scope of Work: <br>  <br> Digital governor upgrades are required on all six main hydropower units of Little Goose Hydroelectric Power Plant, located in Starbuck, WA.  Individual main unit capacity is 135 megawatts (MW) for a total powerhouse capacity of 810 MW.  All six main units are Kaplan type with adjustable turbine blades.   <br>  <br> There are two families of hydropower units at Little Goose powerhouse, both utilizing adjustable turbine blades.  Units 1 through 3 utilize mechanical actuator type governors manufactured by Pelton and were completed in 1970.  Units 4 through 6 utilize electrical analog actuator type governors manufactured by Woodward and were completed in 1978.  All six units have original governors with proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control for both the gate and blade servomotors.  The governors control unit speed by operating wicket gates through a combination of hydraulic, mechanical and electrical means.  The governors control blade pitch by adjusting blade angle through a combination of hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical means.  Unit 1 through 3 governor speed reference is generated by a permanent magnet generator (PMG) whereas unit 4 through 6 governor speed reference is generated by a speed signal generator (SSG). <br>  <br> Digital governor equipment has already been procured and shall be provided under this contract as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for contractor installation.  Installation plans and specifications contain prescriptive and performance requirements for the installation and testing of GFE digital governor equipment and include detailed wiring for Unit 2 and Unit 5. The contractor will perform the detailed wiring for Unit 1 and Unit 3 similar to Unit 2 and detailed wiring for Unit 4 and Unit 6 similar to Unit 5.  The Contractor will perform the removal of the existing governor components and the installation of the new GFE digital governors. <br>  <br> General Work <br>  <br> As part of the digital governor installation work, a front panel of the actuator cabinet will be removed and replaced with a new governor cabinet with a GFE Human Machine Interface (HMI).  An additional GFE HMI will be installed in the control room and will be capable of controlling all six units. <br>  <br> As part of the digital governor upgrade, the new digital governor controller will replace the hardwired relay logic for automatic unit start/stop sequencing.  The start sequence will bring the unit to speed-no-load, and the stop sequence will shutdown the unit after the breaker has been opened.  The governor will include automatic, semiautomatic, and manual starting.  <br>  <br> Upon completion of all demolition work within the governor actuator cabinets, the interior surfaces will be stripped and repainted. <br>  <br> Solicitation Number W912EF-15-R-0006 will be posted to the FBO website on or about January 28, 2015.  The solicitation will be a Request for Proposal using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable method.  Evaluation criteria will be contained in the solicitation.  Proposals will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.  The solicitation is unrestricted and open to both large and small business concerns.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Next Generation Closed Circuit Mine Escape Respirators (CCMER)."<br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the NAICS code 541712 for the potential acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Statement of Work:</span></strong><br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) leads the development of self-escape apparatus to provide breathing gas to mining personnel operating in various capacities underground in environments containing hazardous gas components; in the event of an emergency. This Request for Proposals is for the development and manufacture of NIOSH certified Next Generation Closed Circuit Mine Escape Respirators (CCMER) that could be used for surviving and escaping from a mine following an emergency that renders the mine atmosphere irrespirable.</p>
<p>Two types of self-escape apparatus are currently being developed by NIOSH-OMSHR through contracts with other government agencies and industry. These efforts would yield prototypes capable of providing up to one hour of breathable gas to an escaping miner during an emergency. One development project would result in a backpack style self-escape apparatus prototype termed Backpack SCSR (BSCSR) and another would result in a vest style self-escape apparatus prototype termed Closed-Circuit Escape Vest (CCEV). Both are closed-circuit (rebreather) designs using gaseous oxygen from gas cylinders and Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) CO2 absorbent sheets manufactured by Micropore Inc. The BSCSR has a mechanical oxygen control and the CCEV has an electronic oxygen control. Both units are to be designed according to the performance guidelines outlined in Part 84 of Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR Part 84) including Sub-part O NIOSH standard.</p>
<p>In separate development efforts, components for this type of self-escape breathing apparatus, namely Docking &amp; Switch-Over Valves (DSOVs), Hood/Masks (HMCs) and Very High Pressure Cylinders (VHPC) were developed through previous funded contracts with NIOSH-OMSHR. The DSOVs were developed to enable connection of two breathing apparatus (either two CCERs, also known as SCSRs or an SCSR to an Open Circuit Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, also known as SCBA) to allow a seamless transfer to breathing from one device to the other. Hoods with inner masks are expected to be easier to use than current SCSRs fitted with a mouthpiece, allowing natural breathing through the nose and mouth as opposed to breathing only through the mouth. They further eliminate the need to fit nose clips and goggles, thus simplifying the donning process. Hoods and masks also allow speech diaphragms to be incorporated, enabling the wearer to communicate verbally during escape, which is not possible in current SCSR designs. Very high pressure carbon composite oxygen cylinders allow a smaller and lighter oxygen supply container in an SCSR. Prototypes are now available to be integrated and tested on functional breathing apparatus.</p>
<p>Outputs from these development projects would form the basis for the Dockable Self-Contained (Closed Circuit) Self-Escape Respirators with Hoods (CCMER).</p>
<p>2. NEXT GENERATION CLOSED CIRCUIT MINE ESCAPE RESPIRATORS (CCMER)</p>
<p>CCMERs need to be designed so that they could be worn comfortably and continuously by miners during their daily work routine and function as an escape breathing apparatus in the event of an emergency. The proposed CCMER should be designed and manufactured as a closed-circuit oxygen rebreather, whereby the user breathes the same gas in a closed loop similar to the current developments underway by NIOSH-OMSHR e.g. backpack and vest style SCSRs. Exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) is to be absorbed by a scrubber system and oxygen addition is according to the user's needs. The oxygen addition may either be manually or electronically controlled. The successful CCMER design must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O for mine use and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations for use in underground mines. The design/s must be jointly certified by both NIOSH and MSHA. The capacity of the units should be cap 2 and 3 as defined in sub-part O to meet mining requirements. The CCMER must incorporate docking &amp; switch-over valves (DSOV) for seamless transfer from one breathing device to another and hood with inner masks &amp; speech diaphragm (HMC) for ease of donning, use and communication ability. Due consideration should be given in the design to result in a small package which can either be donned separately, or integrated into a miner's ensemble. Due to the necessity of its regular use by the miner while underground, the CCMER can be designed to incorporate many of the tool-holders/pockets/ attachment points currently utilized by miners in their day-to-day work environment. Features such as mini-gauges for determining oxygen cylinder pressure and indicators for the CO2 scrubber monitoring during routine maintenance/inspection should be incorporated. A quick-connect oxygen supply line would be is needed to provide recharging of the oxygen cylinder. As the CCMER is to be continually worn by the miner while underground, and readily accessible for deployment when needed, and it must be designed with human factors considerations.</p>
<p>Two versions of the CCMER are possible:</p>
<p>2.1. CCMER - V (Vest Style DSCSR)<br />The CCMER - V may be based on the CCEV and need to incorporate a DSOV and HMC. It must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O for mine use and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations.</p>
<p>2.2. CCMER - B (Backpack Style DSCSR)<br />The CCMER - B may be based on the BSCSR and need to incorporate a DSOV and HMC. It must be certified to 42CFR84 standards including Sub-part O and must meet MSHA 30CFR75 and 30CFR18 permissibility regulations.</p>
<p>Contractor is responsible for gaining certification from the respective approval bodies for the final saleable production CCMER</p>
<p>3. PROTOTYPES UNDER DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>3.1. Backpack SCSR (BSCSR) Prototype<br />The miner's backpack SCSR is comprised of an ergonomically designed harness system with the backpack SCSR module positioned in the area of the small of the back. The backpack SCSR is designed as a closed-circuit rebreather using a mechanical controlled oxygen delivery system to maintain the required oxygen level in the breathing loop. The belt portion of the harness has features found on a miner's belt.</p>
<p>3.2. Closed-Circuit Escape Vest (CCEV) Prototype<br />The miner's CCEV design is a fully closed-circuit rebreather that integrates the CO2 scrubber into a conformal shape inside a vest form. It uses an oxygen sensor for monitoring the loop oxygen level and an electronic oxygen control system, whereby oxygen is added automatically into the breathing loop via an electro-mechanical solenoid valve at a rate that matches the metabolic consumption of the wearer. A miner's belt is an integral part of the CCEV.</p>

<DESC>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system to support quantum Hall research in the Physical Measurement Laboratory. The system will be situated within the Fundamental Electrical Measurements Group (FEM) as a resource accessible to NIST researchers and to outside users via collaboration to measure a wide range of physical properties of quantum Hall devices. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications further developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order for a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

Measuring the properties of new quantum Hall devices is a critical part of the FEM mission.  A versatile, sensitive, and easy to use cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system is required to characterize such new devices.  To fulfill this requirement, NIST plans to purchase a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system that has the capability to provide automated measurements of magneto-transport over a range of low temperatures and large magnetic fields.  The measurement system shall meet the following minimum requirements:

GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

1.	Cryogen-free: The Government requires a system in which liquid helium is not needed.  A system that requires the use of liquid helium will not be accepted.   A system requiring liquid nitrogen is acceptable. The minimum acceptable period of time between liquid nitrogen replenishment is 7 days;

2.	Cooling Power: Minimum cooling power 400 W at 0.1 K.


3.	Dilution refrigerator operational with and without magnet.

4.	Cool-down and warm-up times without magnet (between room temperature and base):  The maximum acceptable time is 30 hours for both. 

5.	Cool-down and warm-up times with magnet (between room temperature and base):  The maximum acceptable time is 70 hours for both. 

6.	Base temperature: The maximum acceptable temperature is 12 mK with magnet at full field and all leads connected to mixing chamber (see below)

7.	Sample space and Magnet: A sample space within a minimum 14 Tesla superconducting magnet will be provided.  As part of the requirement of a cryogen-free system, the superconducting magnet must be cryogen-free. The sample space must have a minimum diameter of 40 mm and a maximum acceptable magnetic field inhomogeneity of 0.1% within a 10 mm diameter spherical volume.

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:
8.	Low-frequency leads:
a.	At least 72 low-frequency leads, running between the top plate and the mixing chamber, in twisted pairs (36 twisted pairs total) shall be provided.  All leads shall be low-ohmic with copper leads from the top plate to the plate near 3 K and superconducting lead from the plate near 3 K to the mixing chamber. Total resistance for each lead from the top plate to the mixing chamber with system at base temperature shall be less than 2 ohms.  There will be an electrostatic shield between these leads and all diagnostic (thermometer and heater) wiring.  The leads shall be connected at the plate near 3 K and at the still plate, as well as at the top plate and the mixing chamber; the electrostatic shields must be electrically continuous from room temperature down to the mixing chamber.
b.	Wiring for one extra thermometer. Thermally-anchored wiring for a standard commercial four-lead ruthenium oxide thermometer shall be provided, satisfying the following:
i.	The wiring shall terminate below the mixing chamber.
ii.	If a single commercial temperature controller to read other thermometers in various locations is used, a separate channel in this temperature controller shall be provided that shall be connected to the four-lead wiring provided for our use.

9.	System Size:  The Government requires a system that is as short (distance between top plate and floor) as possible.  This requirement is important given that, if possible, operation without the need of personnel climbing on ladders is advantageous.  The maximum acceptable distance is 3 m.

10.	Ease of Use:  The Government requires a system which can be operated from open to closed to base temperature to room temperature to open by only one person (as opposed to requiring two or more people to operate some or all of the cycle).

11.	Sound isolation box: The government wishes to reduce the noise coming from the pulse tube refrigerator (PTR) through the top plate of the cryostat.  For this reason, the contractor shall provide panels with sound-deadening acoustical foam on all six sides surrounding the top plate (above, below, and all four sides).

12.	Pulse Tube Refrigerator Compressor Location:  A system in which the compressor for the pulse tube refrigerator can be located in a separate room shall be provided.  The minimum acceptable distance between the compressor and the system is 10 m.

13.	Vibration:  The maximum acceptable amplitude of vibrations is 10 m at the mixing chamber plate. 

14.	System Mechanical Support:  A standard floor-based support system shall be provided.  To avoid possible additional electrical noise in the system, the top plate and metal pieces inside the cryostat will be electrically isolated from the support system.  The minimum electrical resistance between the top plate and the support system shall be 1 &#61517;&#61527;&#61486;

15.	Computer: A system that can be controlled by a Government-supplied laboratory computer shall be provided.  All necessary software shall be installed and demonstrated on the Government-supplied laboratory computer. In order to minimize electrical noise, the Government intends to use commercially-available fiber extenders for any communications ports such as GPIB, USB, and/or LAN.  The system must be compatible which such optical isolation.

16.	Manual/Stand-by Operation:  All valves must be able to be operated by manual switches, separate from any computer operation; ``computer operation" specifically excludes any electronic touch-screen-actuated switches.  Switches that are acceptable include mechanical, electrical (not controlled by digital electronics), and pneumatic.

17.	Compressor for Return Line:  If the high-pressure 3He return line has a compressor in it, valving shall be provided that makes it possible to bypass the compressor after the cool-down period, when the refrigerator is operating in its nominal condition at base temperature.

18.	Preventive Maintenance:  The minimum acceptable time between required preventive maintenance by the Government is two months.  Such maintenance includes pump maintenance, compressor maintenance, changing pump oil, or any other standard maintenance required to keep equipment running in accordance with the original equipment manufacturers performance specifications.

19.	Gaskets:  Duplicates of all gaskets needed on the various vacuum components shall be provided

20.	Extra low-frequency connectors:  At least six of every type of cable and bulkhead mount connector necessary for government personnel to make electrical contact to the government's samples shall be provided.

21.	Infrastructure requirements:  a system which requires no more than the following maximum requirements on infrastructure shall be provided:
a.	Area: total footprint of all equipment 18 m2
b.	Electrical power: maximum 50 A at each of 110/208/220/240 V.  No voltages above 240 V.
c.	Cooling water: maximum flow 30 liters/minute
d.	Pneumatic (pressurized air or nitrogen gas) service: maximum 10 bar.

22.	Location of turbo molecular pump:  For reduction of both mechanical and electrical noise, the turbo molecular pump shall not be located at the top of the refrigerator, but instead in a remote location such as the gas handling system.

23.	Past performance:

a.	The vendor shall have prior experience designing, constructing, and installing cryogen-free dilution refrigerator systems similar to that described in this sources sought notice, and be able to provide the names and contact information for at least 3 customer references.

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE:</strong><br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334118 - COMPUTER TERMINAL AND OTHER COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING - and the associated small business size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background Information:</strong> <br />The Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) helps the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) security group organize, distribute, manage, and report network security information to multiple users, NIH security organizations, and to articulate the detected and directed activity to executive NIMH management. This system has many powerful features that include: compliance reporting, asset management, real time aggregation of IDS/IPS events tracking the network security mediation process and organizational view of network security. The IDS/IPS is necessary to complement the NIMH Security Center software to augment the NIMH vulnerability remediation, audit, incident response, forensic analysis, and certification and accreditation functions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Information Resource Technology and Management Branch (IRTMB) HQ security staff has determined that the current IDS/IPS needs to be upgraded<br /> <br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition:</strong><br />The current Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) is a government required, network security appliance that incorporates the most detailed, up-to-date threat and vulnerability information to reduce time to resolve incidents and protect NIMH networks through enhanced risk prevention and security management capability. This system needs to be upgraded to 10Gbps throughput because CIT is upgrading the NIMH network from 1Gbps to 10Gbps to maintain compliance.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.<br /><br />Sources are sought for the economic viability, and capability and availability of potential parties interested in public-private partnerships for dredging and sediment management within the Great Lakes region. Great Lakes harbors and channels support the country as the 4th largest economic zone in North America. Maritime transportation infrastructure in the scope of this notice includes federally authorized, high use, commercial harbors as well as low use, commercial and recreational harbors; which provide the foundation for billions of dollars of revenue regionally. Industry, manufacturers, shippers and consumers need reliable and well maintained waterways on the Great Lakes. <br /><br />The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has the responsibility to operate and maintain 140 federally authorized harbors and channels on the Great Lakes (see attachments and hyperlinks for listings of federal project locations, project overviews and hydrographic and condition surveys ; and, the Great Lakes System Navigation Projects and Harbors). In addition, USACE operates 20 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) (see attachment for list of Active CDFs in the Great Lakes Region). We are seeking fiscally economical means to fully maintain the maritime navigation system to authorized dimensions; particularly, the low use commercial and recreational harbors. Further, some of the commercial harbors are running out of CDF capacity for dredged material in cases where beneficial use, near-shore placement or open water placement is not feasible. Extending the life of these CDFs will enhance the ability to maintain the maritime navigation system. In the past, dredged material has been considered a waste product; however, dredged material is a valuable resource with many beneficial uses as evidenced by recent innovative applications. <br /><br />USACE is seeking interested parties to generate ideas and/or participate in public-private partnerships to better maintain Great Lakes navigable waterways in a long-term sustainable manner with reliable public and/or private investment. Improving navigation maintenance throughout the Great Lakes requires dredging of federally authorized channels as well as providing safe, appropriately engineered and environmentally sound methods of placement of dredged sediment. Specifically, USACE is seeking responses to ascertain interest and feasibility of exploring a host of solutions to the following three (3) challenges: <br /><br />&bull;Dredging maintains navigation channels, harbors and ports that are critical to the economic and cultural viability of communities within the Great Lakes region; however, there is a growing backlog of maintenance dredging within the Great Lakes region. <br /><br />&bull;Dredged material is generally treated as a waste product; which may be used as a valuable resource with many potential benefits.<br /><br />&bull;USACE is currently responsible for the operation of 20 Confined Disposal Facilities (CDFs) in the Great Lakes region. CDFs' capacities are steadily decreasing and will eventually become unusable as an alternative for disposal of dredged material. The cost to create new CDFs for disposal of dredged material is high. Extending the operational life of the existing system and facilities could potentially be more cost effective, and filled CDFs may also have potential uses.<br /><br />USACE is particularly interested in projects that can be executed under current federal and state laws and policies.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for informational, collaborative and planning purposes.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.
<p>Sources are sought for the economic viability, and capability and availability of potential parties interested in public-private partnerships for dredging and sediment management within the Great Lakes region. Great Lakes harbors and channels support the country as the 4th largest economic zone in North America. Maritime transportation infrastructure in the scope of this notice includes federally authorized, high use, commercial harbors as well as low use, commercial and recreational harbors; which provide the foundation for billions of dollars of revenue regionally. Industry, manufacturers, shippers and consumers need reliable and well maintained waterways on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has the responsibility to operate and maintain 140 federally authorized harbors and channels on the Great Lakes (see attachments and hyperlinks for listings of federal project locations, project overviews and hydrographic and condition surveys ; and, the Great Lakes System Navigation Projects and Harbors). In addition, USACE operates 20 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) (see attachment for list of Active CDFs in the Great Lakes Region). We are seeking fiscally economical means to fully maintain the maritime navigation system to authorized dimensions; particularly, the low use commercial and recreational harbors. Further, some of the commercial harbors are running out of CDF capacity for dredged material in cases where beneficial use, near-shore placement or open water placement is not feasible. Extending the life of these CDFs will enhance the ability to maintain the maritime navigation system. In the past, dredged material has been considered a waste product; however, dredged material is a valuable resource with many beneficial uses as evidenced by recent innovative applications.</p>
<p>USACE is seeking interested parties to generate ideas and/or participate in public-private partnerships to better maintain Great Lakes navigable waterways in a long-term sustainable manner with reliable public and/or private investment. Improving navigation maintenance throughout the Great Lakes requires dredging of federally authorized channels as well as providing safe, appropriately engineered and environmentally sound methods of placement of dredged sediment. Specifically, USACE is seeking responses to ascertain interest and feasibility of exploring a host of solutions to the following three (3) challenges:</p>
<p>&bull;Dredging maintains navigation channels, harbors and ports that are critical to the economic and cultural viability of communities within the Great Lakes region; however, there is a growing backlog of maintenance dredging within the Great Lakes region.<br /><br />&bull;Dredged material is generally treated as a waste product; which may be used as a valuable resource with many potential benefits.<br /><br />&bull;USACE is currently responsible for the operation of 20 Confined Disposal Facilities (CDFs) in the Great Lakes region. CDFs' capacities are steadily decreasing and will eventually become unusable as an alternative for disposal of dredged material. The cost to create new CDFs for disposal of dredged material is high. Extending the operational life of the existing system and facilities could potentially be more cost effective, and filled CDFs may also have potential uses.<br /><br />USACE is particularly interested in projects that can be executed under current federal and state laws and policies.</p>

<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has the responsibility to operate and maintain 140 federally authorized harbors and channels on the Great Lakes (see attachments and hyperlinks for listings of federal project locations, project overviews and hydrographic and condition surveys ; and, the Great Lakes System Navigation Projects and Harbors). In addition, USACE operates 20 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) (see attachment for list of Active CDFs in the Great Lakes Region). We are seeking fiscally economical means to fully maintain the maritime navigation system to authorized dimensions; particularly, the low use commercial and recreational harbors. Further, some of the commercial harbors are running out of CDF capacity for dredged material in cases where beneficial use, near-shore placement or open water placement is not feasible. Extending the life of these CDFs will enhance the ability to maintain the maritime navigation system. In the past, dredged material has been considered a waste product; however, dredged material is a valuable resource with many beneficial uses as evidenced by recent innovative applications.</p>
<p>USACE is seeking interested parties to generate ideas and/or participate in public-private partnerships to better maintain Great Lakes navigable waterways in a long-term sustainable manner with reliable public and/or private investment. Improving navigation maintenance throughout the Great Lakes requires dredging of federally authorized channels as well as providing safe, appropriately engineered and environmentally sound methods of placement of dredged sediment. Specifically, USACE is seeking responses to ascertain interest and feasibility of exploring a host of solutions to the following three (3) challenges:</p>
<p>&bull;Dredging maintains navigation channels, harbors and ports that are critical to the economic and cultural viability of communities within the Great Lakes region; however, there is a growing backlog of maintenance dredging within the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>&bull;Dredged material is generally treated as a waste product; which may be used as a valuable resource with many potential benefits.</p>
<p>&bull;USACE is currently responsible for the operation of 20 Confined Disposal Facilities (CDFs) in the Great Lakes region. CDFs' capacities are steadily decreasing and will eventually become unusable as an alternative for disposal of dredged material. The cost to create new CDFs for disposal of dredged material is high. Extending the operational life of the existing system and facilities could potentially be more cost effective, and filled CDFs may also have potential uses.<br /><br />USACE is particularly interested in projects that can be executed under current federal and state laws and policies.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
INTRODUCTION:

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS/RFI) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Although "proposal" and/or "Offeror" may be used in this SS/RFI, any response will be treated as information only.

REQUIREMENT:

The VHA, PCAC is in the process of planning a procurement in which a contractor will be required to provide non-personal services to support Terminology Standards for the Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA). The contractor shall conduct, coordinate, and collaborate on terminology standards activities within and beyond VA including knowledge management, creating, organizing, integrating, maintaining and harmonizing perpetually licensed or open source healthcare terminologies. The purpose is to enable computational capability, and to contribute to a framework that provides cognitive and decision support for Veteran's health, research, quality improvement, public health, and long range planning activities (see ATTACHMENT 2). 

The Government anticipates soliciting a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), single award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of 12 months with four (4) one (1) year option periods.

It is anticipated that the IDIQ contract will include a combination of general requirements that will be further defined in individual task orders and detailed requirements at fixed, unit prices to facilitate the ordering process. Overall, requirements may fall within one specific functional area in the draft PWS but in many cases, the requirements will encompass and apply across multiple functional areas to provide the total terminology lifecycle solution.  

PURPOSE:

The VA is conducting market research and is seeking written responses with information to assist the Government with identifying potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described in the draft PWS. The Government is also seeking to obtain industry comments and questions regarding the draft PWS.

DISCLAIMER:

This SS/RFI notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Government. Per FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this notice. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents; however, the Government does reserve the right to contact any respondent and/or respondent reference to obtain additional information. At this time no solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Lead Accreditations. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 813920: Professional Organizations. Business size standard for NAICS 813920 is $15,000,000.00. <br /><br />The proposed source is American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), 3141 Fairview Park Dr Ste 777, Falls Church, VA, 22042. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, 14 Jan 2015, 1200 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires AIHA to provide Industrial Hygiene accreditation and Environmental Lead accreditation because AIHA is the only known source that provides the required accreditations. The government requires on-site analytical testing of the Occupational and Environmental Analytical Services (OEHTA) laboratory. Laboratories performing industrial hygiene sample analysis are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be accredited by an appropriate accreditation body certified by EPA. The testing includes the following:</p>
<p>1. Industrial Hygiene Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />2. Environmental Lead Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />3. Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) to include Paint Samples, Soil Samples, and Dust Samples.<br />4. Industrial Hygiene Proficiency Analytical Testing (IHPAT) to include Metals Samples, Organic Samples, and Diffusive 3M Samplers.</p>
<p>Biennial Accreditation:<br />6. ELLAPANN - Accreditation Program, Environmental Lead<br />7. IHLAPANN - Accreditation Program, Industrial Hygiene</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to daniel.bresnahan.1@us.af.mil no later than Wednesday, 14 Jan 2015, 1200 EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Lead Accreditations". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The required service to investigate, evaluate, identify<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the causes of the malfunction and provide detailed recommendations to cure the ineffective Small Arms Indoor Firing Range ventilation system are only reasonably available from one single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). An urgent and compelling need exists to resolve the inadequate Small Arms Firing Range ventilation system. This facility is used to train and certify March Air Reserve Base and Los Angeles Air Force Base security forces, but has yet to be utilized solely due to the ineffective ventilation. Repeated attempts to effectively repair the ventilation system have failed. Time is of the essence due to the noted increase in terrorism and international events. Market research was conducted which revealed only one business, Carey's Heating &amp; Air Conditioning was found with this type of requisite experience in the specialized ventilation system of small arms indoor firing ranges within the required timeframe.</p>

<CONTACT>Marc Manheimer, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-15-02@iarpa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Electronic Design Automation tools for Superconducting Electronics<br /><br />Synopsis<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) seeks information on the availability and development of electronic design automation (EDA) tools for superconducting electronics (SCE). This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals.  The following sections of this RFI define the overall scope of the technical domain of interest, along with instructions for the preparation and submission of responses. <br /><br />Background &amp; Scope<br />To reach its goal of building a prototype superconducting computer, IARPA's Cryogenic Computing Complexity (C3) program will need to produce superconducting circuits of unprecedented density and complexity [1, 2]. The C3 program will be fabricating circuits using the 10-metal layer, fully planarized process at Lincoln Laboratory [3, 4]. The sophistication of today's complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits owes much to a rich set of EDA tools. Superconducting electronic circuit design has unique requirements imposed by superconductivity that prevent repurposing all of the same EDA toolchain used for CMOS design and that require the development of additional tools. The existing EDA toolchain for SCE is currently incomplete and limited in capability [2, 5, 6]. IARPA is interested in learning the best path towards eliminating these deficiencies. Responses should focus primarily but not exclusively on applicability to the IARPA C3 program.<br /><br />IARPA's short-term goal is to significantly reduce design time, increase the reliability of designs, and enable the design of complex digital circuits with at least 1,000,000 Josephson junctions. The longer-term IARPA goal is to develop a fully integrated EDA toolchain for superconducting digital, analog and hybrid circuits, and bridge the gap between superconducting and CMOS design.<br /><br />Questions:<br />&bull;	What relevant tools currently exist? What are the opportunities, challenges and limitations associated with adapting CMOS tools for superconducting use? What resources are required?<br />&bull;	Are there aspects of the CMOS development infrastructure other than tools that are important to the maturation of superconducting electronics design?<br />&bull;	What types of tools would be the most effective reducers of design time? What tools would provide the greatest reductions in design risk? Include estimates, if available.<br />&bull;	Are special tools needed for particular types of superconducting electronic circuits (e.g., RSFQ, RQL, analog, hybrid)? What tools are unique to superconducting circuits?
<p><br />Desirable features:<br />&bull;	Applicable to all families of single flux quantum (SFQ) digital logic<br />&bull;	Work to clock speeds of 100 GHz or greater<br />&bull;	Compatible with an existing CMOS tool chain<br />&bull;	Able to optimize a design based on metrics such as circuit area, power, energy per operation, or speed</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues and obstacles, describe how the approach may address those issues and obstacles and comment on the expected performance and robustness of the proposed approach. If appropriate, respondents may also choose to provide a non-proprietary rough order of magnitude (ROM) regarding what such approaches might require in terms of funding and other resources for one or more years. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.<br />IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.</p>
<p>Responses have the following formatting requirements:<br />1.	A one-page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-15-02; <br />2.	A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary; <br />3.	Responses to the five questions (limited to 6 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins);<br />4.	A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5.	Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions to Respondents<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 p.m., Local Time, College Park, MD on Friday, February 13, 2015. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-15-02@iarpa.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-15-02@iarpa.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimers and Important Notes<br />This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.<br />The responses to this RFI may be used to help in the identification of promising areas for investment through vehicles such as programs or small studies, as well as in the planning of an agenda and participant list for a potential workshop on EDA tools for superconducting electronics. If appropriate, a separate workshop announcement may be posted at a later date with additional details.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the information owner.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts nor information should be included in the submittal. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase to ASTM International
Posted Date: January 12th, 2015
Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division 
Response Date: January 26th, 2015, 5:00pm EST
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to ASTM International. ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of international voluntary consensus standards. Today, some 12,000 ASTM standards are used around the world to improve product quality, enhance safety, facilitate market access and trade, and build consumer confidence. ASTM will provide service to an on-line subscription to the complete book of ASTM standards.
The Agency has procured this electronic subscription for multiple years to provide Agency users with access on their desktop.  The service provides Agency scientist and technical staff with essential information for scientific evaluation and research. Failure to extend this task order would disrupt EPA's ability to respond in an effective and timely manner to the research needs of the Agency for policy and scientific decision making. This procurement is consistent with the Agency?s top seven priorities to protect human health and safeguard the natural environment. ASTM International is the sole provider of the ASTM Standards. Selecting a publisher or distributor other than ASTM International would not be possible.  ASTM International is the publisher and the only source that can deliver the electronic version.  At this time, ASTM International has not released the rights for the electronic submission of their information standards to any other publisher or distributor.
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services satisfy the Agency's requirements. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing.
The point of contact for this requirement is Andrew Howe, Contracting Officer, at howe.andrew@epa.gov.

PST. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or email usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil

(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>The anticipated award will be a FFP contract based upon the LPTA quote which is most advantageous for the USG.  Any use of any products or manufacturer named "ABZ" is not an endorsement or preference for ABZ products.  Rather, it is being used to assist the selling community to illustrate the USG's need and it identifies the name brand product which will satisfy this need; however, an equal to ABZ will be accepted if those products equal the specifications of ABZ products and fulfill the USG?s need. <BR> <BR>

<p>Technical Quote Instructions</p>
<p>To facilitate the technical quote evaluation, the offeror shall submit as part of the RFQ, a separate enclosure entitles, "Technical Quote." The data and information should be keyed to each paragraph of the Technical Quote requirements as outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach<br />2. Personnel<br />3. Organizational Experience <br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>Award Criteria</p>
<p>The technical factors when combined are significantly more important than the price factor. However, if two or more proposals are approximately technically equal then price becomes more important.</p>
<p>In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government, price, and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Selection of Offerors</p>
<p>1. The acceptability or unacceptability of the technical quote will be based upon a technical evaluation. Each quote will be evaluated in strict conformity with the RFQ, utilizing point scores and written critiques.</p>
<p>2. The Government reserves the right to make an award without further discussion of the quotes received. Therefore, it is important that your quote be submitted initially on the most favorable terms from both the technical and cost standpoints.</p>
<p>3. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award as a result of this RFQ. In addition, the RFQ may be amended if determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria Weights</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The following criteria are those that will be applied in the evaluation of your technical quote. The proposal will be evaluated using the following criteria and weights.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria Points<br />a. Technical Approach 45<br />b. Personnel 40<br />c. Organizational Experience 10<br />d. Past Performance 5</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria<br />Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program Reconsideration Panel<br />Life Care Planner <br />Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)</p>
<p>I. Technical Approach (45 points)</p>
<p>The proposed technical approach shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). It shall contain the following:</p>
<p>a. The Offeror shall explain, in its own words, its understanding of the requirements in detail.</p>
<p>b. The Offeror's proposal shall be written in a comprehensive, uniform, and grammatically accurate manner.</p>
<p>c. The Offeror shall fully describe the proposed technical approach to meet each of the tasks, and respective subtasks in the SOW. The technical approach should include a discussion of anticipated major problem areas and potential approaches for their solution.</p>
<p>II. Personnel (40 points)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall indicate the names, educational preparation, number of years of experience, and types of professional experience of contractor personnel that will be working on this contract. Resumes for all personnel must be submitted and shall indicate the labor categories/positions that persons within the organization will occupy for this project along with their key functions. The Offeror should delineate the staff's competence and demonstrated experience in the skills necessary for the requirements in this SOW.</p>
<p>Contractor staff performing on this contract must have a current certification as either a Certified Life Care Planner (CLCP) or a Certified Nurse Life Care Planner (CNLCP) and evidence of two (2) years' life care planning or review of life care plan experience within the past 5 years. The Offeror shall submit a project work plan, time schedule, and person loading matrix, including all work to be performed and deliverables.</p>
<p>III. Organizational Experience (10 Points)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall demonstrate the organization's experience in successfully managing contracts involving life care planning services or the review of life care plans. The Offeror must demonstrate a minimum of two (2) years' experience within the past 5 years.</p>
<p>IV. Past Performance (5)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall be responsible for requesting three (3) written professional references to submit to the Contract Specialist. The contractor shall not submit more than three (3) references. The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated in conjunction with the technical review. The overall total score for the past performance rating for each Offeror will be determined by calculating the average of the surveys received. The overall total score will be rounded to the nearest whole number to assign an appropriate adjectival rating (0 = Unsatisfactory, 1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent, 5 = Outstanding). The elements being rated are as follows:</p>
<p>Quality of Product or Service</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory- Non-conformances is jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.<br /><br />Poor - Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.<br /><br />Fair - Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.<br /><br />Good - There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.<br /><br />Excellent - There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.<br /><br />Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p>Cost Control</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory - Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor - Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair - Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good - There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent - There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p>Timeliness of Performance</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory-Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor-Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair-Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good-There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent-There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.</p>
<p>Outstanding-The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p>Business Relations</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.<br />Poor - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.<br /><br />Fair-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.<br /><br />Good-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.<br /><br />Excellent-Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.<br /><br />Outstanding-The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The merits of the proposal will be evaluated carefully. The technical factors are significantly more important than price. The following criteria and assigned weight for each criterion will be applied in the evaluation of your Technical Proposal:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria Points<br />a. Technical Approach 45<br />b. Personnel 40<br />c. Organizational Experience 10<br />d. Past Performance 5<br />Total 100</p>
<p>Price proposal will be evaluated for total price and reasonableness of the requirements. <br /><br />1. Reasonableness. Normally, competition establishes price reasonableness. In limited situations, additional analysis will be required by the Government to determine reasonableness. If, after receipt of a proposal, the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition does not exist for the efforts and a determination is made that none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1(b) apply, the Offeror shall be required to provide data other than certified cost and pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-3.</p>
<p>Administrative information submitted will be evaluated for completeness.</p>

<p>Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications materials.</p>
<p>11. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12</p>
<p>To perform the work specified herein the contractor personnel may require access to sensitive data, regular access to HHS-controlled facilities and/or access to HHS information systems, the Government may require that this effort entail a sensitivity level 5 (Public Trust) background investigation.*</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the Government's notification of applicable Suitability Background Investigation required, the contractor shall complete and submit required forms within 30 days of the notification. Additional submission instructions can be found at the NCI Information Technology Security Policies, Background Investigation Process: (http://ais.nci.nih.gov/).</p>

<p>Contractors should ensure that the employees whose names they submit have a reasonable chance for approval. While delays in performance caused by successful investigations will be the Government's responsibility, delays associated with rejections will be the contractor's responsibility.</p>
<p>Typically, the Government conducts investigations and checks at no cost to the contractor. Multiple investigations for the same position, whether- resulting from rejections or resulting from an employee's move to another position(s) or company, may at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reductions(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation.</p>
<p>* A level 5 is a Public Trust position, which requires a higher level background investigation, including personal interviews, credit checks, etc. Level 5 positions would require access to IT systems with sensitive data including all of the OIT contractors, and/or access to pre-decisional grant information, etc.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active."</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of<br />U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br /><br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action<br />is precluded. (ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.<br />&sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.<br />&sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with<br />the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-<br />4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). [_] TIN: .<br /><br />[_] TIN has been applied for.</p>
<p>[_] TIN is not required because:</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart<br />4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and<br />Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p><br />(c)</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart<br />42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br /><br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct<br />these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br /><br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT<br />PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU,<br />Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);<br /><br />(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and<br />"Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the<br /><br />WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.<br />This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

At a minimum, offers must show -- (1) The solicitation number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

<p>1) Technical Acceptability: IAW paragraph 6 of the SOW, the offeror is required to submit a detailed plan outlining the execution of the project from start to finish and final acceptance. The plan will be evaluated for feasibility, timeliness, and compliance with best industry standards for this type of effort. However, a plan that appears to reiterate the requirements of the SOW, without demonstrating a clear understanding of the work required, will be determined technically unacceptable. <strong>The plan must be submitted with the quote. Plans not included with the quote may render the entire submission unacceptable and excluded from further award consideration. </strong></p>
<p>2) Price: Offerors shall propose on all items. Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. Any offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will NOT be accepted. Quotes determined to be unreasonable, imbalanced or incompatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will NOT be considered. Submit pricing on the attached Schedule of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>b) The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if the lowest priced offeror does not demonstrate the technical capability and past performance to complete the requirement. The Government also intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items with Alt I. An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

For people to move, they have to use airlines and airports. Moving Algerians to Morocco to meet this solicitation requirements will be a challenge.<br />There is a community of Algerian people working on the Moroccan side of the boarder (Oujda / Saidia area), but <br />&bull;	They are not officially working in Morocco,<br />&bull;	They cross illegally the boarder, <br />&bull;	They are mainly lower class people,<br />&bull;	They are mainly adult men,<br />&bull;	They could be reluctant to participate to a meeting like a focus group.<br />Would the government be open to have in depth interviews with the Algerian community in Oujda (Saidia area) or conduct phone interviews for Algerians from Morocco?
<p><strong>*Answer#1:*<br /></strong></p>
BBG does not expect the contractor to move Algerians to Morocco to meet this solicitation requirement.

Proposals that recruit Algerians in Oujda based on the following criteria: Respondents in Oujda do not have to be Algerians or individuals who spend at least half of the year in Algeria.  Instead, respondents in Oujda can be individuals who 1) watch Algerian TV for news at least several times a week, either with a TV set or online via computer or cell phone.  <br /><br />All other criteria for choosing respondents including interest in politics, age, gender, past week viewership of current affairs TV program, use of the internet for information on current affairs, remain.  <br />Offerors are reminded as indicated in the Statement of Work, social class is not a criterion for selecting participants.  <br /><strong><br />************************* End Amend 02 ************************<br /></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Amend 01 (1/9/2015):&nbsp;</strong></span> This solicitation is hereby amended to extend the Deadline for submitting proposals to Jan 20, 2015.&nbsp; Questions and Answers will be posted via another Amendment to this solicitation on the FBO website.<br /><br /><strong>************************* End Amend 01 ************************<br /><br /></strong>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<DESC>Subpart 49.5-Contract Termination Clauses apply to this requirement.<br /><br />Answers to Vendor's Questions<br /><br />There does not appear to be technical specifications which enable us to provide a hardware configuration which meets NLM performance requirements and is comparable with competitive bids. By way of example below are listed several technical requirements which would enable us to properly configuration the technical environment and provide a meaningful price quotation: <br /><br />1. What is the preferred server and storage platforms (hardware, OS, configuration)?
<p>This requirement is for a vendor-hosted environment. See #5 Description of Work in the Statement of Work.<br /><br />2. How much storage is anticipated at startup? What is the incremental growth requirements over the years?</p>
<p>Storage requirement will be dependent on vendor implementation. The content will be approximately 25-30 GB at startup. The estimated annual content increments in ILS will be about 2%. However, we plan to add the full text content of the NLM Digital Collections Repository, which is currently about 8 TB and will probably have an annual growth rate of 25%, to the new discovery and delivery platform in Option Year 1. The vendor is required to be capable of handling the potential expansion.<br /><br />3. What are the performance expectations (for example system availability, response time, etc.)?</p>
<p>See details in the Section 5.05 of the Description of Work requirements table.</p>
<p>4. Are there SLAs which NLM expects to achieve?</p>
<p>See details in the Description of Work requirements table.</p>
<p>5. What is the current number of items desired to be tracked and searched in the system?</p>
<p>The current number of items is approximately 3,100,000.</p>
<p>6. What is the projected number of items to be tracked and searched by year 5?</p>
<p>The projected number of items by year 5 will be approximately 3,400,000.</p>
<p>7. What is the current size of the existing database?</p>
<p>See the answers to Questions 2 and 5.</p>
<p>8. What is the maximum number of concurrent users currently?</p>
<p>We do not have the analytical tools to provide an accurate estimate for concurrent users. However, the usage of our online public access catalog (OPAC) in 2014 is reflected by the following numbers:<br />&bull; Average visits per day: 2,262<br />&bull; Average page views per day: 2,736<br /><br />9. What is the estimated number of maximum concurrent users within 5 year period?</p>
<p>We have no data to determine this, but we anticipate this number will grow with the implementation of a new discovery and delivery system. This system will be publically available internationally.</p>
<p>10. Is high availability and disaster recovery required?</p>
<p>See details in the Description of Work requirements table.</p>
<p>11. Do you have an existing entity enrichment technology that is used for MeSH markup?</p>
<p>Please clarify this question.</p>
<p>12. Do you have an existing semantics ontology for terminology explosion or will this need to be developed by the vendor?</p>
<p>No, this needs to be developed by the vendor.</p>
<p>13. Does the messaging capability to send results/information via text messages already exist at the NLM and the solution would integrate with that existing messaging system, or would the vendor handle this service?</p>
<p>No, the vendor should handle the text messaging service.</p>
<p>14. Sample queries</p>
<p>See attached document entitled "NLM OPAC - sample queries".</p>
<p>15. Samples of data and/or description of data (how many indexes, how many tables and how many columns each, plus total number of records in each table)</p>
<p>Records from various services are searchable and downloadable at the following sites:</p>
<p>Voyager ILS<br />http://locatorplus.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First</p>
<p>NLM Digital Collections Repository<br />http://collections.nlm.nih.gov/. One example record is http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/64310750R.</p>
<p>Additional Electronic Resources<br />Such as Profiles in Science at http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/. Details are available at http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/display/OaiPmhServiceHelp.</p>
<p>These services contain numerous tables, records, and indexes which are used by library business and too many to be enumerated here.</p>
<p>16. API documentation for various services required to integrate with (ILS, DOCLINE, etc.)</p>
<p>The documentation for various services required to integrate is at the following locations:<br />Voyager ILS<br />https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/voyager/apis</p>
<p>DOCLINE<br />There is no API for the DOCLINE system. Current integration happens using a framed in library catalog search view within DOCLINE that returns specific data fields such as title, ISSN, publisher, OCLC number, etc. This can be done with a screen scrape or other method but must use SSL communications. See details in the Section 4.03 of the Description of Work requirements table.</p>
<p>NLM Digital Collections Repository - <br />Currently, there is no API for the repository. However, the repository uses a Solr/Lucene search solution and so data could possibly be sent to the discovery platform from Solr. Alternatively we would work out another way to provide the files for indexing, either through Fedora, through the underlying file system directly or OAI-PMH (which we do not currently have implemented).<br /><br /><br />17. RFP, page 11, Section D.1 Price Information: Quoters are asked to submit a "detailed breakdown of estimated labor hours and rates by tasks to be performed".&nbsp; As this is a FFP response is a detailed breakdown of hours and rates required ? <br /><br />No, please disregard.<br /><br />18.&nbsp; SOW, page 32, Section 10, Invoicing Requirements: States "Invoices shall be submitted on an annual basis". Will the government revise this such that invoicing can be provided on a monthly basis, with the invoicing including the following elements:<br />- 1/12 of the annual fixed fees for web-based services<br />- 1/12 of annual software licensing fees<br />- FFP or T&amp;M for labor each month<br />- Authorized incremental labor each month<br />- Authorized project based labor each month<br />- Invoicing associated with deliverables or milestones</p>
<p>The contractor can provide invoices on a monthly basis.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; and 4 weeks after 3 years. Length of service includes the whole span of<br />continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and<br />with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same<br />Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS&nbsp;<br /><br />The evaluation factors below are not formal source selection procedures.</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award: Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA), responsive and responsible Offeror. This is a competitive LPTA selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers, with satisfactory past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort. For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>
<p>2. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach to accomplish assembly in accordance with MIL-A-8625 and MIL-STD-130 as required by the technical drawings.</p>
<p>3. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach, including tools and equipment required to perform assembly of the ATDC Frames. Specifically, the offeror shall provide the following information: Tool Name, Manufacturer, Part Number, and a brief description of how the tool will be used during the assembly process. The technical approach will be evaluated for:</p>
<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>c. Selection Decision:<br />The government shall select the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsive, and responsible offer for award.</p>
<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.<br />To be eligible for award of a Government contract, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). The link to the website is https://www.sam.gov.<br />No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. Quotes must be submitted in portable document format (.pdf) by email to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) identified below. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to submit offers to the POC at NSWC PHD by the closing date of January 21, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Southeast Sunbelt Region 4 announces the opportunity for a Design-Bid-Build Construction Contract for Renovation of VSR Resident Judge's Chambers in the Donald S. Russell Federal Building and Courthouse, 201 Magnolia Street, Spartanburg, South Carolina 29306.</p>
<p>The work includes the renovation of 3,040 square feet of office space for the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge's Chambers on the Third Floor of the Donald S. Russell Federal Building and Courthouse in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Renovations include the abatement of hazardous materials and a complete redesign of interior spaces and installation of new finishes. New millwork will be installed. The space will have a new sprinkler system extended into the tenant area. Mechanical and electrical systems will be renovated with new installation for this tenant. Sound attenuation is important in this project and design features shall be carefully followed to protect. The end product of construction must exhibit a very high level of finishes and workmanship. In general without force in the contract, the following items are included:</p>
<p>1. New wall, floor, and ceiling finishes<br />2. Some new plumbing fixtures<br />3. New lighting/power and data<br />4. Rework mechanical systems<br />5. New door systems<br />6. New toilet and break area<br />7. New custom millwork<br />8. Signage<br />9. Sprinkler renovation</p>
<p>The estimated price range is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The contract duration is 180 calendar days from the start date on the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The Small Business Size Standard for NAICS Code 236220 is $36,500,000.00 in average receipts over the past three (3) years.</p>
<p>Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable contractor.</p>
<p>The Government would rank proposals based on price, and then evaluate the lowest-priced proposal for technical acceptability. If the lowest-priced proposal was determined to be unacceptable, the new lowest-priced proposal would be evaluated. This would continue until an award is made to the lowest-priced propoasl found technically acceptable. <br /><br />FAR 15.101-2 describes the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process as follows:<br />(a) The lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. <br />(b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply: <br />(1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business' past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in Subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). <br />(2) Tradeoffs are not permitted. <br />(3) Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. <br />(4) Exchanges may occur (see 15.306).</p>
<p>A selection will be made off of the following solicitation factors:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. RELEVANT EXPERIENCE</span></strong></p>

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Technical competence and capability to meet the Government requirements.<br />The Government shall evaluate the offeror's ability to meet the requirement and conform to the specification in the solicitation based on its technical competence to include technical capability, personnel qualification and technical and management approach.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings Ratings Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>2. Past Performance<br />The Past Performance Evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by the offeror's record of past performance. In this context, "offeror" refers to the proposed prime contractor. <br /><br />Past performance will be evaluated as to its 1) relevancy (similar in scope, magnitude, or complexity to the requirement solicited); and 2) performance risk, (conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract schedules, ability to resolve technical or other problems effectively, and quality of products delivered), resulting in an overall past performance rating<br /><br />The offeror's performance for will be evaluated using the following ratings:<br /><br />Past Performance Ratings Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.).<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on the past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable".</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the Performance Risk Assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</p>
<p>3. Price<br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's cost/price proposal in order to assess the realism of the proposed cost/price, determine the probable cost to the Government, and to assist in determining the offeror's understanding of the technical requirements. <br />Award shall be made to the offeror with a technical acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services Nov 1999</p>
<p>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. Mar 2000</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.</p>

This notice is for planning purposes only and constitutes a request for exchange of information pursuant to FAR 15.201.  The purpose of this industry day is to exchange information to improve the understanding of Government requirements by industry, and to improve Government knowledge of industry capabilities.   The Government intends to use this forum to better refine its requirements, not to elicit trade secrets.   <br>  <br> This announcement should be not construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  Offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, in support of the Program Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for the Grenadier Sighting System (GSS). The GSS will replace the previously fielded day/night sight to the M320/M320A1 Grenade Launcher Module (GLM). The GSS will address the capability gap within forces to effectively engage targets, from 100 to 350 meters during day and 100 to 200 meters at night, with the M320/M320A1 GLM. <br>  <br> This GSS DRAFT RFP is issued under a Full and Open Competition.  The Government intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a short term advanced developmental effort, with a down-select to a single vendor for production.

Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified in the Buy Terms, below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance. <BR> <BR>Buyer intends to issue award using a purchase order or delivery order. Bids from Sellers unable to accept purchase orders or delivery orders will not be considered for award. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The last decade has produced a remarkable transformation in the digital world. Enlistees being sworn-in the fall of 2014 were born in 1996; back then, service members and their families used a computer with a modem on a desk to connect to the Internet and their new electronic-mail accounts.</p>
<p>Today, more than 90 percent of U.S. adults own mobile phones, 65 percent have smartphones, and 74 percent participate in social networks. That includes today's modern military community, 85 percent of whom are 35 years old and younger - "militaryennials."<br />Because of these deep-seated and ongoing changes, strategies of outreach and engagement require fresh approaches to forge and maintain interactive connections with our entire military community - service members, their families and their survivors, the service providers and Command.</p>

<DESC>The ARNG operates four ARNG Aviation Training Sites (AATS) located in West Virginia (FWAATS),Pennsylvania (EAATS), Colorado (HAATS), and in Arizona (WAATS). Each of the AATS serves as a critical component to the Total Army School System supporting multi-compo graduate, MOSQ, and ASI training. These schoolhouses have a direct impact on the ability of the service components to generate combat power and meet training requirements. The following Sources Sought Announcement consolidates the efforts at the EAATS, HAATS, and WAATS locations  <br>    <br>  The EAATS' mission and resources are provided and coordinated by the National Guard Bureau Headquarters Aviation and Safety Division (ARNG-AV) in Arlington, VA.  <br>  The Eastern Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (EAATS) was established in 1981 and is designed to fill a critical need in modernized aviator qualification and enlisted training in aircraft assigned to the Army National Guard. The EAATS is a TRADOC Total Army School System certified aviation training institution located on MUIR Army Airfield, Ft. Indiantown Gap, in central Pennsylvania. The EAATS conducts National Guard Bureau directed flight and academic instruction in the CH-47D/F and UH-60A/L aircraft, enlisted training for cargo and utility helicopter maintainers, noncommissioned officer professional education, and provides regional simulator support in the CH-47D/F,UH-60A/L and the UH-72A simulators for all Army components and international military students.  <br>    <br>  HAATS, located in Gypsum, Colorado, was established in 1985 and assigned to the Colorado Army National Guard as a tenant unit with support from the Army National Guard's Readiness Center. The organization conducts high-altitude Search and Rescue operations and executes Department of the Army directed functional training for the U.S. and allied military pilots and enlisted personnel in aviation skills pertaining to power management and environmental flight techniques in high density altitude and high aircraft gross weight conditions at altitude above 6,500 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). HAATS fills a critical need in environmental flight and power management and training in the UH-72A, UH-60A/L/M,CH-47D/F and other aircraft. HAATS supports both pre- and post-mobilization training, augmenting the Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) aviation training mission as an activity certified by the U.S. Army's Aviation Center.  <br>    <br>  The Western Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (WAATS) was established in 1986 as an accredited TRADOC Total Army School System (TASS) aviation training institution. Designed to fill a critical need for aviator and enlisted training in aircraft assigned to the Army National Guard, the WAATS is located on Silver Bell Army Heliport in Marana, AZ, as an Arizona National Guard tenant unit. Mission and resources are provided by the Army National Guard Headquarters in Arlington, VA.  <br>  As of Fiscal Year 2014, the WAATS mission has expanded to include individual raining and qualification in the UH-72 and UH-60A/L aircraft.

The proposed action is for the continuation of services performed by Klett Consulting Group in the development of Combatant Command Cyberspace Operations Command and Control Baseline models Version 1 and 2 that were accomplished under N00178-04-D-4079-0014.  The work required under the proposed action is to update and expand Version 2.0 to become the CCMD COC2 that can support the next Joint Chief of Staff Tank and support the next stage of Joint Force Development.  Because this work is an expansion of Kletts Baseline Model Version 2.0, no other sources are capable of performing this work.  As mentioned in the initial synopsis, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  However, all proposals received after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses may be emailed to nicholas.milillo@navy.mil. The Government will not pay for information received. For additional information concerning this requirement, please contact Nicholas Milillo at 215-697-0321.

<DESC>Title: 2015 Hawaii Clean Air, Energy and Climate Change Projects
The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted.  See below.
QUESTION1: Since the EPA has indicated on the SF 18 this is not a small business set aside, can you please confirm this solicitation will be conducted under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures? ANSWER1: Yes, this procurement is still being conducted under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Based on our market research and historical data, this procurement was identified as not a small business set aside.  
QUESTION2: In Section III - Past Performance. We are asked to provide at least (3) project summaries related to clean energy, climate change and sustainability. We are planning to provide EPA projects as two of the three examples. Is this acceptable, or does EPA wish to see other non-EPA related performance metrics that may not be so closely tied to the three areas of focus?   ANSWER2: You may include any examples that fit as closely to the requested summaries.  QUESTION3: We intend to submit for the RFQ-CA-15-00004 proposal as it ties in so closely with our programming. However, we are also very interested in the RFP number EPA-EE-14-02 titled Environmental Education Local Grants Program. Would EPA award two proposals to one organization? ANSWER3: This procurement is only pertaining to RFQ-CA-15-00004 and has no impact on any other RFP.

All other Solicitation information remains the same.

Interested parties submitting a quote shall acknowledge this amendment by completing one of the methods outlined in box 11 on STANDARD FORM 30. Find attachment by accessing the FedConnect link below.
Interested parties shall still complete all relevant sections on the STANDARD FORM 18 (included with the original posting) and include it with their quote.
