<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER for The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Program Services (OPS) to the US Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association (USPRA).

The purpose of this project is to contract with the USPRA to identify any gaps in core competencies that relate to the components of recovery, develop the missing competencies, and develop and pilot test a training manual. The manual will be one that can be used by psychiatric rehabilitation personnel and other mental health service providers to increase knowledge and skills so that services and supports will be more recovery-oriented and consumer-driven.

The USPRA in 2006 released Psychiatric Rehabilitation Skills in Practice:  CPRP Preparation and Skills Workbook. The publication provides relevant and applied information about skills assessment, development, and delivery in psychiatric rehabilitation. Core competencies including knowledge and skills are identified in eleven domains of practice.  These range from interpersonal and professional role competencies to treatment and rehabilitation interventions to diversity and cultural competencies. 

Many of the identified competencies in the Workbook relate to the ten components of recovery identified in the recovery consensus statement. However, not all recovery components are fully addressed in the workbook. Also, there is no known curriculum that provides training and education to psychiatric rehabilitation personnel on the integration of recovery concepts and principles into their practice. There is a need to enhance the knowledge and skills of the many psychiatric rehabilitation personnel that staff a range of programs---from clubhouses to supportive employment to housing---that provide mental health services and supports to many persons with mental illnesses across the nation.  Therefore in response to the need to make mental health services and supports more recovery-oriented, the following objectives are proposed. 

Interested parties possessing these required capabilities should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor?s name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor?s Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small business concerns (including small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, etc.) are encouraged to review this notice.  E-mail capability statement to bjmiller@psc.gov, referencing the Pre-solicitation Number 07M000154 in the subject.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any requests for solicitation packages will be disregarded.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justificaiton and Approval (J&A) on a brand name description is essentail to the Governmen’t requirements for Department of State infrastructure interoperability and connectivity with mission critical communications systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Network Appliance products as a key component of the Deparment’s core Microsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure on OpenNet.  The equipment listed above is required to support continuing operations of the Departmen’ts Enterprise E-Mail systems.  The curent Network Appliance systems provide storage for over 14,000 user mailboxes.  This acquisiton will allow MSO to support the Department’s IRM Bureau consolidation efforts and provide storage for 25,000 users on OpenNet.  This will also enable MSO to provide increased storage space for users – 500 MB mailboxes vs current mailbox size for users which is restricted to 100 MB.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO have committed to shared platform at a common alternate site for disaster recovery capability based upon Network Appliance technology. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core Micrsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure.  Network Appliance provided hardware, software, and services provide support for current E-Mail Central Site operations.  Network Appliance systems are tightly integrated with Microsoft Exchange and integrate semealessly into the Department’s networking infrastructre.  Therefore, Network Appliance has a thorough understanding of Microsoft Exchange and the Department’s operational requirements.  No other supplier possesses this level of capability and understanding.  Acquistion of storage systems from any other supplieir would involve substantial risk in the areas of quality and continuity of operations, cost for maintaining current operations, and schedule for deployment of Central Site consolidation capabilities.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO will be able to exploit a common platform based upon Network Appliance architecture and systems for  disaster recovery.  Economies of scale gained through the use of this common, shared platform for disaster recovery will result in savings of $1M to $3M for the Department.<BR><BR>

In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (no daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post’s ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department’s requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described above. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>

The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation is a small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation features the Intel Core 2 Duo dual-core processor. Dual core processors can deliver a substantial performance increase over single-core processors for multi-threaded applications, multi-tasking environments, or demanding single-threaded applications, allowing the user to work with noticeably quicker results. The tool-less access chassis design of the workstation is efficient, open, quiet, and easy to maintain, service, and upgrade. The dc7700 SFF workstation can be customized to fit CST requirements. 2)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality:  Hardware: •	Fujitsu fi-4220C document scanner (USB) •	Gryphon D220 barcode scanner (USB) •	Hewlett-Packard Business Inkjet 1100d printer (USB) •	NEC Multisync LCD (liquid crystal display) 1760V monitor •	PKI (public key infrastructure) (USB) •	Smiths Heimann Biometrics ACCO 1394 single fingerprint scanner (FireWire) •	Cross Match L SCAN Guardian fingerprint scanner •	Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner •	Dell UltraSharp 1905FP (flat panel) monitor Software: •	ACRS (Automated Cash Register System), version 07.00.02 •	ACS (American Citizen Services) Plus, version 1.02.01 •	CST (Consular Shared Tables), version 04.01.00 •	CST_PWD (Consular Shared Tables – Password) version 01.02.00 •	INK (Independent Name Check), version 01.02.02 •	IV (Immigrant Visa), version 04.03.00 •	NIV (Nonimmigrant Visa System), version 04.04.00 COTS Software: •	Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0 •	Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, Service Pack 2 (SP2) •	Microsoft Office 2003 Professional, Service Release 2 (SR2) •	Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition, version 10.0.2.2021 •	Oracle Client 9i •	WinZip 9.0 In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the HP dc7700 SFF workstation is procured at this time.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell Optiplex 745 minitower workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex 745 minitower workstation as a key component for overseas Consular offices.  The Dell Optiplex 745 minitower was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular offices.

The workstation meets all of the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements. The Dell Optiplex 745 workstation features a BTX (balanced technology extended) chassis, power supply and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency, improved reliability, and quieter operation.  Dell's chassis design provides tool-less access to the system and components for quick service.

The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

<DESC>Background
A little more than 25 years have passed since the first U.S. diagnosed case of AIDS.  Although many efforts have been made to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., Americans continue to be affected by increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.   HIV/AIDS is a health problem too complex for a single organization to address. Efforts must be increased to collaborate with leaders and organizations in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Partnerships are a critical component of CDC?s efforts in the Advancing HIV Prevention (AHP) initiative.  Achieving CDC?s HIV prevention goals, and the objectives of AHP, requires effective collaboration and coordination with new and traditional partners.  

The National HIV/AIDS Partnership (NHAP) seeks to prevent the spread of HIV through the collective resources and talents of dynamic partnerships between public and private sectors. Additionally, NHAP seeks to mobilize public-private sectors to include the faith community and its leadership, to increase support for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in the United States through various recognition activities and events such as the Red Ribbon Leadership Awards. 

The objectives of NHAP are to:
?	disseminate NHAP prevention messages regarding benefits of early HIV testing, prevention, and care;
?	address the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS by promoting open dialogue about the disease, and support for those persons living with HIV and AIDS; and
?	increase the ability of partners to promote HIV prevention awareness within their organizations and communities.


Please note the following items relevant to the attached solicitation

?	Competition:  Certified 8(a) firms only. Ref Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15USC637(a) )

?	Deadline for Submission of Questions:  August 7, 2007, 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) in collaboration with National Institutes of Justice (NIJ), and the Department of Defense (DoD) contemplates awarding a cost plus fixed fee contract to implement a population-based survey in all U.S. states and territories to generate national and state-level estimates of the prevalence and incidence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) and to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and consequences of IPV in the military and non-military populations. 

The project requires the contractor to conduct a population-based survey that will provide accurate and reliable estimates of the incidence and prevalence of IPV and SV and self-directed violence (SDV) at the national level and to the extent possible at state, regional and territory level.  The survey, that will assess both victimization and/or perpetration, will provide critical information about IPV and SV victimization and/or prevalence characteristics, circumstances, consequences, and help seeking behavior among English and/or Spanish speaking male and female adults (18 years and older).  Special consideration will be given to special populations for inclusion in the sample, specifically 1) all female members of the active duty component of the US Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy); 2) all female spouses of married male service members; and 3) over-sampling for American Indian and Alaskan Native women.  The contractor will work with CDC to incorporate feedback from an expert panel and the results of a pilot survey conducted during January through April 2007.

This effort is for a base year of 30 months with 4 options periods of 12 months each.  No determination for a set-aside has been made yet.  However, the Government will consider responses to this presolicitation notice in making a set-aside determination.  According, interested offerors are encouraged to submit a brief statement of capabilities relevant to this requirement and indicate their business status.  The NAICS code is 541990.  The solicitation is scheduled to be posted to fedbizops on or about 22 May 2007.  A hard copy solicitation will not be issued.  All responses shall be submitted via email to Ms. Vallerie Redd at gfj3@cdc.gov.   No telephone request/inquires will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for systems engineering training for the Shuttle Orbiter Project Office and Shuttle Systems Engineering and Integration Office. The training program shall accommodate attendance of 60 technical professionals for three consecutive days.  The training shall be conducted on-site at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas and the offeror shall be responsible for providing all necessary training materials, textbooks, and course materials. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase these services from the California Institute of Technology, Industrial Relations Center I-90, Pasedena, CA	91125.	Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  (1) Caltech has customized an existing course of study and developed a curriculum tailored to JSC's objectives and needs and NASA Procedural Requirements; (2) Caltech has previously customized Systems Engineering courses for government, aerospace, and government aerospace agencies including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Reconnaissance Office and both spaceflight and research centers at NASA; and (3) Caltech's combination of training expertise, technical ability, and past performance with other government agencies gives it a unique capability to support the training needs of JSC's technical professionals in the Shuttle Orbiter Project and Shuttle Systems Engineering and Integration Offices.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on  August 6, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The goal of the Large Tactical Sensor Networks program is to develop and demonstrate software algorithms and technologies to function with capabilities utilized by units at the tactical level.  These sensor algorithms and technologies will function in a net-centric enterprise Service Oriented Architecture environment, when applicable, to provide users with automation for the intelligent management of sensing of multi-INT resources and fusion of data in near real-time (NRT) to support the user’s mission needs against an asymmetric threat.  The program will develop software tools that will work with the sensors for smart sensor data processing and enable sensor tagging and tracking of entities. 

The program is structured around the following thrust areas:  

• Designing tools for mission specific tactical sensor fields capable of fulfilling specific mission objectives
• Developing smart tactical sensors, platforms and algorithms capable of forwarding information/knowledge vice raw data
• Creating a service oriented sensor network (SOA) for expeditionary forces’ current and future tactical sensors 
• Creating fusion tools capable of translating tactical sensor data into appropriate situational awareness for expeditionary forces in near real-time.  This includes developing knowledge discovery engines and automatic alerts that enable the "right information" to be pushed/pulled and creating alerts for time sensitive warning.
• Designing autonomous platforms and automatic sensor planning and management tools to ensure that the right data is collected by the right sensor in support of intelligence requirements 
• Developing tailored tactical Human to Machine Interfaces aligned to primary operational functions and non-intrusive within the battlespace and
• Creating services for the tactical network that are fully operable with DCGS and the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB)
 
White Papers are encouraged prior to submitting a full proposal.  White papers will be evaluated to determine whether an offeror is encouraged to make an oral presentation of its white paper to a panel of Government evaluators.  An offeror may submit a full proposal without submitting a white paper or making an oral presentation.

Approximately $25M is available in FY07 for efforts over a 1-3 year timeframe.  ONR plans to issue an annual BAA for this program.  The total funding for the program is anticipated to be $84M during FY07-FY11.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is FA8902-07-Q-8888 and is being issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporate provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16 (22 Mar 2007) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement change notice 20070327.  The NAICS code is 541380 with a small business size standard not to exceed $11M.  

The contractor shall furnish all tools, labor, equipment, transportation, and other incidentals necessary to provide flame resistance testing of the 36 Flame Resistant Combat Ensemble (FRCE) and six Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) configurations. The FRCE, composed of a FR shirt and trouser, will provide an increased degree of protection most needed for our Marines and Sailors against a broad spectrum of environmental, occupational and battlefield hazards, while offering them added protection against heat exhaustion with moisture wicking and quick drying capabilities.  The FRCE will also provide the necessary protection, safety and comfort features required by the Marine Corps, such as flame protection and design features to preclude heat exhaustion in hot weather conditions.  As a continuous effort to improve the FR combat ensemble performance, we will be testing prototypes from as many as five suppliers.

We are seeking to contract for testing of 42 each FRCE, and MCCUU configurations.  The FRCE configuration consists of the current FRCE (6 each) and fabrics used from five different suppliers (30 each).  The fabrics used in the current FRCE are made with two materials; in the torso area, a modacrylic blended knit and in the sleeves and the trousers, a FR rayon blended woven fabric. The additional FRCE?s will be made from five different vendors, and will all be made with fabrics that self-extinguish and do not melt or drip.  We do not know the exact fabric details.  The fabrics in the MCCUU are a blend of 50% nylon and 50% cotton.  This fabric is not FR. All garments will be provided in an unwashed condition.  The objective of the testing is to determine the various materials? resistance to a 4 second simulated flash fire exposure using the procedures in ASTM F 1930 Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection Against Flash Fire Simulations Using an Instrumented Manikin. The test results will be used to evaluate the FR characteristics of the fabrics and garment design of the five suppliers to the current FR combat ensemble and MCCUU.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of these units are not available from the Army. Due to obsolescence in components and materials that has occurred over the life of this equipment, and also due to undocumented technical changes which have not been incorporated into the Government drawings. The Government can no longer warrant the adequacy of the Government owned drawings. Since no GFE is available from the Government, Suppliers must indicate their ability to demonstrate that the item operates properly in the End item AN/TPX-46(V). Suppliers capable of furnishing any, or all, of these items must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USACECOM,  ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-CM, Building 1201E, Ft. Monmouth, NJ 07703-5023. The response must include documentation such as test results, copy of purchase order if the supplier was a vendor to the listed source or a statement from listed  source demonstrating that the supplier can, in fact, supply the Army with a unit that will be physically and functionally interchangeable and has been demonstrated to operate properly in the AN/TPX-46(V).

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS, intends to negotiate with NOVA Southeastern University, of Fort Lauderdale, FL. for the continuation of Services of the Coral Extension, Density, and Calcification Records from the Florida Keys and Caribbean Sea: Calibration of proxy records from coral skeletons to paleoclimatic data. Massive corals growing in South Florida, Florida Keys, and wider Caribbean have been cored and these cores are archived for future use. Over 144 cores have been collected as part of coring expeditions throughout the Keys and South Florida. These cores have been catalogued by collection data and location. Cores have been collected which contain records of growth and environmental conditions dating by to 1694. Growth data can be measured by a process of optical densitometry of X-radiographs which provides direct measurement of skeletal bulk-density, linear extension rates, and the determination of calcification rates. The intent is for the University to continue the collection and analysis of coral skeletal growth data to coordinate the comparison of geochemical and growth chronologies. Priorities of the work period will be to complete the collection of extension, density and calcification data from the 300+ year coral and to initiate such work on other specimens. The University will collect up to three additional cores from multi-century old corals from Broward County in June 2007 to corroborate in the influence of Everglades freshwater discharge discovered in the existing original cores. Growth and geochemical data will be  analyzed and compared using the CoralXDS+ program. The purpose of the work will be to demonstrate: 1) Multiple corals are capable of recording a common growth response to stress over a background of natural variability. 2) Growth response of Southeast Florida corals correlates to environmental stress conditions (including salinity from increased correlation between growth  rate and environmental stressor. 4) Recent correlations between growth and environment can be used to assess multi-century growth records for prior occurrence and frequency. Deliverables will include three new multi-century cores from Broward County, Southeast Florida. Extension, density, and calcification data from among the following target sites: 1) Broward County 2) Puerto Rico 3) Dry Tortugas 4) US Virgin Islands 4) Key Largo/Crocker Reef SST/SSS record (finalize record) 

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE$100K) NAIC code 611310. Interested persons may identify their interest and must demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for this opportunity. This is not a  request for Competitive proposal.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Loop Stability Analysis System. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the Loop Stability Analysis System, NI GPIB-USB-HS, Injection Transformer Kit, Clip-On Injection Transformer, 100A Input/Output Impedance Measurement Set, and Calibration Certification from Venable Industries. Venable Inc. is the only company to meet all the requirements stated below. The Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) requires the use of a frequency response analyzer to measure and test the load impedance rating upon the specifications for any new electrical power consuming equipment that enters into the space craft system. To perform this test, JSC must input an AC signal from a frequency analyzer which will be coupled by a transformer to form a normalized base DC input impedance. In order for the transformer to couple the AC signal the current rating requirement of 100 amps must be met. This rating ensures that there will not be a core saturation that will alter the test results. The system must also meet the magnitude limit over the frequency range of 50Hz to 100kHz. The minimum load input impedance is identified to avoid potential stability problems with the electrical power system (EPS) and an electrical power consuming equipment (EPCE) with insufficient input filtering. This system provides a frequency range of .01Hz to 2.2MHz. By meeting the specified frequency range, and possessing a frequency analyzer that can read lower range impedance, JSC can easily identify the impedance level sooner before reaching the bounded 50Hz to 100kHz range.	  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 3, 2007.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The University of Milan, Via Festa Del Perdono 7, Milan, Italy for laboratory services to perform PCR-based analysis of telomere length on 2000 buccal DNA samples (extracted using Gentra products) and 800 blood DNA in duplicate from the U.S. Agricultural Health Study (AHS) using real-time PCR technology.  Genetic integrity is maintained, in part, by the architecture of telomeres. Telomeres are complexes of tandem repeats of DNA (10-15 kb, 5'-TTAGGG-3') and proteins that cap eurkaryotic chromosomes. The telomeres of invasive human cancers often appear shorter than their normal tissue counterparts.  Shorter telomere length has been associated with increased risk of several cancers, including prostate cancer.  Human prostate carcinogenesis has been proposed as a consequence of chromosomal instability mediated by shortened, dysfunctional telomeres and telomere shortening was seen in even high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, a putative prostate cancer precursor.  In vitro data showed that inhibition of telomerase is related to the life span and tumorigenicity of human prostate cancer cells.  Telomere length exhibits inter-subject variations in the population, as shortened telomeres have been related to aging and other cellular and individual processes. The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory of the University of Milan, Italy is the only source known to the NCI Researcher that is currently taking on projects that has the expertise and resources necessary to perform telomere length analysis by real time PCR with the sensitivity and precision needed to test the study hypothesis. The laboratory applies the technique developed by Dr. Cawthon, University of Utah. At the University of Milan, telomere length is measured with a coefficient of variation in repeated measurements in the same plate equal to 9.1%. The coefficient of variation in measurements repeated in different plates is 7.1%. Such measurements of reproducibility are equivalent to those reported by Cawthon et al. (Nucleic Acid Research, 2002, 30:e47). The laboratory implements standardized QC/QA procedures to ensure the correct processing of the samples and the high quality of assays. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service they may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 2, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS 541380. Size Standard $11M.

BRAND NAME LETTER IS AS FOLLOWS:

1. Requiring Authority:  615th CRW, UTC Management office, 424-5342

2.  Contracting Agency:  60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
     
3.  Purchase Request #:  TAFB 200700553, dated 04 Jun 07

4.  Description of Requirement:  One Motorola XTS5000 Land Mobile Radio and necessary hardware and software required to be compatible with existing equipment. Additionally a requirement for 5 KVL-3000s to meet current AF encryption standards. The estimated value is $82,000.00.

5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one brand name and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

6.  Justification or Authority for action:

(a.)	Currently, Motorola Inc. is the only manufacturer of radio equipment that meets NSA?s policy guidance for the keying material program for the Astro Digital XTS-5000 radio using the AES 256 Type encryption.

(b.)	Motorola Inc. is the only known brand that can satisfy the Government?s requirement for compatibility with the existing system on base.  The 615th CRW needs encryption capable LMR systems, consisting of the proposed Motorola equipment list, to be capable of conventional use while in austere environments.  Also, the radios need ruggedized housing that can be submersible to 6?, and this is only available through Motorola.

(c.)	Without these radios, the deployed personnel would not be able to communicate with their work control centers, each other, and the rest of the deployed team necessary to perform the mission.

7.   Market Research/ Other Facts: A statement of actions, if any, that may be taken to remove or overcome any barriers that preclude surveying at lease 3 schedule contractors or reviewing catalogs or pricelist, for future acquisitions.

Under this tasking Boeing will provide a laser program to assess cabin and aft fuselage mating surfaces and splice fasteners of station 410 and for relative positioning in the surface plane.  The laser data will provide a mapping in aircraft coordinates for each aircrafts splice location from laser data points.  The laser data will create a historical data back for each airframe.  The laser program will also provide a laser program to validate drive system component alignment on flight status aircraft.  The laser data using Insight software will provide measurement in aircraft coordinates specific to that derived from using conventional optical tooling with the drive system removed.  The development of this laser process will significantly reduce labor associated with conventional means.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days. This is an  unrestricted acquisition in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note).

1) Q.  How many of the Boiler tubes are to be purchased in each size. Shipping of tubes varies on the amount of the boiler tubes and weight?  Will the Boiler tubes will be sent to the CHP / storage.  

   A.  This is up to the contractor, as Section VI. On page 7 states GSA will not purchase the materials until there is a need for them, therefore until such time arises any tubes and or materials will be considered the property of the contractor. However, this does not relieve the contractor from meeting the time lines for repairs. The tubes and or materials can be stored at the CHP; however CHP assumes no liability for the material stored within or at the facility.

2) Q.  How long is the U-bends and Straight tube repairs required?
Tube Length will be a factor in Labor / Material Costs.

3) Q.  Baffle plates show 1.5" they are fabricated with 1/4" plate.  Clarify?

   A.  The baffle plates should be ? inch and price for 32 sq.ft.

4) Q.  Erection / Installation of Scaffold for the Inside of the boiler only.  Or is it required to have scaffold outside. Patton or Pole Scaffold?

   A.  Work can be accomplished outside by working off buckstays / catwalks and related supports. Give pricing for both inside and outside of the boiler. The type of scaffolding is the choice of the contractor.

5) Q.  Testing of the Boilers has to have inspections and Hydro-tests of the Boiler after work is completed What is the time frame on filling and testing all of the Boilers?

8) Q.  Will all of the Materials will be shipped to the CHP at one time and staged or will the materials will be sent as needed. Costs will fluctuate with periodic deliveries Clarify?

   A.  This will also be up to the contractor, because CHP is not purchasing the materials until they are actually used by CHP.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Aninze Awanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-443-1328, Fax 757-443-1337, Email aninze.awanna@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy Source Selection Plan (SSP)on 03 August 2007, located at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in this announcement. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 and SSP will be posted on or before 03 August 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Biological Testing Branch (BTB), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking organizations having the capability to provide a genetic monitoring resource for the BTB. Genetic monitoring for quality assurance will accompany the long standing efforts in microbiological quality control, in order that each animal produced from rederived stock, under our production contracts, is as well defined as possible. The contractor will develop a genotyping panel for genetic monitoring of approximately 27 inbred mice and 3 inbred rat strains by an approved DNA-based method.  The contractor must also be able to perform additional methods of genetic testing i.e.; skin grafts and biochemical markers as required.  The validation and verification of the genetic status of the inbred colonies will be performed at a rate of approximately 15-30 animals per week.

<DESC>24 July 2007: Please note updated POC information.
<br><br>

Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.  Personnel qualifications ? the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced professional personnel in several specific disciplines for technical roles.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 541511 are invited to participate in this competitive procurement.  Teaming and/or Joint Ventures are also encouraged.

<SUBJECT>S -- Distributed Generation of Department of Defense Installations in the State of Hawaii
<SOLNBR>N62742-07-R-1118
<RESPDATE>080907
<CONTACT>Mark Asato, Contract Specialist, Phone (808) 471-5691, Fax (808) 471-5881, Email DodHiGen@navy.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) will be hosting an Industry Forum on 15-16 August 2007 at the Lanai Ballroom, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay Officers Club, on the island of Oahu.  The Forum will focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation, with an emphasis on renewable energy, for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and to obtain information in regard to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.  These installations include but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  To register for the Industry Forum, please visit the website at:  https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacpac. 

In 2004, the combined military branches in Hawaii controlled 236,303 acres.  On the island of Oahu, the military controls 85,718 acres.  Collectively in calendar year 2006, the military consumed 1,198,800 MWhrs with a consolidated electric bill of $187 Million.
Specifically, the DoD desires to acquire power generated from conventional and alternative fuel sources, and renewable energy sources as defined in Executive Order 13423 ((renewable energy) means energy produced by solar, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project).  Energy displacement projects, such as solar water heaters that displace heating energy, are not part of this scope, unless innovatively combined with another generating technology.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.  It is the desire of the DoD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal government entity or entities.
The desire of the DoD is to purchase power without any direct interest in the ownership or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets.  The DoD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a Public Private Venture (PPV), and/or an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL).  The DoD may consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government.
Specific sites for potential distributed generation plants will be shared at the Industry Forum.
Finally, it is the DoDs intent to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. Currently the electricity rate for DoD installations ranges from $0.14/kWh (installations on the island of Oahu) to $0.30/kWh (installations on the island of Kauai).
Specifically, the DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to; awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State Tax Credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Credit (REC) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of the DoD.
The DoD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than the DoD is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation asset would be envisioned, and what acreage of land would be developed.  Furthermore, the DoD requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site for the distributed generation system would be unspecified. Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.  The DoD plans to provide site specific information, including capacity or size of generation asset required and acreage of land available, at the Industry Forum.
The DoD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the Governments intent with this RFI to receive Industrys Input as stated in the Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired.
The Forum concept is to focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regards to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.
All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages. POC: MARK ASATO (808) 471-5691 OR EMAIL: DoDHiGen@navy.mil

<DESC>NASA Presolicitation Notice: Advisory to Industry and Academia to Mark Calendars to Attend an Important Preproposal Conference in Preparation for Addition of the Integration of Advanced Concepts and Vehicles into the Next Generation Air Transportation System research topic under the Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is preparing a major Program addition to the “Research Opportunities in Aeronautics” (ROA) NASA Research Announcement (NRA), (NRA number NNH07ZEA001N).	As a means of keeping interested parties informed and to assist in planning attendance to the Preproposal Conference, the following information is provided: Date of Preproposal Conference: August 9, 2007 Location: L'Enfant Plaza  Hotel, Washington D.C. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is preparing a major addition to the “Research Opportunities in Aeronautics” (ROA) NASA Research Announcement (NRA), (NRA number NNH07ZEA001N).	In keeping with the current structure of the ROA NRA, ARMD plans to amend the NRA by adding an Appendix with the detailed requirements of the Integration of Advanced Concepts and Vehicles into the Next Generation Air Transportation System proposal topic.  To further elaborate, this NRA is to conduct systems analyses to understand the issues associated with the coordinated deployment of new and advanced concepts and vehicles in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), including interactions among the vehicles, operational procedures, and NextGen Concept of Operations (ConOps).  This study constitutes a major undertaking of importance to NASA’s entire Aeronautics program portfolio.  The effort will establish an analysis infrastructure that can be used to answer questions involving the interaction of air traffic management, vehicle, safety, and environmental issues. The study will also be coordinated with other relevant studies, including NextGen trade studies sponsored by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO).  This NRA is being planned as a multi-million dollar effort performed over a period of one to two years, with potential for follow-on efforts.   As part of the preparatory efforts to add the Integration of Advanced Concepts and Vehicles into the Next Generation Air Transportation System topic to the ROA NRA, ARMD plans to conduct a Pre-proposal Conference on August 9, 2007 at the L’Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Interaction with the broad aeronautics community at the Pre-proposal Conference will support refinement of the NRA topic to be released soon after the conference.  Opportunity to ask questions, solicit clarification, and offer improvements to the study scope will be provided.  Teaming discussions with other participants will be encouraged.  Further details for the conference will be posted in the very near future on the ARMD Web site http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/nra.htm      .   Point of Contact: Questions or comments about plans for the addition of the above described effort or the upcoming Pre-proposal Conference may be forwarded by email to Mr. Jay Dryer or Dr. John A. Cavolowsky at 'NASA-roa@nasa.gov'.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled AGENCY-WIDE HELIUM REQUIREMENTS (Solicitation Number: NNK07192919E) which was posted on June 4, 2007 (Solicitation posted June 20, 2007).   This notice constitutes amendment number 01.  This notice services as the official amendment to the subject synopsis/solicitation and a written amendment will not be issued.   The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that have been raised in response to the solicitation.  No further written inquiries will be accepted once this amendment is posted.  The due date for responses is not extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.  Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). QUESTION 1 - Reference: C5.6. Residual Credit (Page 16), paragraph (b)(2) - “…remaining in the trailer by the price established in subject table in Section J.”  This section refers to "Section J"; we were not able to find this section in the solicitation.  What does it refer to?  RESPONSE - The reference of “Section J” was cited in error.	The residual credit table, which C5.6., paragraph (b)(2) refers to is located in Section D, Attachment 011 - Residual Credit. QUESTION 2 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 13), Delivery Point 7 (Kennedy Space Center), paragraph (d) - Special delivery equipment.  Will you accept deliveries in tankers containing approximately 51,560 liters also known as 15,000 gallon containers?  RESPONSE - Yes, the Government will accept deliveries in tankers containing approximately 51,560 liters, also known as 15,000 gallon containers; however, the delivery of any 15,000 gallon tanker will require pre-planning and coordination with the user location prior to delivery.  Typically these 15,000 gallon tankers do not have as long a hold time as the 11,000 gallon tankers, which may hinder their use for routine deliveries; however, these containers could be utilized during scheduled periods of high usage (e.g., during launch campaigns or when refilling 30,000 gallon dewars). QUESTION 3 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 27), Delivery Point 12 (Michoud Assembly Facility), paragraph (c)(1) - Peak requirements.  How many times per year is Michoud expected to hit their peak requirement of 50,000 liters?  RESPONSE - It is anticipated that a peak requirement of 50,000 liter is expected to occur once per year. QUESTION 4 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 27), Delivery Point 12 (Michoud Assembly Facility), paragraph (f) - Government furnished equipment.  Who is responsible to retest and maintain the tube trailers and dewars?  RESPONSE - Retest and maintenance of Government-furnished tube trailers and dewars will be the responsibility of the Government.  The costs of basic/minor maintenance of Government-owned equipment will be subject to the maintenance pricing list requested in the solicitation.	 QUESTION 5 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 30), Delivery Point 15 (Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc.), paragraph (c) - Peak requirements.  How many times per year is Canoga Park expected to hit their peak requirement of 1,000,000 SCF per month?  RESPONSE - Delivery Point 15 is currently expanding and expects moderate growth in usage.	It is anticipated that a peak requirement of 1,000,000 SCF is expected to occur once per year.  QUESTION 6 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 32), Delivery Point 17 (ATK Thiokol Propulsion), paragraph (c) - Peak requirements.  How many times per year is ATK expected to hit their peak requirement of 400 liters per month?	RESPONSE - It is anticipated that a peak requirement of 400 liters is expected to occur once per year. QUESTION 7 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 33), Delivery Point 18 (Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, Palestine TX), paragraph (b)(2) - Routine requirements.  Are modules for shipment to Port Hueneme required to be “3,000 PSIG and containing at least 180,000 CF?”  Will jumbo tube trailers be accepted if they don't meet this criteria?  RESPONSE - No, jumbo tube trailers will not be accepted unless they meet the criteria. QUESTION 8 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 34), Delivery Point 18 (Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, Palestine TX), paragraph (d) - Special delivery equipment requirements.  Do you require the plate to list all tube water volumes or the total?	RESPONSE - The plate is to provide the water volumes for each tube in a trailer and a total water volume of the whole trailer. QUESTION 9 - Estimated volumes [Attachment 004, Pages 4-5] for both Palestine & Ft. Sumner [Delivery Points 18 and 19 – Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (Attachment 003, Pages 33-36)] are significantly larger than in past consumption; was this perhaps an oversight in calculation or are there new programs with higher demand for these locations?  RESPONSE - New forecast launches are creating higher projected demand. QUESTION 10 - Residual credit usually does not apply for cylinder products in the commercial market; does NASA require residual or may we remove that requirement for cylinder products?  RESPONSE - Residual credit applies to bulk gaseous helium trailers and bulk liquid helium tankers only.  Cylinder gaseous helium or dewar liquid helium are not subject to residual credit. QUESTION 11 - Why are some CLINS the same per location for different quantities of product?  RESPONSE - A CLIN (e.g., 0101) specifies the best estimated quantity (e.g., 720 liters) for a particular requirement (e.g., MIL-PRF-27401C liquid helium).  The same CLIN is listed multiple times because the best estimated quantity (BEQ) has been separated and shown in different size containers (e.g., 720 liters in a 30-liter dewar) to assist the supplier in planning.  For locations where the same CLIN has multiple BEQs (one for each size container), the total BEQ for that CLIN is the sum of all the BEQs for the different sizes. QUESTION 12 - Reference: Attachment 003 (Page 31), Delivery Point 16 (Stennis Space Center).  Are the tube trailers dropped and swapped or is the helium cascaded into on-site storage?  RESPONSE - The normal mode is for trailers to be delivered to SSC where they are pumped (not cascaded) into the SSC GHe system.  Typical onsite time of the trailers once arrived at the receiving facility at SSC is 1.5 to 2 hours.

The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to RFQ-TX-07-00058 is to provide answers to questions for this RFQ.

1. Is there an incumbent or preferred contractor?  This is a new contract to coach our senior managers.  If so, who is it?

2. Is this a follow-on to an existing contract or a re-bid/re-write of a previous contract?  Please see answer above.  If so, who had the existing/previous contract?

3. If a previous contractor existed, is there any reason for you to believe that this contractor would not be bidding this RFP?  This question has very little to do with clarification of and objectives of the Statement of Work.  

4. What is your budget for this work?  It is not EPA?s policy to ask for request for quotes from vendors and then tell the vendor our budget.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to review the Statement of Work and provide the best quote for the work.

5. Is this work effort funded?  Yes.  If so, for how long?  This contract is a two year contract that will expire on September 30, 2009.  This contract can be extended beyond 2009 for one year if EPA wishes to continue the contract.  In that case the contract will expire in 2010 if the option is executed.
 

6. The Project Description states ??10 senior management team of EPA Region 6?.?  Is this one team of 10 people, or ten teams of ?? people?  If the latter, how many people in a team?  The executive coaching will include 10 managers from the senior staff.

7. Please explain how you want us to quote a price to you.  The SF18 gives a Quantity of 1 and a Unit of a year; what price do you want?  For example, Executive Coaching can take many sessions, some of varying lengths, depending on the person being coached.  Do you want a ?one session? price, for one time during the year, or an hourly labor rate, or what?  How do we calculate the number of sessions in an entire year?  Please extend your answer to include Group Coaching, 2-day Training, Presentations and Meetings, and Brown Bag sessions.  One-on-one coaching should be billed on a hourly rate.  One-on-one coaching sessions are one hour and group coaching sessions can range from 1-4 hours.

8. How many people do you anticipate will participate in a 2-day retreat?  16-20.
How many retreats per year?  Approximately 4-6 retreats per year.

9. How often will you plan to have consultant presentations and meetings with management?  Meetings and presentations will be provided to members of senior staff and ocassionally the vendor may be asked to conduct a presentation to EPA's management.   The vendor may be asked to provide approximately 4-6  presentations to the EPA's management chain.   How long do you anticipate these sessions will last?  Approximately 1-2 hours.  

10. How often will you plan to have brown bag luncheons?  The brown bag lunch sessions can range from anywhere to 3-12 times per year.  EPA will provide the books and the books will be chosen in consultation with EPA's senior management and the executive coach.  

How long do you anticipate these sessions will last?  The expected length of sessions is approximately 1-2 hours.  How many attendees to you anticipate averaging at a session? 10-16.

11. How many Group Coaching sessions do you anticipate over the course of a year?  Approximately 2-6 sessions.

12. What is the design of the EPA 360 instrument - number of categories and headings, and total number of questions?  EPA's in house 360 instrument has 48 questions and is tied to the Region's  Core Values (STOCKCAR - Service, Taking Initiative, Open Communication, Commitment & Vision, Knowledge, Character, Accountability and Risk Taking). 

13. Is the coach expected to provide the guidelines for the development planning process, e.g. forms, etc.?  The coach is expected to provide some guidelines for the development planning process and to work closely with EPA?s senior managers in developing this process.

<CONTACT>Robert Egan, (309) 782-1547
<DESC>The following questions have been raised by a potential offeror.  In an effort to insure that all potential offerors have the same information from the Government, responses to the potential offeror's are provided herewith: Question #1: How does an interested prospective offeror acquire the TDP to be in compliance with the listed specifications for the M16A4? Government Answer: At solicitation issue, every interested prospective offeror will be directed to submit a pair of Non-Disclosure Agreements, as the end item is subject to proprietary licensing agreements between the US Government and two suppliers.  Once I receive properly  completed Non-Disclosure Statements endorsed by a representative authorized to bind prospective offerors, I will direct that the Technical Data Package (TDP) be sent on CD-Rom via surface mail.  If a potential offeror desires to have the mailing of this T DP expedited, potential offerors should include their FEDEX Account # when submitting a properly completed Non-Disclosure statement(s). Question #2: Are there any deviations permitted to the specs? Government Answer: No.  Every offeror must quote to the Government specification(s) as published.  Potential offerors cannot quote assuming that the Government would approve of any request for deviation (RFD) as submitted by an offeror.  During the open solicitation period, engineering questions raised by potential offerors are encouraged and will be published as Questions and Answers in the form of material amendments to the solicitation.  This process alerts ALL potential offerors to information that could affect how a pote ntial offeror responds to both non-price and pricing-related solicitation requirements. However, if an offeror becomes a subsequent awardee and then finds the necessity to submit a Request for Deviation following award, there is a method in place to support that process. Question #3: The solicitation release date has been modified to July 31, 2007.  Is this the date when we may begin to send the necessary documentation for this solicitation? Government Answer: The solicitation release date as announced on FedBizOpps is an ESTIMATED release date.  If you have already activated the automatic email notification that FedBizOpps allows in connection with any solicitation, you will receive automatic notification of th e solicitation release.  The Government does not maintain an interested bidder list, and it is incumbent on industry to monitor our Open Solicitation website for the actual publication of the solicitation. On issue, potential offerors may download the solicitation and its associated attachments.  It is at that point that potential offerors can submit their properly completed Non-Disclosure Statements (see Question/Answer #1). Question #4: When does the solicitation close? Government Answer: The solicitation will carry a clear closing date when issued.  That date will be NO LESS than thirty days from the original issue date.  Potential offerors are strongly encouraged to continuously monitor our Open Solicitation website for material amendment s that may be published while the solicitation is open for industry response.  Some of these amendments may extend the original closing date. NOTE 2 applies.

<SUBJECT>S -- Creech Air Force Base Wastewater System Privatization
<SOLNBR>GS-00P-07-BSC-0531
<RESPDATE>081007
<ARCHDATE>08102008
<CONTACT>Linda Collins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 708-9881, Fax (202) 205-5049, Email lindal.collins@gsa.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE: The Air Force seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority".  The Air Force is seeking interest and information specifically for the potential privatization of the wastewater utility system at Creech AFB, NV.  Creech AFB is located 45 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV.  The wastewater collected at Creech AFB will be discharged to Clark County sewer system for treatment at its wastewater treatment facility.  The system includes 21,798 LF of sanitary sewer mains on the base, 4 sewage pumping stations and a small amount of force main piping. The description provided is only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the utility system being considered for privatization.  The system parameters are approximations and subject to change. Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.

OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization result in the ownership of the Creech AFB wastewater collection system, operation and maintenance and obligation to continue to provide utility service for an indefinite and ongoing period will transfer to the successful offeror.  All responsibility for providing 24/7 response and maintaining reliable utility service, including such items as, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead costs will become the utility service provider's responsibility.  It is intended that the privatization will ultimately reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services.

REQUESTED RESPONSE:  Qualified parties interested in acquiring the Creech AFB wastewater collection system should provide a statement of interest which includes: the Company name, address, email address and phone number for your point of contact.  Also include a description (no more than two pages) of the firm?s capabilities, qualifications, experience and resources available for this utility system.  Please respond electronically at lindal.collins@gsa.gov or by hard copy to Linda Collins, Director, Natural Gas Acquisition Program, GSA Energy Center of Expertise, 301 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20407-001, no later than 10 August 2007.

When determining interest in acquiring the utility system at an Air Force Base, the Air Force Request for Proposal (RFP) template documents must be considered.  The government intends to issue Requests for Proposal documents similar to those posted at the following web site:  http://www.afcesa.af.mil/cei/ceiu/ceiu_templates.asp.

This request for interested parties is for gathering information and is a required component of a systematic process to evaluate the interested qualified parties under the Air Force Utilities Privatization Program.  To minimize costs to both potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal RFP.  This Request for Interest is not a guarantee on the part of the government that a formal solicitation will be issued

<DESC>JT3, at Edwards AFB, is seeking a vendor to enhance its existing Global Positioning System (GPS) - Aided Inertial Navigation Reference (GAINR) Lite (GLite) System.  The GLite System is designed to capture and record real time navigation data while in flight.

The GLite system, developed by the Time Space Position Information (TSPI) department of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Range Division, provides a modular platform for the use of a variety of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors.  The GLite Configuration 2-B (C2B) integrates and Novatel OEM-V GPS receiver, the Honeywell Ring-Laser-Gyro HG1700AG58 IMU, and various other Commercial Off-The-Shelf products to record GPS/IMU data, produce a GPS/IMU blended solution in real-time, and interface with various monitors and controls devices.  The unit records measurements, the trajectory solution, and status information to removable media, or sends this information to a serial port for recording by an external device.

There is now a need for fully flight certified unit with the capabilities of the GLite C2B.  The goal of this effort is to produce a certified unit that meets military flight specifications and provides all of the GLite C2B capabilities along with some modest enhancements.

If you are interested in receiving the Request for Proposal, please provide your company address, phone number and fax number and send the email to:  tillie.rivera.ctr@edwards.af.mil.  Request for Proposals will be sent out no sooner than 30 July 2007.  No request for proposals will be considered after 27 July 2007.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The repository shall allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and, perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.

The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Receive blood samples from NIDK funded grants and contracts
?	Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples
?	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and
?	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats

The cell immortalization and other tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise.  The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable.  It depends, in large measure, on how well the established methods are implemented.  As the entire value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of sib-pairs and other relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples.  Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible.  Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Rutgers University Cell & DNA Repository.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;

2)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;

3)	Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;

4)	Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 97% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;

5)	Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;

6)	Cryopreserve blood cells for eventual transformation and/or DNA extraction;

7)	Extract and store DNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells and, with designated samples, separating the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma;

8)	Receive externally produced DNA;

9)	Carry out whole genome amplification, pedigree analyses and RNA extraction;

10)	 Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the PO, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;

11)	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;

12)	 Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;

13)	 Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;

14)	 Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository; and

15)	 Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Biosample Repository. The repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner.  This facilitates sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields.  It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.
 
The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner: 

?	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies, 
?	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and
?	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators

The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The samples were collected over several years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity.  Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated.  Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and distributes aliquots to many different investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.

NUMBER OF STUDIES
This project will potentially serve fifteen or more large multi-site NIDDK funded studies. 

The range for existing samples is 200,000 to 400,000 individual vials. In addition, to 20,000 to 60,000 new samples, in multiple aliquots (5 ? 20 vials), will be received annually.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Fisher Bioservices.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

?	Carry out activities to advertise to the research community about the availability of samples and data

The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators over five or more years to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members.  The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and, therefore, it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful database management.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS?s.  As all the work is with data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.

Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Research Triangle Insitute.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Receive and test the accuracy, completeness and validity of electronic databases of participant information from completed studies that include clinical, diagnostic, genotypic, pedigree structure and other data, along with supporting documentation;

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), Global Monitoring Division (GMD) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Aero-Laser, GMBH, Unterfieldstrasse 12, d-82467, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany for two analyzers that measure carbon monoxide (CO) with linear response over the range of atmospheric CO (40 to 500 parts per billion [ppb]), a precision of at least 1 percent, low maintenance and long-term reproducibility. 
Sole source determination is based on NOAA's experience showing that CO analyzers based upon chemical fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) provide the most precise and accurate measurements.  The gas chromatography-HgO reduction analyzer tested is useful for good precision and low detection limit, however, it also has a non-linear response and the response characteristics change with time which makes it difficult to accurately calibrate over a long period of time. Non-dispersive Infrared detectors cannot provide the necessary precision within required analysis period. Tunable Diode Laser spectroscopy require high maintenance and are not considered suitable for remote measurements.
Delivery shall be FOB destination, Boulder CO and is required 120 days ARO.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.
No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can meet the Government's requirements may submit their capabilities in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Information submitted will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Pole 
Zero Corporation, 5530 Union Centre Drive, West Chester, OH 45069 for several narrowband electronic tunable RF bandpass filters to be used to build the low frequency preselector for the 4th generation Radio Spectrum Measurement System.  These filters will prevent strong off-tuned signals from overloading the front-end Low Noise Amplifiers.

Sole Source determination is based on NTIA's market research.  Very few manufacturers make this type of product and the few that do, do not cover all the frequency ranges required (low band 1.5 to 30 MHz).

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Boulder, CO, and is required within 45 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334220, and the size standard is 750 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 08, 2007 in making the final sole source determination.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The assistance of a Contractor is needed to research and report on the range of different methods used by States to implement and enforce accessibility requirements in state building codes or other accessibility codes.  The focus of this project is: states that have adopted innovative models of accessibility compliance that are proactive rather than punitive.  Unique models may include: specially designated staff or contractor programs to conduct plans review and on-site inspections; focused training in accessibility; professional credentialing for accessibility specialists or building officials; a uniquely qualified body to resolve questions of interpretation or other accessibility-related enforcement matters; or other approaches.  The project should provide a detailed review of each model.   

Tasks 
The Contractor shall survey State approaches to accessibility code implementation and enforcement nationwide and report the findings, highlighting particular approaches of interest for their effectiveness and/or innovation.  In collaboration with government agency staff, the Contractor shall then select at least five (5) states for which more detailed information will be developed describing their implementation programs, enforcement model, personnel qualifications, training methodologies, and other features.  The Contractor shall submit a draft of the findings to the government agency for review and approval prior to final documentation.  The final report will signal project completion.   

All materials developed are in the public domain.  Contractors may not copyright or otherwise seek ownership or exclusive use of contract products and deliverables.  Draft and final documentation shall be in accessible formats.

The Contractor shall provide all required documents as electronic files in standard print in MS Word 2002.  Provide all drawings, figures, charts, photographs, and graphics separately as non-imbedded files in GIF or JPEG format.  Supply all drawings, figures, charts, photographs, and graphics with text descriptions in MS Word 2002 as separate non-imbedded files (see http://www.access-board.gov/research&training/pedsignals/pedestrian.htm for examples of descriptions).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR PLANT (NGNP) DESIGN DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NGNP PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCE PROCESS HEAT, HYDROGEN, AND ELECTRICITY AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY (INL)

I.	BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION 

The Department of Energy has selected the Idaho National Laboratory as the lead national laboratory for nuclear energy research. Per the terms of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Title VI, Subtitle C, Section 642, INL, under the direction of the DOE, will lead the development of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) by integrating, conducting, and coordinating all necessary research and development activities and by organizing project participants.  INL, as the Managing Contractor, will be responsible for conducting project related procurements and coordinating project efforts with industry and the international community.

Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), Management & Operating Contractor of the INL, is requesting an expression of interest from prospective subcontractors (teams, consortiums, joint ventures, etc.) that are capable of providing complete and comprehensive Engineering Services for Design Development (DD) for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant prototype that produces very high temperature heat, hydrogen, and electricity.

In FY 2007, BEA subcontracted engineering studies and preconceptual design activities with three design teams led by Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC, AREVA NP, Inc. and General Atomics.  A total of 26 companies participated in this design work.  In addition to the reports prepared by each of these teams, a consolidated and integrated Preconceptual Design Report will be issued in September 2007 based on this design work.


II.	PURPOSE

In FY 2008, BEA is planning to continue design development by performing selected further studies and proceeding with conceptual design.  This work will support progressive selection of NGNP prototype functional requirements, design features and configuration, and refinement of cost and schedule estimates.  Functional, operational, and design requirements included in the Preconceptual Design Report will be used as the starting point for these design activities.


III.	REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

BEA requests an expression of interest from qualified potential subcontractors to perform this work.  The specific scope of work will be developed as part of an extension of current subcontracts or selection for a subcontract with BEA and will depend on available funding, design and technology risk characterization from preconceptual design work, and the capabilities of the interested potential subcontractors.

The three design teams that performed preconceptual design activities and provided engineering services in FY 2007 are requested to provide a confirmation of interest in performing these design development services and confirm the makeup of the teams.  Extension of existing subcontracts is anticipated if existing subcontractors remain interested.  However, as appropriate, other subcontracts may be awarded.  To that end, additional prospective subcontractors with interest in performing such design and engineering services are requested to provide a summary submittal of qualifications in accordance with section IV Submittal Requirements.
 
 
IV.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS

Prospective subcontractors shall provide brief statements of qualifications in the following areas:

1)	A description of current knowledge or capabilities related to Pebble Bed and Prismatic gas cooled graphite moderated reactor system designs, hydrogen plant design, and balance of plant design.

2)	Demonstrated ability to integrate specialty disciplines and industry expertise to provide for an integrated design for a prototype reactor, power generation, and hydrogen production plant.  Specialties shall include but not be limited to reactor design, Brayton and steam cycle turbomachinery, controls, hydrogen production, and balance of plant engineering and design.

3)	The prospective subcontractor must also be able to effectively identify and evaluate technology development status and needs. 

4)	A minimum of three references who represent a direct client of the lead team member that can validate past history regarding reactor engineering and design services, ability to assemble and integrate highly specialized design elements, and performance satisfaction. 

5)	An indication of whether the prospective subcontractor possesses the capability to design a commercial scale prototype NGNP modular reactor, including examples of past design efforts. 

6)	A statement to describe the prospective subcontractor's Quality Program Plan with a discussion on how it is qualified to ASME NQA-1, 2000, requirements for engineering design services.  

7)	Demonstrated experience in licensing nuclear plants for construction and operation with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission .

Failure to provide the requisite submittals may limit a prospective subcontractor's ability in being a viable candidate for a future Request for Proposal.

Again, it is the intent of this expression of interest to develop a representative list of qualified prospective subcontractors that can and will provide all submittal requirements identified within this EOI, as well as possess the interest, the resources, and capabilities to cooperatively and successfully perform the required tasks.

Please provide your expression of interest to the undersigned by 5 p.m. Mountain Time, August 20, 2007.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Greg Anderson on Extension (208) 526-1816 or email gregory.anderson @inl.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. mail or email).

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is conducting market research to identify interested organizations with the capability to implement a time-definite mail distribution and transportation network.  A synopsis of the network is described in this document. 

The synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not in any way constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) cannot be accepted by USPS to form a binding contract nor will USPS pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI.  The RFI provides an opportunity for industry to comment on this initiative, identify potential areas of opportunity, and make alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for a turnkey network service option (as described herein).  The Postal Service believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to ideas from industry which will result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technological solutions that could be applied to the concept.

<DESC>This document is the Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Financial Management (OFM) Performance Management Support Services (PMSS) procurement.  The purpose of this SIR is to request information from offerors regarding their capabilities with respect to the requirements of the TSA for the PMSS procurement.  This procurement will be conducted as a 100% small business set-aside.  All qualified, eligible, responsible small business may respond.


The Office of Financial Management seeks to obtain support to further the goals and objectives of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer in four task areas: 1) Policy maintenance and support; 2) Balanced Scorecard development; 3) Web page publication and maintenance; and 4) Travel Card program financial support services.


TSA OFM anticipates that the work performed to fulfill these requirements will be valued in excess of $1,000,000 per year over a five year period consisting of a base year and four one-year option periods (this is an estimate of anticipated value only and in no way binds or commits the TSA to make any contract award at any specific dollar value).  The TSA expects that the services performed for this requirement will be firm fixed-price but with cost reimbursement contract line items for Other Direct Costs and/or Travel if necessary.

<SUBJECT>99--Beneficial Use of Dredged Material
<SOLNBR>W912HN-07-S-PW01
<RESPDATE>083007
<ARCHDATE>10292007
<CONTACT>Jenifer M. Bordelon, 910-251-4116
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice for Beneficial Use of Dredged Material (Unrestricted). This sources sought synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. This is not a sol icitation announcement; this is a sources sought request. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), Wilmington District, is updating the Dredged Material Management Plan (DMMP) for the federally authorized Wilmington Harbor navigation project. The purpose o f the DMMP is to determine appropriate methods of disposing of material from required maintenance dredging for a twenty year period beginning in 2011. To assist in preparation of the DMMP, this notice is being sent to determine if there is Contractor inter est in the beneficial use of the dredged material disposed of in the Eagle Island Confined Disposal Facility (EICDF). Approximately 1.5 million cubic yards is disposed of annually in the EICDF. The EICDF is 774 acres divided into three diked cells. It is l ocated on the peninsula between the Brunswick and Cape Fear Rivers south of Highway 17. It is across the Cape Fear River from the NC State Ports south of downtown Wilmington, NC. The material in the EICDF is generated by dredging the authorized channels in the Cape Fear River from Lower Brunswick to the confluence with the Northeast Cape Fear River and the Northeast Cape Fear River up to 750 feet above the Hilton Railroad Bridge. T he dredged material disposed in EICDF is best described as unclassified material which may consist of dredged rock fragments (3 to 12) and soils ranging from coarse sand to silt and clay. The fine material (silts and clays) consists of minimal organic co ntent when dredged and retains a high content of water within the soil structure. Typically within a year of disposal the surface waters will be drained and a 6-8 inch layer of mostly dry material will form with the underlying soils remaining in a highly s aturated state. It is this fine material that is the majority of material available for removal. Material removal could be done only at times and locations specified by the Government. Material could not be excavated from any portion of the existing earth dikes, berms, or cross-dikes, nor from within a 50 foot minimum distance from the toe of any existing dike or berm. Upon completion of material removal the contractor would be required to insure positive site drainage to the existing spillway structures. T here shall be controlled ingress/egress routes in each cell of the EICDF to minimize impacts to the dike structures. It is expected the sediments would be provided at nominal or no charge and; once removed, would become the property of the Contractor.   The Government intends to use most of the coarse material in cell 1 and some of the dried fine material in cells 1 and/or 2 for planned dike construction. Some of the material within has been chemically tested. Test results can be made available by calling  Ms. Jenny Owens at 910-251-4757. Due diligence should be used to ensure that the material characteristics are appropriate for the intended use of the material. A large part of the Eagle Island disposal area is covered with Phragmites and other weeds. Tran sportation of viable Phragmites rhizomes or plant segments to other areas where it can grow and become invasive is not acceptable. Weed control, removal, and disposal and consideration of the potential for weed contamination in the material removed will be  required. Contractor site visits may be arranged by calling Ms. Jenny Owens. Recognizing the above, the COE is requesting a letter reply from contractors interested in the dredged material that exists in the EICDF beginning no earlier than 2011. Responses should include the following information: the company name, address, phone nu mber, history and experience. The COE is also interested in Contractor ideas on methods for economically removing the material and the follow on benefi cial uses of the material. Responses to this market research will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.   This notice is to determine contractor interest and is not a request for formal technical plans or cost proposals for any such plans. Responses to this sources sought shall be mailed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington Contracting Office, 69 Da rlington Avenue (PO Box 1890) Wilmington, NC 28403, to the Attention of Ms. Jenifer Bordelon. Please note the solicitation number on each page. Responses must be received no later than 30 August 2007, 4:00 p.m. local time.

<SUBJECT>--Process Capability Control and Improvement (PCCI)
<DESC>A Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) joint services team is proposing under an effort to implement a higher level system for Supplier Quality (SQ) to replace local / non standard clauses used in the procurement of m unitions and munitions related items with a single, integrated clause to be used throughout the JM&L LCMC. The local / non standard clauses to be replaced are referenced in common (or standardized) contractual language used by Joint Munitions Command (JMC) , Rock Island Arsenal and Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal. For the effort outlined here-in the JMC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as (ES6031) First Article Test (Contractor testing) (May 1994) , (ES6033) First Article Test (Government testing) (May 1994), and the corresponding ARDEC clauses to be replaced are currently referenced as ARDEC 39 and ARDEC 40 - First Article Test (FAT). There may be other tailored, program unique variations of these clauses that are intended to be replaced as well. The new clause will combine the currently separate clauses for contractor and Government first article tests. The new non-standard FAT clause will be a stand alone clause which will be supportive of other recently revised clauses such as the PCCI and CCC c lauses.  The proposed FAT clause allows it to be adapted to program needs. A significant change from prior FAT requirements is the stated supplier flow down aspect of the clause and a shift in emphasis to a stated requirement for conforming first article i tems to be produced using capable processes on the intended production equipment, at the intended production rate. The FAT Clause also outlines trigger events, which the government may use to require additional FAT tests to be conducted. New to the list of  trigger events are changes in rate of production, addition of shifts, line change over, changes in environment, and key personnel turnover. Previous trigger events are retained and clarified, specifically location of performance changes.  FAT requirements  are intended to reduce the risk to both the government and the contractor by establishing the capability to consistently produce conforming products using established processes and defined equipment or procedures. The government is seeking input from indu stry relative to this effort and encourages participation and comments by interested suppliers. Questions, comments and feedback on the proposed FAT requirements change should be directed to the government POC listed below.

3.  Customer Satisfaction - Vendor provided information includes positive reports from past government or commercial contracts as well as the names and phone numbers of references/contacts for contracts cited.

Factor 5: Price

Offerors proposals will be evaluated to determine completeness and price reasonableness.  Completeness means that offerors have complied with all solicitation requirements including those in the "Instructions to Offerors" section.  Offerors who fail to comply with all solicitation submittal requirements or who fail to account for significant portions of the technical proposal within their price proposal may have their proposals rejected and no longer considered for award.  

Price reasonableness will be determined on the basis of adequate price competition and by comparing offerors' proposed overall total price for the basic IDIQ contract.  If adequate price competition is not present, the overall proposed price will be compared to the Independent Government Estimate and the labor rates will be compared to commercial prices for similar labor categories.  Unrealistically high or low labor rates could be construed as "unreasonable" if these rates are significantly above or below the "*market price", paid for these labor categories.  In such cases, offerors may be requested to provide additional rationale and support for the proposed rates.

 *Market Price is defined as the actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold in a definable market.  If a sale has not occurred for some time, the market price may be assumed to be the price a seller would be prepared to accept and the price a buyer would be prepared to pay.

The initial task orders price and all other task order prices under the basic IDIQ contract shall be evaluated separately based on the level of effort and labor mix.  The initial task order pricing will not be evaluated as part of the contract price.

In addition the following price sub-factors will be evaluated.

Price Sub Factors
1. Equipment Price - Vendor provided costs for radios are competitive based on features provided, product quality, and warranty support.
2.  Accessory Price - Vendor provided costs for accessories are competitive based on features provided, product quality and warranty support.

Other areas to be reviewed:

Trade-Off: 

The Government will apply a trade-off process under Best Value Continuum procedures to determine which offeror presents the best value to the government.  As such, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Proposals shall be evaluated on their merits pertaining to the evaluation factors described below. 

Risk Assessment:

The Government will perform a risk assessment of each offeror?s proposal for all evaluation factors.  The proposal risk assessment will focus on the probability of success or failure of performance of the solicitation requirements as proposed by the offeror and consider the potential for schedule disruption, increased cost, degradation of performance and the need for increased Government oversight.  For each proposal risk identified by the Government, the evaluation assessment will also address the offeror's proposed plan to mitigate said risk and why the plan is or is not sufficient.   

The importances of all non-price factors above are in descending order of importance and, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Total contract ceiling price will be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1b. The total contract ceiling is derived by multiplying the maximum FFP quantities by their respective unit prices. Evaluation of the option periods shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offerors are required to submit at least 3 Relevant Past Performance references. Current, accurate, complete information MUST be provided to contact each reference. This should include contract number, point of contact, phone number and email address for each contact.

USCG HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET 
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
ENGINE MOUNTS
 
1.0	Background 
1.1	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (DFJ).  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; USCG HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components.  The USCG typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year and inspects them in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG-Specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  This Performance work statement (PWS) establishes the minimum requirements necessary to inspect, repair and return HU-25 engine mounts to service.  Inspection and repair shall meet OEM specifications and USCG approved procedures from the applicable documents in 3.0.   The USCG does not own and cannot provide OEM specifications.  
1.2	All USCG HU-25 engine mounts are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  Engine mounts are completely inspected at least every five years, which requires chemical removal of Sermetel coatings, inspection for corrosion and damage, corrosion and damage removal by specialized machining or blending, non destructive testing, and reapplication of Sermetel coatings.  The manufacture and installation of bushings shall be accomplished, as necessary, IAW USCG requirements.  Inspections and repairs are performed IAW USCG provided requirements and OEM tolerances from the applicable documents in 3.0.   The USCG does not own and cannot provide OEM specifications; however, the USCG can provide minimum and maximum tolerances for development of contractor inspection repair procedures.  Engine mount measurements that exceed the provided tolerances must be sufficiently documented and provided via a damage map, to the USCG and ultimately for DFJ evaluation and disposition.
1.3	Engine Mount Configurations
Note: Engine mount PNs are determined by the spigot dimensions IAW USCG provided technical data.

9.2.4.1.1	Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established to the extent practicable by the existence of adequate competition, by comparison of all or a representative sample of proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or price/cost from other contracts for similar work.
9.2.4.1.2	Realism: If it is determined that a realism assessment is needed, it may be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLN/sub-CLN in the prospective offeror?s quoted cost/price.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the quoted price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the technical submission.  The price quoted should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation (e.g. work breakdown structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.
9.2.4.1.3	Provide separate cost breakdowns inclusive of parts and labor for each level of service.
9.3	Evaluation
9.3.1	The USCG intends to award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the reasonable offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and will be most advantageous and best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The USCG may determine the best value which merits higher price based on technical superiority.  The USCG using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal?s relative capability as measured against the source selection criteria below.
9.3.1.1	Factor 1- Technical
9.3.1.2	Factor 2- Performance Plan
9.3.1.3	Factor 3- Past performance
9.3.1.4	Factor 4- Cost/Price
9.3.2	Factors 1, 2, and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical and performance factors approach equal.
10.0	F.O.B. Point
10.1	F.O.B. Destination is preferred.

Desired Delivery is 60 calendar days after receipt of order.    The COC is to be attached to the original invoice when submitted to the payment office.  Failure to do so will result in either nonpayment or a delay in payment.  

THE COAST GUARD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A SITE SURVEY OF THE CONTRACTOR?S AND SUB-CONTRACTOR?S CAPABILITIES.

    (a) Prohibitions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.   Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

1.1	Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests
                                                                                                

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

 (4)  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition   
 The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 
10 USC 2304(c)(1) implement by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements?.

     (5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited.  The material to be procured is manufactured by a foreign manufacturer, Eurocopter S.A.S., Aeroport International, De Marseille-Province, 13725 Margnane Cedex. France.  Eurocopter, France is also the manufacturer of the USCG HH-65 aircraft.  Eurocopter , France sole designed, developed and produced the equipment and its technical requirements for 



maintenance and support equipment used in the HH-65 maintenance effort.   Eurocopter, France owns all rights to proprietary data, specifications and drawings. The US Coast Guard does not own, or have data rights for this peculiar support equipment.  
 
American Eurocopter LLC, 2701 Form Drive, Grand Prairie, Texas is the manufacturer's North American subsidiary and provides distribution of Eurocopter S.A.S. France products, services and fleet support.  There are, however, U.S. affiliates and distributors who may be able to propose on one or more of the parts to be procured.  For aircraft operational safety, the part numbers listed in these requirements are the only part numbers approved for use on the HH65  aircraft.  This prohibits consideration of a part number manufactured by other companies within the U.S. or from foreign vendors other than the OEM.    

    (6)  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  ? A combined snyopsis/solicitation for this requirement will be submitted to FedBizOpps for potential offerors.  If any responses are received as a result of the solicitation, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors.

    (7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  - The contracting officer determines that the anticipated prices will be fair and reasonable based on   comparison with historical pricing, comparison to market prices for similar items, commercial catalog prices and the Government estimate.

    (8)  Description of Market Research. ? Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the HH65 spare parts.  In addition to American Eurocopter, LLC (the approved foreign manufacturer's distributor) other brokers and/or vendors in the past have provided a limited quantity Eurocopter S.A.S., France parts.  These firms are Sey Tech, Inc., Hurst, TX and Boone Air Parts, Valencia CA.  The items to be procured meet the commercial item definition and many of the parts are listed in American Eurocopter, LLC's 2007 commercial catalog.

    (9)  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition. -  Since the U.S. Coast Guard did not purchase the technical rights as part of the original acquisition for the HH65 aircraft and the necessary manufacturing drawings, data and special tooling information is proprietary and available only to the foreign OEM, Eurocopter S.A.S., France.  Eurocopter, France will not release or provide copies drawings for the purpose of reverse engineering or to permit another manufacturer to duplicate the design(s) and remanufacture under a different part number.  Additionally, the Coast Guard has on file a letter from American Eurocopter LLC, Texas dated March 14, 2007 stating that they are the only approved source of supply for Eurocopter products for the HH65 aircraft.  They further state they are the only authorized source to sell these parts in North American and cannot be held liable, provide part 



certification documents, or provide Warranty for Eurocopter parts purchased from brokers or other vendors (See Attachment B letter from American Eurocopter LLC, Texas).
 
    (10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for the required items will be advertised in FedBizOpps.

    (11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required.  Completed specifications and technical drawings for HH65 aircraft parts and maintenance support products are not available to the Coast Guard.  However, in an effort to increase competition HH65 Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows and performs extensive research to identify other potential sources of supply.  Procurements for Eurocopter France material are advertised in FedBizOpps.  In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center established the New Product Development Branch (NPD) of which a representative is assigned to the HH65 Product Line for the purpose of identifying potential sources in the effort to remove barriers to competition.  The NPD representative has the responsibility to identify and locate alternate sources of supply/services and suitable substitute parts.  

(12)	Contracting Officer?s Certification
I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Response:  Yes, the intent is that this training effort will be divided into two separate classes, with separate participants; one class (i.e., Change Management Certification Program) will last three days and the other class (i.e., Change Management Coaching Program for Managers and Supervisors) will last one day. A total of four (4) days of training.

2.  In order to calculate the cost of the work, approximately how many people are expected to attend the training?

Response:  As stated above, the expected number of people in each class is as follows:  twelve participants in the Change Management Certification Program class and thirty participants in the Change Management Coaching Program for Managers and Supervisors class. 


3.  How many times are you looking to deliver each
program?

Response:  Each course would be delivered one time.

4. In section C.4.7. in the Amendment the solicitation states "All material
and information gathered and developed in the performance of the tasks
listed in the contract shall be the property of the U.S. Government."  Does
this mean that your Organization wants to own the curriculum used in the
training?

Response:  No, NRC does not intend to own the curriculum; however NRC expects to own the information that is provided to the participants as part of the training. The copyrighted content in the material do not become the property of the U.S. Government.

5. In section C.3.2. in the Amendment the solicitation states that the
students will be expected to complete course work based on current or
upcoming project they are working on. Will the trainer be able to see this
pre-work prior to the training for preparation purposes?

Response: As stated in the SOW, ?in order to prepare for the class, there will be pre-course work required.?  It will be at the discretion of the Contractor whether or not the trainer will need to see this pre-course work prior to the actual meeting of the class.  This will depend on the trainer?s teaching methodology. 

6. In section C.8. in the Amendment the solicitation states what materials
will be provided by the vendor. The list does not explicitly state that a
LCD projector or projection screen will be provided. Will these materials be
provided, or will the trainer have to furnish their own?

Response:  Yes, an LCD projector and projection screen will be provided, however, it will be the responsibility of the Contractor to coordinate these particular requests with the NRC Project Officer.

7.  What are the actual required dates for training? (Do you know what dates the training will be held on?)

Response:   In C.4.2, the SOW states that within (7) day of the receipt of the Delivery order, the Contractor shall contact the Project Officer to discuss reserving a room to hold the training.  The dates of the training will be based upon the availability of classrooms at the NRC?s Training Center in Bethesda, MD.  As stated in C.5, the period of performance is nine months from the date of contract award.

8.      Does the OIS have a clear understanding of what the NRC needs in the
way of information technology? (strategy?)

Response:  A pre-meeting or conference call can be arranged between NRC Project Officer and the Contractor in order to answer questions about OIS responsibilities.  This effort is not necessarily related to information technology needs, but rather to prepare managers who will lead employees to confront change and to build change management competency within NRC OIS.  

9.      Have they identified specific gaps in delivering what the NRC needs?
(gaps in results and performance?)

Response:   NRC OIS is a process oriented organization which is consistently evaluating performance and measuring results.  From the perspective of improving the pending implementation phases of OIS? varied programs and systems, the goal of this training is to introduce and explain a solid methodology for helping managers help employees adopt to changes, which will accompany the introduction of new programs and systems.  

10.      Have they looked at and understand the causes for the gaps? (both
technological and culture oriented?)

Response:  NRC OIS has just completed Covey training (open to all employees), which helped both employees and management understand some reasons for performance gaps within the organization.  Over the past few years, staff has been resistant to change because of a number of factors (multiple changes in leadership ? changes in the Director of OIS, hiring contractors over existing employees at higher grades, high employee turnover, etc.)  The scope of this effort is to develop change management capability within NRC OIS.  

11.      What specific changes in staff behavior must occur to close the
performance gaps? (this is the crux of the situation)

Response:  It is not the intent of this effort to completely change staff behavior; to achieve this goal would go well beyond the scope of this effort. However, the purpose is to introduce and/or teach students (depending on which class they are taking) a structured methodology which they can use as a tool in their challenge of leading employees though the various aspects of change which OIS is confronting as a result of the implementation of several new programs and systems.  

12.      Do they have a clear idea of the tangible results they'd expect to
see in OIS operations in 60 days, 90 days, 1 year, etc?

Response:  OIS senior management expects that the implementation of many of OIS? programs and systems will be more effective (i.e., run smoother) as a result of this training.  They will share some of these goals with the contractor upon award of the contract. 

13.  All material and information gathered and developed in the performance of the tasks listed in the contract shall be the property of the U.S. Government.  

Response: All material and information gathered and developed (i.e., handouts, textbooks, workbooks, and other supplemental training materials provided to the student for use in the training) become the property of the U.S. Government. As stated above, the copyrighted content in the material do not become the property of the U.S. Government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATION SB1341-07-RQ-0293
AMENDMENT #0001

The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions, and extend the due date for quotes.

(1)  The following responses are provided to technical questions submitted: 

QUESTION 1:  Can you provide more information regarding mechanical or electrical integration of the two devices? For example, are there physical constraints on how the devices are to be mounted, or limits on their footprint?

ANSWER 1:

LINE ITEM #1, MECHANICAL
Line Item #1 must be small enough to be mounted within the 2.5x3.75 inch footprint of a Newport 562XYZ manual positioning stage.

Samples to be analyzed in the Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) instrument, typically semiconductor wafers or wafer pieces, will be mounted on the top surface of Item #1.  As stated in our specification (10), Item #1 must be large enough to accommodate a 25 x 25 mm sample.

LINE ITEM #1, ELECTRICAL
As stated in our advertised specs (7) and (9), the open loop Z-positioner shall be controllable by an externally provided analog voltage source, and response of the Z-positioner to this external voltage shall be between 2 micron/volt and 20/micron/volt.  We can further state that the external analog voltage source will be an output of a National Instruments Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board programmable via National Instruments Labview.

LINE ITEM #2, MECHANICAL
Line Item #2 will be mounted on the bottom surface of the upper frame of the TERS instrument; the upper frame is being designed in-house at NIST.  Item #2 must be small enough to meet our advertised spec (9) that the lowest mechanical resonance frequency shall be 60 kHz or greater (this sets an upper limit to the size, because the lowest resonance frequency decreases with increasing size).  Item #2 must be large enough to meet our advertised spec (10) that "the surface area in the XY plane ... available for mounting a probe tip and associated parts, shall be at least 4 x 4 mm".  We can further state that the part of the probe tip assembly that will be attached to Item #2 is a quartz crystal tuning-fork resonator of the type commonly used in wristwatches.

LINE ITEM #2, ELECTRICAL
See our advertised specs (3), (4), (7), (8) for control voltage inputs to the X actuator (full range = 4 micron), Y actuator (full range = 4 micron), and X oscillation actuator (full range = 10 nm at frequencies from DC to at least 35 kHz).  We can further state that the external voltage sources for the X and Y (4 micron) actuators will be outputs of a National Instruments Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board, and the external voltage source for the X oscillation actuator (10 nm, DC - 35 kHz) will be the probe drive output of an RHK PLLPro AFM controller.

QUESTION 2:  What is the motivation for open loop control of the z axis for line item #1? Is it intended to be operated in this mode for lower noise, faster response time or some other reason?

ANSWER 2:  Motivation for open-loop control of Z in Item 1:  The Z position will be set via a control loop that is part of the overall TERS instrument, but external to Items 1 and 2 in this solicitation.

QUESTION 3:  Is the range of travel indicated above appropriate for your application?

ANSWER 3:  We require a minimum of 30 micron travel in the Z direction, as stated in our advertised specification (2) for Item #1.

(4)  The due date for quotations is hereby changed to read as follows:  FROM:  Wednesday, July 18, 2007 at 3:30 PM EST, TO: Thursday, July 26, 2007 at 3:30 PM EST.

Provided by Aberdeen Test Center. d. Is there an urban training area where practical training scenarios, including explosive detonations, can be supported?  A.  Non-live post blast training is supported by various locations at APG outside the security area.  Ranges are provided by Aberdeen Test Center. (2) Will the government provide inert UXO training aids (e.g. projectiles, mines, bombs, grenades, etc) or is the contractor responsible for these items?   A.  Contractors responsibility but some are still available from previous rotations (i.e. inert 155 rounds). (3) What is the acceptable instructor-to-student ratio for classroom instruction, and for practical exercises?   A.  30-40 per class. (4) What is the MOS of the students attending training?   A.  Army combat arms, Air Force Intel, AF EOD and AF Combat Camera. (5) During practical exercises, will the class be organized by standard WIT team composition? If so, what is the standard WIT/WIS organizational structure?  A. Currently trained as Five person WITs. (6) If more than one class is held concurrently, will all the classes be held in the same location (base)?  A. Yes currently at APG.  Future classes may be at Fort Huachuca, or Iraq or Afghanistan. (7) IAW the SOW states that the contractor shall integrate US Government personnel into their POI as assistant instructors for the purpose of future transition to a military instructor-based cadre (i.e. train the trainer). How many US Government-provided A Is will be made available to support training during each training rotation?  A.  8 to 12. (8) Is the contractor required to train US Government assistant instructors prior to the 1st WIT class? If so, what is the anticipated number of students?   A.  No.  The assistant instructors will OJT by sitting in on the first several classes and assume increasing responsibilities during later classes.  The contractor must provide their complete instructor POI for this purpose. (9) What is the Military Occupational Skill (MOS) of US Government-provided assistant instructors?   A.  Most of the AIs for the upcoming Phase of instruction are Iraq WIT veterans with various MOSs. (10) This instruction shall include the construction of an Improvised Explosive Device and shall illustrate the main device types (time, command and victim operated).

(11) Will contractor personnel, with appropriate security clearances, have access to the SIPR net to facilitate instruction, course development, and construction of IEDs based on the current threat?   A.  There is SIPRNET available at APG (203rd MI Bn).  Access is workable to a limited number of instructors.  AIs will have access to SIPRNET.  (12) Are long-term government lodging facilities available on APG, or are contractor personnel required to reside off-post?   A.  Off post at contractor's expense. (13) The solicitation states that a total of eight classes are  to be delivered during the base period (year one) and that up to four classes may be run concurrently. However, the sequencing of these classes will have a significant bearing on the flow of resources required for this work and, therefore, the cost of thi s contract. For the purposes of ensuring that all bidders cost proposals reflect comparable assumptions regarding the sequencing of classes, is there any further guidance you can provide concerning the likely timing of these classes?   A. Currently, the training classes are staggered, i.e.  Group1 - 25 Sep - 17 Oct, Group 2 - 3-24 Oct, Group 3 - 9-31 Oct, Group 417 Oct - 7 Nov. (14) For costing purposes can you please provide any additional information or assumptions that bidders can use regarding probable training sites in addition to Aberdeen Proving Grounds?  A.  Possible future training locations are not limited to but may include Fort Huachuca, Iraq, Afghanistan. (15) Are Email responses to this solicitation acceptable or are hard-copies required?    A.  E-mail responses are acceptable, as stated in the solicitation.    (16)  We assume that because the training will be taking place at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds that the State of Maryland Workers Compensation Insurance rates apply. Can you please confirm this? A.   The NGIC can't confirm or deny this assumption as we are located in Virginia. Possibly the Garrison Headquarters at APG can be a source for the confirmation. (17) This relates to support to explosives related lessons.  Will the support to the explosive demonstration, post blast scene investigation and the last day of exercise SAND BOX still be provided by the Army Test Centre (ATC) at APG.  At the moment this i s contracted directly by NGIC. We would like to ascertain that this will still be the case or if HMS would need to cost this element of the course into its proposal?   A.  ATC will provide range support at APG paid by NGIC directly to ATC.  No change from past rotations at APG. (18) Team Equipment.  There is a stock of training equipment held at APG by 203 MI Bn for WIT training.  Is this still the case or do we have to include a new ranger of team equipment in our bid? A. WIT TECHINT Kits will be provided by another contractor and available at APG for training.  The Fingerprint Kits will be provided by NGIC as well as expendables for fingerprint/evidence collection training.  (19) HMS understands there are a number of inert munitions and training aid held at APG used on previous WIT courses would this equipment be made available for this round of WIT . A.  Yes.  (20) Train the Trainer.  Do you see HMS commencing this during the first few courses or is it going to be phased in during the later courses? When would you like HMS to start using potential military trainers on the courses.  A.  Yes. A gradual transition.  Contractor will provide a complete instructor POI. (21) Admin Support.  Will the same level of support be forthcoming from 203 MI Bn during each course?  HMS has previously had an 'Operations Officer' and several staff acting as terrorists provided by 203 MI to help facilitate the exercise phase.  This i s a labour intensive phase of each course HMS would like know if this is going to be the case for courses run under this RFP.   A.  Yes. 8-12 soldiers. (22) During instruction of IT equipment DoD usually send in an external instructor with CIDNE experience to instruct this database, will this still be the case, or will HMS be required to carry out this element of the training? A.  Report writing will be provided by NGIC/AIs as well as the ATTAC Post-blast software. (23) You have asked for the Pricing proposal to be by CLIN. Is a CLIN classed as a single course delivery? If this is the case we should be submitting 8 courses a year x 4 years (base + 3 year options). Are we are being asked to provide 32 x CLIN prices?   A.  Cost per course X's 8 courses per year. (24) How would you like the proposal presented/sent to you? Email (PDF or word format) or hard copy sent via courier or both?  A.  E-mail word attachment is preferred. (25) As described on the phone, could you please expand on the technical proposal requirements for this effort?  Specifically, page count, past performance requirements, and any other pertinent details that will help to organize this proposal? A.  Page Count is not limited.  Past performance requirements - primarily experience in training WITs preparing to deploy to Iraq. (26) As per the combined solicitation referenced above, the Security Requirements on page #3 of the solicitation states that tasks performed under this contract do not require security clearances and All work will be performed at the unclassified level .  However, under several of the subparagraphs in the solicitation, reference is made to information that is at the very minimum sensitive and/or For Official Use Only (FOUO) with quite a bit of this information (if current and up to date) potentially bein g classified at the SECRET level.  Specifically, subparagraphs B, C, D, E, F, and G all contain potentially classified information on the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by terrorists and their cells in the current Global War on Terrorism environm ent for deployment of these methods.   Can you please explain how it is anticipated that a contractor would be able to provide unclassified instruction while using up to date and current information on methodology, tactics/techniques/procedures (TTP) during the execution of the course material for training on these topics? A. All WIT training instruction will be delivered at the Unclassified level with the exception of the Report Writing instruction that will be provided by NGIC/AI instructors. (27) Does the above referenced opportunity request instructors for a course of training already in existence?  Or is it asking for course development as well as instructor support?   A.  Training Course is already in existence...needs to be duplicated. (28) Based upon the periods described in the announcement, the course of instruction appears to consist of at least 3 weeks.  Is this a correct assumption? A.  18 days including Saturdays (29) Some of the required practicals will require the use of explosives.  Will the vendor be expected to have licensed explosive handlers or will the military supply EOD personnel for this purpose? A.  At APG, MD, Aberdeen Test Center will provide the Explosives, the explosive handlers, the ranges and the vehicles to be destroyed. (30) Will the vendor be expected to provide/construct all training aides (i.e. camera equipment, IED devices, etc.)?  A.

(31) Please confirm that the RFQ is a full and open solicitation. A.  Yes, this requirement is considered full and open competition. (32) The SOW states that the contractor will develop all the course   work. Our understanding is that these courses have been taking place   for some time. Will the contractor instead be updating the course   work? A.  Training Course is already in existence...needs to be duplicated/updated. (33) NGIC requires the vendor to provide eight classes per year of eighteen training days per class, does NGIC intend on conducting training forty hours per week (M-F) or forty eight hours per week (M-S)? A. 48 hours per six day week...Monday through Saturday starting and ending on various days during the week. (34)  Items pertaining to Terrorist use of Electronics (1-3), does NGIC want a Lab portion (Students performing hands on electronics construction) included for this block of instruction. A.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the description of requirements to spell out special characters for clarification purposes.  This amendment also provides answers to questions received in response to the combined synopsis solicitation. The following description of requirements is revised as follows: (vi)  Description of requirements:  The laser shall provide 8000 W or greater output at the 10.59 micron line. The laser shall be capable of operating in a true continuous wave mode. The laser shall be capable of operating in pulsed mode with a pulse width  less than or equal to 75 microseconds. The output power shall be adjustable from 0 to 8000 W. The output of the laser shall be vertically polarized. The profile of the laser in the near-field and the far-field shall be Gaussian or multimode which provides  a quasi-flat topped beam intensity profile.  A 01 mode with low intensity in the center of the beam is not acceptable. The output beam diameter shall be less than or equal to 30 mm measured at the 1/e2 points. The full angle beam divergence shall be les s than or equal to 5 mrad measured at the 1/e2 points. The laser warm-up time shall be 20 minutes or less. After the initial warm-up period, the laser power shall drift less than or equal to 5% (maximum to minimum). The pointing stability of the laser shal l be less than or equal to 250 microradians. A visible alignment laser shall be included that is aligned to the carbon dioxide laser beam. Included with the laser shall be all necessary power supplies, chillers, vacuum pumps, optics, cabling as well as all  other auxiliary equipment needed to operate the system.  The length of cable between the laser and the controller shall be 50 ft. The volume of the laser head shall be less than or equal to 350,000 cu inches with a footprint of less than or equal to 40 sq . feet. Height of laser aperture measured from base of laser head unit shall be no less than 40 inches. The laser shall operate at standard US voltages based on single or 3 phase multiples of 115V (i.e. 208, 240, 460 V), 60 Hz. The laser shall be setup and  the operation verified by company technicians at the Government work site before acceptance by the Government.  All pertinent user manuals shall be provided. A warranty shall be provided. The following questions and answers are provided: Question 1:  What will the laser be used for? (i.e. Cutting) If it is to be used for cutting, what materials will be cut? Answer 1:  It will not be used for cutting but rather for damage testing of optical devices. Question 2: Is the system required to be a Class I, fully enclosed laser, or Class IV, open laser, architecture?  Answer 2: The laser enclosure should provide Class IV access to the laser only at the exit port. Bottom line is this laser is being used for scientific testing and not assembly line manufacture ring so it is not necessary that Class 1 laser status be compl etely maintained, however, we do require an enclosure that provides some level of safety while we are setting up the laser for measurements.

<DESC>1.  The first and most important is the RH range within +68F to +180F.     There are two design models of walk-in chambers.  The first being panelized which can with 	stand your temperature range but have RH limitations.   	Panelized walk-ins are foamed-in-placed urethane panels with cam lock fasteners.  The panels cannot withstand dewpoint temperatures greater than 65C.  The panels will deteriorate.  Thus, testing at 85C @ 85% would be 81C dewpoint which the panels 	could n ot withstand.  The same holds true for the bi-fold door design.     	Therefore, it is important to know more about the MIL Standard testing being performed. Can you provide us the Mil Specifications?        	The option to a panelized walk-in is a solid construction walk-in chamber (more costly).  Do you know which style walk-in is preferred? 1. RESPONSE. Our requirements remain as listed in the Salient Characteristics. Humidity range of 25 to 95%. The Relative Humidity shall be controllable from 20 to 95% +/- 3% RH for the temperature range of +68F to +180F. 2.  The next question is what type of product is being loaded.  600lbs per square foot can be a ruggidized insulated panel, or a solid construction welded and insulated concrete floor, or an insulated concrete slab.       	A insulated concrete slab eliminates the need for ramps.  If your product is big and heavy, this would style floor may be preferred. 	Can you clarify your product type being loaded? 2. RESPONSE: A. The 600 lbs per square foot can be any type of container  with virtually any type of product including solids and liquids. A ramp is not a requirement even though it would  be desired. 3. 	Will the compressor package be located outside? 3. RESPONSE: External to the main chamber but inside the same room/building. 4. 	Do you prefer water-cooled or remote air-cooled? 4. RESPONSE: Water-cooled is preferred. 5.  	Is there a time or rate spec that the chamber should be able to track as far a XX degrees per minute rate change. 5.,6.,7., 8., RESPONSE: No ramp-temperatures specified 6. 	If so, between what temperatures? 7. 	Again if so, would this rate be for an empty chamber? 8. 	If loaded, please advise the material i.e. steel, aluminum, etc and the weight of each. 9. Size of chamber, interior volume or workspace dimensions needed? 9. RESPONSE: Nominally, the chamber work space should be 10ft X 10ft X10ft. We recognize that some space may be required for ductwork, light fixtures, etc. 10.	What will be put in the chamber? 11.	What is the Width, Depth and Height of the Device Under Test (DUT)? 12.	What is the total weight of the DUT's? 13.	How many DUT's will be tested at one time? 14.	Will there be any test fixtures used to hold the DUT? What are they made of? Their 	weight will need to be part of the total weight in the chamber. 10-14 RESPONSES: N/A as the test item(s) will vary in weight, size, type of container, quantity of containers. No test fixtures are required. 15. How many port holes will you need in the chamber? 4 or 6 inch? Where would you like them located?  15. RESPONSE: Two four-inch and two one-inch as required in the solicitation. One of each Centered on the sides is preferred. 16.	Will the item/s being tested be tested while live? If so, we need to consider the heat it will generate. Do you know how many watts or btu/hour they will be generating? 16. RESPONSE: Possibly but does not affect the requirements. 17.	Is there a temperature rate of change you would need to meet? (IE: 5 degrees F per 10 minutes.) 17. RESPONSE: See response to #5 above.
