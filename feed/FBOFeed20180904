<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br /><br />The Government requires the purchase of Fiber Fabry-Perot Tunable Filter (FFP-TF)'s. The items essential for this requirement are as follows:<br /><br />Quantity of: Two (2) <br />Fiber Fabry-Perot Tunable Filter (FFP-TF) <br />PN: FFP-TF-1500-1600-.125G1000-6-065-000
<p>Quantity of: Two (2) <br />Fiber Fabry-Perot Tunable Filter (FFP-TF)<br />PN: FFP-TF-1500-1600-.0125G1000-6-065-000</p>
<p>Quantity of: One (1) <br />Fiber Fabry-Perot Tunable Filter (FFP-TF)<br />PN: FFP-TF-1520-1570-015G650-3.5-065</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>Micron Optics, Inc.<br />1852 Century Place NE<br />Atlanta, GA 30345<br />Phone (404) 325-0005<br />Fax (404) 325-4082<br />sales@micronoptics.com<br />www.micronoptics.com</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to have a system that offers an optical high performance and low loss tunable filters for fiber based experiments. It is essential for the tunable fiber passed fabry-perot filters to have a very low loss and high finesse in a rugged and temperature insensitive package. The filter response must be as close as possible to the ideal Airy function response. The filters must be hands free and fast tuning for automation of multiple experimenters. The filters must not produces extraneous modes or be susceptible to alignment loss. As such, each device is different and requires subtly different filtering, and scans over the output. This requires a tunable filter system. Micron Optics patented all fiber design eliminates optical misalignments and extraneous modes due to collimating optics. Combined with rugged packaging it produces the most environmentally stable low loss high fidelity tunable fiber filters with near ideal Airy function response on the market. Other manufactures are unable to meet this requirement due to the patent/proprietary deign that is essential to meet the crucial specifications, without severely impacting or jeopardizing the success of ongoing research, which would result in a loss of efficiency and the ability to experiment will be impaired.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quote, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 September 2018.</p>

<DESC>The NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO)&nbsp;intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the provision of a backup, archive, and recovery solution for the STO Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE).
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), (3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-CMRE-18-008 and all correspondence concerning the IFIB should reference this number.</p>
<p>The type of contract is Firm Fixed Price (FFP). Partial bidding is not envisioned. The contract will be awarded to the&nbsp;Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) bid.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>CMRE requires an enterprise-grade data backup, archive, and recovery solution for its unclassified data center in La Spezia, Italy and for the smaller-scale data center installed onboard the NATO Research Vessel (NRV) Alliance. Both data centers use virtualization based on Vmware to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The systems for data backup, archive, and recovery shall be supplied as a turnkey solution, inclusive of professional services for system installation, configuration, training, testing, and transition to operations.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 03 October 2018<br /><br />CMRE distributes IFIB to firms on its bidders list (target): TBD</p>
<p>Bid closing (target): 12 November 2018</p>

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA263-18-AP-5011  

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 23,  NCO 23, Supply Branch, Coralville, Iowa
Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501).  Single Award BPA for Fecal Immunichemical Tests
Order against:     FSS Contract Number: V797D-70097
Name of Proposed Contractor:
Polymedco
Street Address:
510 Furnace Dock Road
City, State, Zip:
Cortlandt Manor, NY 10567
Phone:
800-431-2123








Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 592,890.00
The VISN 23 Laboratories must use FDA approved testing for diagnosis and treatment basis of patients.  The requirement is for a Base +4 Option years BPA for Fecal Immunochemical Tests and supplies.
Minneapolis, St. Cloud, Iowa City, and Sioux Falls already have separate contracts with Polymedco for FIT. A VISN contract would consolidate multiple awards and standardize testing and equipment within VISN 23.   


(4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; This vendor is the only FDA approved Fecal Immunochemical Test provider.

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.) 

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  The items are on schedule and are considered fair and reasonable, a single award BPA will consolidate the VISN under a single award BPA.  This will streamline ordering procedures and save the VA time and money ordering required supplies.


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: A Search on the NAC and GSA Advantage showed a single schedule holder for the required items.  A VIP searched returned no Vendors for the Fecal Immunochemical Test.   



(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION: This vendor is the only FDA approved vendor for the items.


(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE: The agency will continue to monitor the marketplace and open opportunities up to vendors as they are capable of providing the required materials.


(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) at the NIH has a requirement to obtain one (1) High-Volume (HV) Liquid handling robot from TTP Labtech, the 5-position deck mosquito&reg; HV Genomics, P/N: 3097-01057, and accessories, which will allow Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) scientists to optimize miniaturization and automation of next generation sequencing library construction. Transcriptomics analysis at single cell level is essential for SCTL scientists. Accessories include the following items with quanitity, part number, and description:<br />1 3097-01057 5-position deck mosquito&reg; HV Genomics<br />1 SLA-TRA-018 mosquito&reg; - Operator training for upto 4 people on installation (0.5 day)<br />1 SLA-TRA-019 mosquito&reg; - Additional Operator training for 2 people on installation (0.5 day)<br />1 SD WIZARD Includes Serial Dilution Software Wizard<br />1 3019-06101 mosquito&reg; Application Software<br />1 3019-0030 mosquito&reg; Configured Lap Top Computer<br />1 4150-03032 Spool of 13500 Gamma Ray Sterilised Pipettes 9mm Pitch HV<br />1 3019-03020 1 pipette loader<br />5 4150-02205 mosquito&reg; leader tape<br />1 3019-05104 Calibration Block<br />2 3085-01035 Plate Clamp Magnetic<br />1 3019-04134 Pipette tape spool cover<br />1 SZZ00136 Magnetic Bead Separation Block for 384 PCR Plates<br />1 SLA-MOS-005 mosquito&reg; TTPremium 12-month Service Contract</p>
<p>The subject supply is to be used for miniaturizing a wide range of applications that require accurate low volume pipetting without the risk of cross-contamination. NCATS has existing liquid handling programs for sequencing library generation which need to be compatible with the current scRNAseq and scATAC-seq sequencing library platforms used in the SCTL lab.</p>
<p>An existing instrument at NCATS for which this requirement needs to be compatible is the Fluidigm C1 system, manufactured by Fluidigm, and is used for single cell genomics research in SCTL lab. In order to understand genomic heterogeneity at single cell level during differentiation, we perform full length transcriptome profiling at single cell level (scRNA-seq) using C1 mRNA seq HT IFC chip and chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-sseq)) using C1 Open App IFC chip on Fluidigm C1 system. Fluidigm C1 system using microfluidic technology allows single cell isolation automatically and subsequent cell lysis, cDNA synthesis and amplification in Fluidigm C1 system.</p>
<p>The amplified cDNA (96 samples for each run) will be carried forward for subsequent library construction in order to read on the existing Illumina sequencer in the SCTL lab, the NextSeq500, manufactured by Illumina. The High-Volume Liquid Handling Robot will provide for this automatic and miniature solution for sequencing library construction. It miniaturizes the library construction process (2-4 fold) to save reagent cost by diluting/normalizing cDNA library from the Fluidigm system thereby performing necessary tagmentation, barcoding, and purification steps for sequencing library construction.</p>
<p>The final products are then sequenced on the Illumina sequencer to provide transcriptome profile (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility profile (scATAC-seq). The applications mentioned above needs to be supported by a software program to support this specific multi-step automation on the High-Volume Liquid Handling Robot.</p>
<p>Delivery/Warranty<br />Offerors should ind icate an estimated delivery time in full after receipt of an order and any other training or warranty or software licenses applicable. Inspection and acceptance will be performed at NCATS located at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20852. A Firm-Fixed price type of contract is anticipated to be awarded as a result of this solicitation.</p>

EFW is a supplier of Elbit Systems of America (ESA). The CHMD components to be procured are: FACT/Fast Characterization Tool, Elbit Systems of America (ESA) Part Number (P/N) MB559V-00 (quantity 15); Ready Room Tester, Elbit Systems P/N TB1707A-00 (quantity 15); Helmet Modification Fixture, Elbit Systems P/N 073219A-00 (quantity 15); and the Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Mod Kit, Elbit Systems P/N TB1690C-00 (quantity 20). This requirement also includes a technical data package for each of the CHMD components and upgrade to Windows 10 for a quantity of five (5) P/N MB559V-00, FACT/Fast Characterization Tools.<br />Issuance of a firm-fixed priced delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-17-G-0014 awarded to EFW Inc. is anticipated. ESA is the original equipment manufacturer of the Color Helmet Mounted Display on the CV-22 Aircraft and the components have been integrated and flight qualified on the CV-22. The Government has limited technical data rights to the components. Consequently, ESA is the only source with the requisite knowledge and technical data for these components to satisfy CV-22 requirements. Anticipated delivery will be f.o.b. destination fourteen (14) months after contract award to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ. <br />The Government intends to procure this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a response which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. 

FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs, such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.
This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center, through the Living Marine Resources (LMR) program, is soliciting pre-proposals for efforts related to the need topic listed below. If invited, offerors will be asked to submit a full proposal.

NEED TOPIC N-0203-19:  IMPROVEMENT OF MEDIUM-TERM TELEMETRY TAG ATTACHMENT DURATION

Marine mammal baseline behavioral data (diving, movement) and behavioral and physiological response to sonar exposure data derived from animal telemetry provide the foundation for behavioral response criteria in the Navys acoustic effects modeling, among other uses.


Over the past two decades, biologists have been especially successful in attaching tracking devices to cetaceans at the small and large end of their size range. A solution for tagging all sizes (small, medium, and large-sized) cetaceans using 4-6 cm darts is the Low Impact Minimally Percutaneous External-electronics Transmitter (LIMPET) tag system, which is a readily available commercial product being deployed on a wide range of cetacean species (~ 28) across the globe. The current time-scale for LIMPET and other tag packages (some under development) using darts ranges from a few days to a few weeks, with the occasional tag lasting several months. Its possible that the rigid materials and connection between the tag body and dart attachments are limiting tag durations.
Improvements in dart design are needed to increase tag deployment durations to one to several months on average. 

LMR is seeking pre-proposals focused on research towards the re-design and/or improvement of medium-term tag attachment methods for dart-style tag attachments for marine mammals. This might include designs that limit the transfer of forces between the tag body and dart attachments, changes in materials and design used in dart attachments, and tag and attachment designs that are more tolerant of wider angles of approach when deploying tags.
 
NEED TOPIC N-0204-19: DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION OF PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING (PAM) BASED DENSITY ESTIMATION METHODS USING VISUALLY VERIFIED SURVEY DATA

Marine mammal density estimates are a critical input for the Navys acoustic effects modelling.
Traditional ship and aerial visual survey estimates of marine mammal density are viable for the Navy, but very limited in their spatial and temporal coverage and many species are difficult to sight. The use of fixed-PAM for density estimation has the potential to increase the amount of density data in all US-waters and Navy ranges that can be used in the Navys acoustic effects modeling. However, these relatively new statistical approaches still need to be demonstrated and validated. 

LMR is seeking pre-proposals demonstrating and validating fixed-PAM based density estimation methods using vessel or shore-based visual surveys on species that have a high confidence level in being sighted. The objectives of the study should include:

1)	Collection of concurrent visual sightings groups from cliff-based or boat-based observation sites, and localization of vocally active individuals or groups of animals using an array of time-synchronized fixed-PAM data recorders.
2)	Obtain visually-estimated group sizes, group counts, and acoustic detection ranges by focal-group tracking.
3)	Comparison of density estimates obtained using multiple fixed-PAM density estimation methods (cue-counting, point-transect sampling methods, Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture - SECR);
4)	Validation of PAM density estimation approaches against visual survey density estimates, and evaluate which PAM density method work best for which species and circumstance.


NEED TOPIC N-0205-19 INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF CUE RATE AND CUE STABILITY ON PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING (PAM) BASED DENSITY ESTIMATION METHODS

Marine mammal density estimates are a critical input for the Navys acoustic effects modelling. Traditional ship and aerial visual survey estimates of marine mammal density are viable for the Navy, but very limited in their spatial and temporal coverage and many species are difficult to sight. The use of fixed-PAM for density estimation has the potential to increase the amount of density data in all US-waters and Navy ranges that can be used in the Navys acoustic effects modeling. However, these relatively new statistical approaches still need to be demonstrated and validated.


In some PAM based density estimation methods, the cue rate or the marine mammal sound production rate is an important multiplier to get to a final density estimate. Cue rates can vary in marine mammals as a function of time of day, year, group size, season, bottom depth, location, etc. Also often cue rates are determined from limited data sets and assumed to be representative for the species.

LMR is seeking pre-proposals that investigate cue rate and cue stability for use in PAM-based density estimation methods. Priority will be given to pre-proposals that focus on species groups listed in Appendix A. This can include a model-based approach using existing data. The ultimate result of this research should inform us on the most appropriate cue rates for species/context that can be characterized and make recommendations of most appropriate species to further collect cue rate data for.
 

NEED TOPIC N-0206-19:  DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION OF PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING SPARSE ARRAYS TO ESTIMATE THE DENSITY OF LOW-FREQUENCY WHALES OVER LARGE SPATIAL AREAS

Marine mammal density estimates are a critical input for the Navys acoustic effects modelling using NAEMO. Traditional ship and aerial visual survey estimates of marine mammal density are viable for the Navy, but very limited in their spatial and temporal coverage. 

The ONR Marine Mammals  and  Biology program has developed Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) approaches using sparse arrays where sensors are distributed evenly over a large area of interest, and are often referred to as platforms of opportunity because their primary monitoring purpose is not for marine mammals.
Sparse arrays, including Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System (CTBTO IMS) data, have been used to detect and track blue and fin whales.  Traditional and novel density estimation methods have been applied to data from OBSs and then adapted for CTBTO IMS data There are a variety of density estimation approaches that have been successfully used on OBS data to estimate density of fin and blue whales; whereas, for CTBTO IMS data it has worked well on stereotyped vocalizations like fin whale 20-Hz calls, but additional development is required for the more variable blue whales calls. While these studies have demonstrated the utility of OBS and CTBTO IMS data, the techniques to 1) estimate range to calling animals, and 2) density estimation methods still need to be compared and validated under different conditions to be able to fully utilize the worldwide dataset.


LMR is seeking pre-proposals that will identify a suite of case studies of OBS data for blue and fin whales and CTBTO IMS data for fin whales from around the world that represent the variability of environmental conditions at OBS and CTBTO IMS locations worldwide, with the goal of determining the best methods to estimate the detection range of fin and blue whales and the most appropriate application of acoustic based density estimation methods. Deliverables should include a set of tools, training materials, and documentation that will help stakeholders to use OBS and CTBTO IMS data in a given geographic area to produce density estimates for blue and/or fin whales.

NEED TOPIC N-0207-19:  IDENTIFICATION OF MONITORING PRIORITIES FOR STUDYING THE POPULATION CONSEQUENCES OF DISTURBANCE ON MARINE MAMMALS

The population consequences of disturbance (PCoD) framework provide a conceptual framework which can be used to forecast a plausible range of outcomes for the possible effects of Navy activities on marine mammals.
However, significant data gaps exist and it may take decades to fill these gaps. Therefore, there is significant interest in identifying current methods for monitoring populations subject to disturbance that may also provide insights into the processes through which disturbance may affect these populations. Recent reports have indicated that monitoring for health variables, capture-recapture, individual tracking (e.g. telemetry), remote tissue sampling and (vertical) photogrammetry were considered the most useful methods for PCOD analysis involving baleen whale and deep-diving cetacean species.

The overall approach of the Navy Marine Species Monitoring (MSM) Program for both Atlantic and Pacific range complexes is captured in four conceptual framework categories (DoN 2016a, b): Occurrence, Exposure, Response, and Consequences studies.
These categories parallel the PCoD framework described in New et al. (2014), where Occurrence and Exposure are integral to the assessment of numbers of animals disturbed, Response captures the link between disturbance and behavioral and physiological changes, and Consequences is concerned with how such changes might impact upon health, vital rates and ultimately population dynamics.

The LMR program is seeking pre-proposals that evaluate the Navy MSM program in terms of how to specifically inform future PCoD analyses. Given the effort currently being conducted and that has been conducted over the past 10 years of the Navy MSM program, proposals should assess existing data collected to date to determine what might be achieved retrospectively in a PCoD analysis.
A review of exiting data might include a review of effort conducted to date, sample sizes obtained for different species/variables and species/method-specific power analyses to determine the levels of effort required to collect sample sizes to inform future PCoD analyses.

The results of the study should inform the Navy MSM program of the methods and approaches the program could take to enable the future ability to conduct PCoD analysis. The recommendation of integrating future additional monitoring data collection or analyses should be done in the context of the existing Navy MSM programs. For example, photo-ID, biopsy, vertical photogrammetry, and individual tracking methods could be suggested as secondary efforts to already funded visual surveys.

NEED TOPIC N-0208-19: TURTLE TTS FEASIBILITY STUDY

The Navy, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and other federal agencies require quantitative thresholds to examine the potential impacts of underwater sound on protected species.
General audiometric information is available for most sea turtle species, however, data on the susceptibility of sea turtles to noise induced hearing threshold shifts is lacking.  

LMR is partnering with NMFS Office of Protected Resources and the Office of Science and Technology to conduct a feasibility study on obtaining temporary threshold shift (TTS) information for sea turtles. Due to animal care concerns associated with inducing TTS in Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed sea turtles, this project should be undertaken in a two stage process. First, to determine the feasibility of generating TTS in a closely related surrogate - a non-ESA listed turtle species (e.g. diamondback terrapin, red-eared slider, pond slider, etc.).
If this step is successful, the second stage would be to obtain TTS information for an ESA listed sea turtle, preferably a loggerhead or green sea turtle. Proposals should encapsulate the methods and costs associated with both stages of the studys feasibility. All associated animal handling permits and agreements (i.e. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), etc.) should be in place prior to award. If the offeror currently possesses a permit or other documentation, it should be mentioned in the preproposal and submitted as part of the full proposal. In addition, all costs, logistics and schedule requirements associated with obtaining NMFS and US Fish and Wildlife permits for the second stage should be outlined prior to full commitment of the first stage of the study.
 
   
SUPPORTING INFORMATION: 
For more information on what is required in a proposal, guidance on LMR priority species and geographic regions, how to submit a proposal via the LMR website, and how proposals are evaluated, refer to Appendix A. Offerors will be required to adhere to the data rights and handling procedures agreement (Appendix B) and the geospatial data requirements (Appendix C). Modifications to the data rights and handling procedures agreement or geospatial data requirements should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to proposal submission. Offerors will also need to comply with the LMR Ocean Observing Systems (OOS) Notification Procedures (Appendix D).  Offerors should note, however, that locations labelled in red in Appendix D as incompatible with acoustic OOS actually overlap with some of the LMR priority geographic regions outlined in Appendix A.
Strict adherence to passive acoustic monitoring site selection, passive acoustic device deployment notification and data custody guidance will be required. Site selection should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to submission of the proposal package. DoD is still finalizing their plan to meet the goals and requirements of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research issued 2013 February 22. All projects funded by LMR would be subject to DoD policy once it is finalized. 

Proposed efforts involving interaction with and contact with marine mammals or endangered species may require research permits including but not limited to a Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Research Permit, Endangered Species Act (ESA) scientific research permit, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and/or Department of Defense Animal Care and Use authorization.
It is the expectation that all offerors will complete any necessary regulatory compliance permitting/consultations, necessary to conduct the research. If the offeror currently possesses a permit or other documentation, it should be mentioned in the preproposal and submitted as part of the full proposal. If your project involves developing or demonstrating a technology, an agreement with NAVFAC EXWC will need to be established to describe the ownership/use of the technology. Contracts will not be awarded without appropriate regulatory documentation and all agreements in place.

SUBMISSION PROCESS: 
The pre-proposal submittal process is an email-based submission.  Pre-proposals should be submitted via email to exwc_lmr_program@navy.mil.
There is no specific format required for the pre-proposal, however, the pre-proposal should be consolidated into one single file and should not exceed 10 pages in length. All pre-proposal submissions must be received before the deadline.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 
To be considered for funding in FY 2019, pre-proposals must be received no later than 11:59 pm, Pacific Daylight Time on 22 October 2018. Offerors will receive a confirmation email message acknowledging successful submission. It is the responsibility of the offeror to confirm receipt of the submission. If invited to submit a full proposal, these will be due 30 days after notification. 

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
Following a 2-month evaluation and selection process, successful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email inviting submission of a full proposal.
Unsuccessful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email, but will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for preproposal rejection, due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Awards to non-government entities (academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, industry) will be in the form of contracts. A nominal award amount has not been provided because the scope of the need topics varies considerably. However, proposals less than $300K/year are more likely to be funded given the available budget of the LMR program in FY 2019-2020. Proposals costing over $300K per year will still be considered, but we would expect a strong justification for the increased cost . The nominal duration of a project is expected to be 1-3 years, with a maximum of 5 years.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to use realism of cost for the proposed effort as their metric, as this will be a critical element in the review process. Otherwise, meritorious pre-proposals and full proposals will be rejected if cost does not accurately reflect the proposed scope of work. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, of approximately equal weight. 

1.	TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives in terms of meeting the stated need topic, as well as evidence that the science/technology is mature enough for applied research funding, and the performance criteria to measure success of the research effort.

2.	An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM).
No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Registration is not required for proposal submission, but must be completed prior to initiation of award negotiation. To avoid delays in the award process, applicants are encouraged to initiate SAM registration early in the submission and review process. Non-government awardees will also need to provide a DUNS (Dunn  and  Bradstreet) number (http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.doc) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code (http://govwin.com/knowledge/ccr-registration) before an award can be made. 

3.	The preceding data should be sufficient for completing a pre-proposal.
 
4.	There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA.
Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA must follow the instructions to submit a pre-proposal. 

5.	There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the contractor before a contract award. 

6.	As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified pre-proposals with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific projects. Technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207.
The cognizant Program Manager and other scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, pre-proposal and full proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractors employee having access to technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any pre-proposal or full proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of their institutional NDA with their proposal.
However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors who have submitted a pre-proposal, after the Review Committee reviewed all pre-proposals submitted by the solicitation cut-off date.

This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE:   Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:

Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or

VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.

Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and  (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The Information Security Officer (ISO) needs to maintain the documentation.


SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:  Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

TRAINING:  All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

Region 5, U.S. EPA Superfund Division, Emergency Response Branch requires one (1) Portable Mercury Vapor Analyzer (MVA) for real-time measurements (one second intervals) of low-level mercury concentrations (less than 10 ng/m3 lower detection limit) for emergency responses to monitor indoor and outdoor areas extent of contamination surveys, assess contamination items, and clearing structures for re-occupancy.
The MVA should be comparable to NIOSH 6009 methods for use in clearing structures for re-occupancy (refer to link to ASTDR paper below) and EPA methods 245 and 7473 for analysis of mercury in water, solids and solutions.  The MVA is for indoor and outdoor use, thus it must be rugged, portable, lightweight, include field performance verification and able to perform in the field for 10+ hours.  The instrument should come with all hardware and software necessary for normal operation use, such as case/bag, power supplies/chargers, USB cable for downloading data logging,  zero mercury/dust filters and house assembly (hose, nozzle, PTFE).
The instrument should be NIST traceable and come with calibration certificate, user manuals, and quick start guides.  
The offered scientific instrument is replacing the Ohio Lumex RA 915+ which needs repairs, such as replacement blower assembly and motherboard.  EPA is seeking to use the exchange authority of 40 U.S.C 503 and apply any exchange allowance from the RA 915+ in part for payment of the property being acquired. Being the item is replacing the Ohio Lumex RA 915+, the recommended brand name item is the Ohio Lumex Portable Zeeman Mercury Analyzer RA-915M. The government may consider quotes on a brand name or equal basis.  If quoting another devices besides the recommended make/model, it should be 1) either compatible with EPA owned water and soil analysis attachments, specifically the Lumex RP-92 for analysis of mercury in water and the Lumex PYRO-916 for analysis of mercury in solids, or be quoted with comparable attachments, and 2) include necessary data logger in quote. 
Environmentally Preferred Equipment should not use hazardous chemical for operation.

To be considered technically acceptable, the products must meet the following minimum salient characteristics:
Must meet minimum salient characteristics to be technically acceptable:


 
SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS: 
 
Bedframe Requirements:
Bed Configuration Awareness System:
The bedframe must have an awareness system that allows the caregiver to establish specific safety parameters for each individual patient. The system needs to be customizable to each patient, not a  one size fits all system . The system should monitor  Never Events  like falls and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia. The bed needs to monitor bed fall risk compliance measures including bed low height, brake engagement, side rail configuration and bed exit armed/disarmed. The bed must also monitor the 30-degree head of bed lockout, which is a Ventilator Associated Pneumonia compliance strategy. 
We also need a local visual display that the bed is in the proper configuration and another visual display when the bed is in the incorrect configuration. This should be easily viewed from outside the patient s room and easily recognizable to all staff members.
The system also needs to have the ability to send alerts through the nurse call system and/or wirelessly to the nurse s station and other locations to notify staff that a change has occurred. 
Single Touch 30-Degree Head of Bed Button
The bedframe must have a single touch 30-Degree Head of Bed lockout. This is necessary to lock patients head of bed at or above 30-degrees when they are vented or on a tube. Not complying with this can put the patient at risk for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.
Retractable Frame
The bedframe needs to retract towards the wall when the head of bed is raised. This is necessary to keep our patients closer to their belongings and to help lower sheer on patient s skin as their head is raised. This is also needed to lower the amount of boosting nursing staff has to do.
Side Rails
The side rails of the bed frame need to follow a clocking motion when they are raised and lowered. This is necessary because of the small space in the room for the bedframe. They also need to have three positions, up, down and intermediate for patient ingress and egress. The head end rails and the foot end rails need to have grip points for patient hand placement during ingress and egress. The side rails also need to have the ability to tuck in to the frame for transport through narrow doorways or passages. The side rails also must also have one hand articulation capabilities.
Foot End Outlets
The frame must have two 110-volt foot end outlets to plug pumps and other pieces of equipment in to. This is necessary to reduce lines and trip hazards in the room for both the patient and the caregiver.  
Integrated Pump Hanging Bar
The foot end portion of the bed must have an integrated pump holder to attach SCD s and other equipment. This is needed to keep equipment off the floor to help reduce infection control issues and trip hazards.
Single Touch Buttons
The bed must be able to articulate and be locked/unlocked with single touch buttons. The caregivers need the ability to change the bed position and lock/unlock motion controls with a single button and with one hand. 
Centrally Located Brake Pedal
The frame must have one large, centrally located brake pedal on each side of the bed. This is necessary as a visual indicator that the brake is locked and so that it is not covered by sheets or linens. 
Foot End Controls
The frame must have foot end caregiver controls. The foot end controls are necessary for protocols and lockouts to be engaged/disengaged away from the patients reach. If the bed exit on/off is located in the side rail the patient can disengage the alarm without setting it off. By placing the controls in a covered section of the footboard, you can help remove this risk.
Three Sided Controls
Caregivers need to be able to access the bed motion controls from either side and the foot end. This is necessary to be able to articulate the frame regardless of where the caregiver is positioned in the room.
Single Touch, Weigh In Any Position Scale
The scale system must have the ability to weigh the patient in any position and any bed articulation. It must also be activated with a single touch button. The scale must also measure and store up to 10 weights in the bed. 
Bed Exit System
The bedframe must have a three zone bed exit system that is based off of the patient s weight and center of gravity. This system is necessary to arm the patient in the correct bed exit setting and to reduce the false alarms and alarm fatigue for the staff.
Wireless Connectivity
The bedframe must have the ability to be wirelessly integrated into our nurse call and EMR systems. This is necessary to be able to track patient data and staff compliance with risk management
Patient Helper Capable
The frame must be able to accommodate a patient helper for staff and patient use.
Adjustable Headboard Height: 
When the bed height is adjusted, the headboard height must adjust up and down as well. This allows the bed to accommodate a safe / ergonomic height for patient transport (safe patient handling initiative). This also allows bed to accommodate 4-post traction setup without additional adapters / equipment. 
Integrated Traction Sleeves
The bedframe must have built in traction sleeves for four post and bucks traction capability. These traction sleeves must also stay stationary when the head of bed is adjusted. This will protect the four post traction from bending and potential damage and patient/staff injury.
Extension Capable
The frame must be capable of extending the patient surface area from 84  long to 94  long. 
Single Touch Cardiac Chair
The bedframe must have a single touch button to articulate the bed in to a full chair position.
Downward Motion Interrupt
The bedframe must have a downward motion interrupt to stop the bed from lowering if any equipment is blocking the frame.
CPR Functions
The bedframe must have manual head end CPR release triggers and an electronic CPR function. The head board must also detach from the frame for CPR access.
Foley Hooks
The frame must have four different Foley hook locations so that the caregivers can place Foley bags and other pieces of equipment on the bed. This is necessary to reduce trip hazards and clutter in the room.
Open Frame Architecture
The frame must have the ability to accommodate any standard sized patient care mattress. This is necessary to provide different therapy surfaces for different patient needs.

<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to issue firm-fixed price contracts on a sole source basis under the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1) (B) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This procurement is restricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The U.S. Coast Guard intends to negotiate and award a Firm Fixed Price Contract on a sole source basis to each offeror who was a holder of one of the five Industry Studies contracts (previously awarded on a full and open competition basis) and who submits a technical and price proposal to the Heavy Polar Icebreaker Detail Design &amp; Construction solicitation, N00024-18-R-2210.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to conduct Polar Icebreaker Production Engineering Studies (PIPES) to analyze the production risk areas to help reduce those risks regarding technical, schedule and cost impacts of critical production requirements and to help ensure the Government has a clear understanding of Contractor production capabilities post-award of the Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) Contract. Only those offerors who completed Industry Studies contracts and submit a proposal in response to the HPIB DD&amp;C contract can complete this effort in the timeframe required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Initiating a new competitive acquisition would cause a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and result in unacceptable delays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The production engineering studies allows the bidding Industry teams to continue to work on developing technical understanding in several potentially high risk production areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, quotations or expressions of interest. No solicitation package will be issued. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is within the underlying authority contained in the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>

<DESC>The VA Northern California Healthcare System (VANCHCS) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Medline Industries, Inc. The proposed urgent contract action is to acquire a 90-day supply, with an optional 90 day extension period, of surgical custom packs for use in the VANCHCS operating room, interventional radiology, cardiac catheterization lab, and for other procedures.
These packs are no longer available on the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) schedule. Award of a local contracting vehicle has been halted by protest.  To meet the dire and continual demand for custom packs required for scheduled procedures, VAMC Mather requires the ongoing service of Medline Industries, Inc. Obtaining custom packs from another vendor would result in a break in services that  would interrupt scheduled procedures and prevent patient care.
This sole source action is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no competitive solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements or provide an equal product may give written notification to the contract specialist for consideration. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform, and is due by  September 7, 2018 at 3:00PM Pacific.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to Engineering & Computer Simulations (ECS), Inc. 11825 High Tech Ave. Ste. 250, Orland, FL 32817 to procure new web content for an existing Geriatrics Late Life Depression training simulator.  The new web content shall support VA learning objectives for patient care in Geriatrics. 

In June 2013 VA Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Employee Education Services procured Software as a Service (SaaS) in the form of web content delivered on a hosted solution with an embedded educational simulation that prepares medical practitioners for key conversations with patients. This was a competitive procurement for a total IT solution inclusive of the training simulation development as well as providing commercial hosting for the simulation itself.  The hosted solution is operational and meeting VA goals for the delivery of simulated training.  VA training requirements evolve over time to ensure accurate and timely care to Veterans.  This requirement will address training gaps to increase the level of care in Geriatrics Late Life Depression.  VHA requires the incorporation of customized web content to support new training objectives for VA medical practitioners to meet the specific needs of Veterans.  VHA also requires the hosted solution in the Cloud to be re-configured to capture user data.

Only ECS can provide these services as the hosted solution is owned by ECS and contains proprietary information within the cloud hosted platform. VA  s limited data rights to the solution does not provide VA access to the proprietary source code.  Only ECS has access to the proprietary source code and configurations that are necessary to incorporate any changes or modifications to the application and computing environment. If any other offeror were to attempt to modify this code it would result in an invalidation of all licenses and agreements with ECS and VA would be evicted from the current hosting environment. 

In November 2017, VHA investigated the ability to migrate the current solution to a new environment. However, this process would require new development of Application Programming Interfaces which is estimated to take at minimum two years for full operational capability. This would result in downtime for the current educational game and would significantly reduce the return on investment for the training product.  Competing for new software and hosted solution would not result in savings, and the purchase of technical services to customize the existing solution is more advantageous to the VA.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within three (3) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government, September 07, 2018 @ 3:00pm CST. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Any quotation/response should be emailed to Aaron Waltersdorff, Contract Specialist at e-mail address aaron.waltersdorff@va.gov; phone 512-981-4469.

<DESC>The United States Army is seeking information, for planning purposes only, an available Commercial Off the Shelf/Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI), modified commercial or non-commercial systems which may support the potential future acquisition of the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS). EHETS transports heavy and oversized equipment in support of the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). EHETS is considered to be a whole system, including a prime mover, hereon referred to as a tractor and a semitrailer, alternately, the tractor and semitrailer may possibly be procured and fielded separately. For purposes of responding to this RFI, it is preferred to respond with whole systems solutions. However, if whole system solutions are not available at the time of the RFI response, at a minimum, independent tractor or semitrailer responses are acceptable. The USG will utilize this information to determine whether the EHETS characteristics (ref. Section II) can be met by industry. The responses to this RFI will help identify which EHETS characteristics are technologically challenging and which may drive the solution set into either a developmental program, or contribute most significantly to cost and/or schedule. Industry is requested to identify any EHETS characteristics which, if adjusted, would allow other potential options to compete in possible future solicitations.

<DESC>Statement of Work for Walsh QA Inspector Program 

VAMC Northport Environmental Management Service is seeking to acquire the Walsh QA Inspector program. To meet the needs of the department, EMS will need two tablets with three user licenses. The hardware, database setup, telephone training program, and hard case are also needed. The Walsh QA Inspector program, purchased with the necessary tablets and hardware, can run a number of customized checklists that improve supervisor room inspections. The QA Inspector has the ability to generate automatic follow-ups, set due dates and generate detailed reports. It also allows the adding of photos and notes in order to increase inspection efficiency. Supervisors can inspect their assigned areas and hold employees accountable. It improves accountability and performance by generating meaningful reports allowing supervisors to review any room to ascertain its last inspection date, thus providing better clarification to its current status and to what needs to be accomplished. 
The Walsh QA Inspector implements a consistent inspection process that is completely mobile, which means it s easily accessible by everyone involved. It is hoped that this software will help VAMC Northport s Environmental Management Service to become better organized, generate less paper and pinpoint issues in a way not previously possible. 

The Walsh QA Inspector Program offers: 
Two iPad Mini 4, 7.9  Screen 
Hard case and screen protection package 
Hardware setup; installation configuration, network setup, pass through warranty 
Four 1-hour telephone and web training sessions 
Database setup 
Three user license fees 
App & portal upgrades 
Unlimited online support
This solicitation requires a base year plus 4 option years for maintenance & support.

<p>The Defense Logistics Agency Aviation-Richmond is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to determine if other companies are capable of manufacturing (or legitimately obtain) the item indicated. The Government is seeking parties having an interest in and the resources to support NSN 2840-007041301. This item is currently manufactured by: Orenda, (Cage 35013), and Aviall (Cage 22819) under P/N 37D401014P101. Technical Orders and Qualification Requirements are not available. Potential sources shall be capable of furnishing all labor, materials, facilities and equipment required to accomplish the new manufacture of the item(s). Generally, this entails the procurement/manufacture of component parts, inspection, testing, preservation/packaging, and shipping. Additionally, potential sources may be responsible for supply chain management, logistics planning, forecasting production requirements, long-lead time parts procurement, diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortage issues, and shipping serviceable assets. The estimated quantity is 106 each. The unit prices will be established at the time of a contract award. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 336412. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. The sources sought notification is NOT FOR THE CURRENT BUY, the intention is to get vendors interested in getting approved so they can compete on the NEXT buy. If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract. BASED ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/MARKET RESEARCH, THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, and multiple awards MAY be made.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), General Supplies and Services (GSS) Portfolio, Office of Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Internal and Emergency Acquisition Division (IEAD) is seeking information related to how interested contractors could provide Global Supply OCONUS Logistics Operations Solutions Support within United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). Currently, GSA is the supplier of choice for both Federal civilian and military consumers of office supplies, tools and hardware, housewares, furniture, and cleaning products.  GSA presently* purchases these items in the United States for export to military units stationed or deployed to Hawaii, Guam, Korea and Japan.  In cooperation with the Department of Defense (DoD), the purpose of this potential requirement would be to support overseas customers utilizing a more expeditious solution to supply items to the customer. Ideally, in accordance with required regulations, the Contractor would be responsible for sourcing and delivering products within 3-5 business days after receipt of order. The "Ship To" location could either be military and non-military facilities in the Indo-Pacom area of operations (Attachment 1) as directed in individual purchase orders for the items in Attachment 2.  Additionally, the primary warehouse operations will be established in Hawaii, Guam, Korea, and Japan. The contractor would need to have the capability to surge to support contingency operations, natural disaster, and war.

<SUBJECT>Designated Observables (DO) Non-Government/Private Sector Participation in Studies
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDKL
<CONTACT>Sandra A. Cauffman, Earth Science Division Deputy Director, Email Sandra.A.Cauffman@nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Headquarters (HQ) is seeking information from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining how non-governmental/private sector organizations can best engage in NASA-sponsored, multicenter, observing system architecture studies related to the 2017 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space (2017 ESAS). The Government reserves the right to consider Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside(s) based on responses hereto.
<div><br />The NASA Earth Science Division (ESD) is seeking new ways to leverage the work and ideas in the non-governmental/private sector to contribute possible approaches that may address the designated observables recommendations in the 2017 ESAS in order to increase mission/observing system capability and/or to reduce costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The 2017 ESAS describes a "new" program element identified as the Designated Observables (DOs). The DOs are cost-capped, medium- and large-cost, spaceborne observing systems to acquire measurements that are specifically identified in the survey as essential to the science and applications activities of NASA's ESD; the DOs are considered foundational components of the decade's observations. The 2017 ESAS suggests that NASA design and coordinate the implementation of up to three large-cost spaceborne observing systems and two medium-cost spaceborne observing systems.</p>
<p>ESD is taking a broad approach to addressing the observation architectures for the DOs. That is, we do not consider the solution space for each DO to be limited to a single dedicated satellite mission; rather, we wish initially to examine and evaluate the costs and benefits of observing system architectures that might include a mix of NASA, international, interagency, commercial, spaceborne assets and data products.</p>
<p>The five general science/observation foci of the DOs identified in the 2017 ESAS are:<br />&bull; Aerosols<br />&bull; Clouds, Convection and Precipitation (CCP)<br />&bull; Mass Change (MC)<br />&bull; Surface Biology and Geology (SBG)<br />&bull; Surface Deformation and Change (SDC)</p>
<p>On June 1, 2018, the ESD invited NASA centers to develop and submit multi-center plans for studies of DO architectures. The NASA guidance asked the multi-center teams to design studies aimed at identifying and evaluating all aspects of DO architectures, including payload capabilities and technologies for classical satellite missions, components of possible heterogeneous observing systems, ground and data systems, operations, and calibration/validation.</p>
<p>Based on the multi-center plans received, four observing system architecture studies will be initiated in October 2018: Combined A/CCP, MC, SBG and SDC.</p>
<p>With this RFI, ESD solicits input from industry and other non-governmental organizations regarding how they wish to be involved in these multi-year NASA observing system architecture studies.</p>
<p>All interested offerors interested in participating in the multi-center studies for the DOs should submit a statement of 10 pages or less providing:<br />&bull; ideas from the non-governmental/private sector on ways to participate in the planning process associated with realistically implementing the DS recommendations, and <br />&bull; the appropriate level of involvement desired and aspects that they can contribute to the studies.</p>
<p>This RFI does not invite ideas regarding the specific observing systems/solutions that are to come out of the studies. Rather we are requesting inputs and ideas on how the private sector and other non-governmental organizations can best participate in the observing system architecture studies.</p>
<p>Responses shall also include the following:<br />1. Company name and address;<br />2. Business size classification;<br />3. Information demonstrating technical capability.</p>

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

BASIS OF DESIGN / SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  Site prep and temporary utility feed will be pre-installed to the infrastructure requirements outlined in the Site Planning Guide (attached below) provided by AK Specialty Vehicles through Alliance Healthcare. The guide provides a template for trailer layout, dimensions, and utility feeds needed for their 1.0 & 1.5 Tesla, 48-foot USA MRI Unit. Similar requirements are assumed for the CT unit.

NOTE: Alliance Healthcare and/or AK Specialty Vehicles are NOT being specified as SOLE SOURCE vendor(s). However, the attached document from them was used as our basis of design for site preparation.

Contractor shall maintain qualifications throughout entire contract period.  Qualifications include but not limited to the certification of all repair persons and repair facilities by the OEM as being trained / qualified to perform required repairs.

In addition, the Altoona VAMC will provide an onsite electrician the day of delivery to ensure the power/phasing is correct. 
 
VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE: Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE:   Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:

Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or

VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.

Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The Information Security Officer (ISO) needs to maintain the documentation.

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:  Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO INCLUDE BRAND NAME COMPONENTS IN A FUTURE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR PERFORMANCE AT CLEAR, AK<br />Solicitation Number: W911KB19R0002<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Alaska
<p>Provisions set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(c)(1) authorizes the use of brand name only supplies in solicitations/contracts or as part of an acquisition when supplies may be deemed to be available only from one or a limited number of sources, and when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the USACE Alaska intends to issue a competitive fully designed military construction solicitation that will include but not limited to the following brand name only item: EDWARDS EST-360 FIRE ALARM PANEL. Specifically, the contractor awarded the competitive construction contract will be required to purchase the above noted brand name Critical System(s) in support of the planned construction acquisition. This brand name item is required for compatibility with the other existing buildings on the Air Force Station in order to ensure effective and seamless attention to critical life and fire systems. All buildings at the installation at Clear, AK have to have a fully integrated building automation system. The use of the original manufacturer of materials and components is required to prevent issues of system functionality and extensive additional costs. The use of any other manufacturer could cause a need to replace in essence complete parts and accessories thus creating complete new systems. Therefore, the future contract will need to use brand name descriptions peculiar to one manufacturer for a specific system with whom a turn-key solution can be provided meeting all government requirements.<br />The government has already developed plans and specifications for the planned construction acquisition, and intends to utilize full and open competitive procedures for the future solicitation/contract of the construction project requiring the brand name only component(s). The future solicitation will be numbered as W911KB19R0002. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the construction project is 236220 with a small business size in dollars of $36.5M. Parties may identify their interest in providing a equal to the brand name or brand name distribution and submit clearly articulated product information, vendor/distributor information. Product information lacking the particular features that do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, this agency's needs cannot be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice of intent to include brand name component within the construction acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to include a statement of brand name or equal for the planned future competitive construction procurement. Interested firms may submit their interest and information from the date of this notice until 2:00 PM Alaska Time on 14 September 2018 via email to Ms. Kim Tripp at Kimberly.tripp@usace.army.mil with a copy furnished to Mr. Aldone Graham at aldone.r.graham@usace.army.mil. Any electronically submitted files by Email CANNOT EXCEED this Agency's size limit of 10MB (includes email and its attachment); files exceeding this size will be denied access to our email inbox. It is the responsibility of your firm to determine the size of its electronic file. The posting of this Notice satisfies the provisions set forth at FAR Subpart 5.2 for notice of intent to include brand name specifications in planned construction acquisition and the DFARS 206.302-1 PGI. The Point of Contact for this Notice is Kim Tripp at 907-753-2549.</p>

Background/Introduction.  The Community Nursing Home (CNH) program is a key component of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuum of care.  The Contractor agrees to provide in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Alexandria Health Care System, in Alexandria, LA at the prices specified in the section titled Schedule of Items of this IDC.    Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall cooperate with VA staff in referral of appropriate veterans for care and accept veterans of which they have the capability/capacity to care.    The term,  facilities,  shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas. VA shall have the right to inspect the CNH and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.  

Requirements
 
1. General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

2. Termination of Services. VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the CNH at any time when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients without additional costs to the Government.

3.  VA Authorizations.  Authorization for nursing home care will be submitted on VA Form 10-7078,  Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services.   Each authorization validity period will be noted on the VA Form 10-7078 with a beginning and end date.  Any extension to the original authorization validity period, regardless of the number of days, requires a new VA Form 10-7078.

4. Medicaid-Based Rates.  The current State Medicaid rates may be used as a basis for determination of VA rates.  The VA rate will include medical care, routine medications, laboratory, x-ray, therapy (ies), and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically exempted.  VA will contract for appropriate Medicaid categories of care using Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV) as a guide.  As with Medicare, a description of the RUG-IV systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et al.  

5. Primary Medical Coverage.  The assigned CNH provider is the primary medical provider during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the CNH.  The CNH provider is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Provider visits will be according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.  The assigned nursing home provider will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care; arranging easy access to VA staff for consultation; providing timely response to calls and arranging for timely provider back-up according to OBRA guidelines (42 CFR 483.40, OBRA Guidelines).

6.  Rehabilitation Criteria.     All therapy provided under this IDC will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  Therapy may require pre-approval by VA before services are provided.   Medical Restorative criteria will be used for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Therapy must be skilled, relate to safety and be restorative according to Medicare criteria.  

Description of Rehabilitative Therapy. The concept of rehabilitative therapy includes recovery or improvement in function and, when possible, restoration to a previous level of health and well-being. Therefore, evaluation, re-evaluation and assessment documented in the Progress Report should describe objective measurements which, when compared, show improvements in function, or decrease in severity, or justification for an optimistic outlook to justify continued treatment.  Covered therapy services shall be rehabilitative therapy services unless they meet the criteria for maintenance therapy requiring the skills of a therapist.  

Evaluations/re-evaluations should consider the following:  Establishment of treatment goals specific to the patient s disability or dysfunction and designed to specifically address each problem identified in the evaluation; design of a plan of care addressing the patient s disorder, including establishment of procedures to obtain goals, determining the frequency and intensity of treatment; continued assessment and analysis during implementation of the services at regular intervals; instruction leading to establishment of compensatory skills; selection of devices to replace or augment a function (e.g., for use as an alternative communication system and short-term training on use of the device or system); and patient and family training to augment rehabilitative treatment or establish a maintenance program. Education of staff and family should be ongoing.

7. Emergency Care; Financial Responsibility; Advanced Directives. In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident.  Advance directives or living wills shall be adhered to according to CNH physician s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is contacted by the private hospital provider within 72-hours of admission on the first business day following a weekend or holiday.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care.

8. HIPAA Compliance.  HIPAA compliance is required.  The Contractor must adhere to the 
provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health
Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health
information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance
with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
with VA, but VACO has recognized CNH Facilities as an entity that does not require a BAA as long as they are conducting health care on VA s behalf.  The CNH care program qualifies as a medical service, so no BAA is required.

9.  State Licensure; Access to CNH Quality of Care Reports (QASP Indicator #1).  The CNH must maintain a current and unrestricted state license to operate as a skilled nursing facility.  Changes in the status of the licensure will be immediately reported to the Alexandria VA Home and Community Care Department at 318-466-2431.  VA will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this IDC, through one or any combination of the following methods:  reviews of State agencies reports; on-site inspection of the CNH by VA staff; and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients. The CNH shall provide VA with copies of all State agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA s quality improvement or quality assurance program functions relating to this IDC, including VA s on-site inspection and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the Contractor s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

10. Corrective Action Plan (QASP Indicator #2).  The CNH will cooperate with timely development of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) related to identified deficiencies and related to State, Federal or VA surveys.  The CNH will develop in the time period specified by VA timely and appropriate CAPs for VA surveys or investigation of complaints related to quality of care or sentinel events.  The CNH will also supply related documents or data as specified by VA.  The CAPs will include but are not limited to the following criteria and shall:
 
contain elements detailing how the CNH will correct the deficiency as it relates to the individual;
indicate how the CNH will act to protect residents in similar situations;
Include the measures the CNH will take or systems that will be altered to ensure that the problem will not recur.  The CNH must look at the system and determine if a change to the existing system will work, if a new system is necessary, or if a system does not exist and must be developed;
Indicate how the CNH plans to monitor performance to make sure that solutions are permanent.  The CNH must develop a quality assurance tool for ensuring that correction is achieved and sustained.  This tool must be implemented.  Failure to implement a quality assurance tool to sustain compliance will reflect that the CNH has an ineffective quality assurance system; and
Provide dates when corrective action will be completed.

11.  Life Safety Code. The CNH s building shall conform to the most recent standards of the Life Safety Code (National Fire Protection Association Standard #101) in effect on the date of the IDC award and compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. The administrator of the CNH is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility which were in existence at the time this IDC became effective.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Safety Manager responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of the CNH and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval or disapproval of the CNH to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.  These changes may include but are not limited to: 

Interior changes requiring VA approval. Some examples of facility changes that require the VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows:   interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen or trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls or doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems;

Automatic sprinkler system.  All VA contracted CNH facilities are to be fully-equipped with a fully-automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association s (NFPA) standards and be 100% sprinkler;

Natural disasters.  In the event of a natural disaster (flood, tornado, etc.), the CNH shall communicate all action plans to VA.  The action plans will at a minimum identify temporary transfers of location, dates, and names of veterans transferred; and

Major construction; additions; and renovations. Major construction including building additions or other renovations which may affect physical plant integrity; SHALL MEET latest NFPA 101 Life/Safety Code requirements as well as any additional VA CNH construction standards in place at time of renovation or alteration.  

12. Acceptable Safety and Sanitation Practices.  Acceptable safety and sanitation practices shall be observed throughout the facility.  The CNH will address employee and patient safety practices through staff orientation, training and adherence to related policy or procedures to provide a safe and clean environment.

13.  Re-admission to the VA Hospital and Emergency Care; Notification of Death of Veterans; CNH Responsibility to Veteran s Belongings or Personal Effects (QASP Indicator #3).  VA beneficiaries who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  

When such an admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72-ours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility and notice of any veteran death within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, readmission to a VA Medical Center may be accomplished as soon as the patient s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to a VA Medical Center.  

In the event of a death of any veteran, the Contractor agrees to notify VA immediately of the death.  In the event a death of a VA beneficiary while receiving nursing home care under this IDC, the CNH will promptly notify the VA facility which authorized admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient s personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the CNH shall be delivered by the CNH to the person(s) entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the CNH for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases, the CNH will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.  CMS regulations require retention of records for five (5) years when there is no requirement in State law.

14. Leave of Absence (LOA)   Bed-Hold Statement. For re-hospitalizations or therapeutic passes, VA will pay a bed hold.  Therapeutic passes will be authorized by the CNH staff based on individual patient needs, but are generally limited to two (2) times per month and should be pre-approved.  VA will cover bed holds based on the following plan: 

 The host VA medical center will select one of the following options:
 
2 days/episode, pre-approved by VA when in the best interest of the Veteran and VA. Exceptions approved at VAMC level;

Bed-hold will begin the date the resident leaves the CNH and full per diem will resume on the date of readmission to the CNH.  Absences of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility require a new authorization agreement.  The nursing home is responsible to notify the family if a bed hold is required for a longer period.  The family would then make arrangements with the home to hold the bed.  

15. Reportable Events (QASP Indicator #4). VA requires CNHs to report to the CNH Coordinator at VA any of the following events within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday:  
Sentinel events; 
When there is a change of ownership of the CNH; 
When there is a change of nursing home administrator or Director of Nursing/Director of Nursing Service; 
substantiated allegations of mistreatment, neglect, abuse or misappropriation of CNH veterans or property; 
Elopements of CNH veterans pursuant to state regulations; 
Infectious outbreaks; 
Resident to resident or resident to staff altercations involving a CNH veteran resulting in any injury that is other than minor; 
Copies of annual surveys or substantiated complaint investigations conducted by a State oversight agency; and 
Adverse events.  Reporting shall include date of occurrence and patient disposition and outcome.  

A sentinel event may include, but is not limited to the following:  
A fall resulting in death or injury; 
Elopement resulting in a missing patient; 
Patient abuse confirmed or under suspicion; 
A medication error resulting in patient illness or injury; 
Death or patient injury related to restraint (including side rails) use; or 
Death related to an unconfirmed or suspicious cause.   

When an adverse event occurs involving a CNH Veteran which is not determined to be a Sentinel Event (but that the State requires that the occurrence be reported to the State), such event is also to be reported to VA s CNH program office.  Some adverse events, such as minor medication errors without catastrophic outcomes, are managed by the CNH in the context of their quality improvement programs.  It is not necessary for nursing homes to report such incidents to the CNH program office.

16.  VA Actions Regarding Serious Quality of Care Deficiencies.  In cases of serious deficiencies affecting the health or safety of veterans or in cases of continued uncorrected deficiencies, VA will take one or more of the following actions in accordance with the terms and clauses of the IDC and applicable procurement regulations:

Increase VA staffing monitoring until the State survey agency clears the deficiency;
Suspend placement of veterans in the CNH;
Remove or transfer veterans under the IDC from the subject CNH;
Not renew the IDC; and/or
Terminate the IDC.
 
17.  VA Staff Access to CNH Records (QASP Indicator #5).  All medical records concerning the veteran s care in the CNH will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or the death of a patient, medical records will be retained by the CNH for a period of at least five (5) years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C.  552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following:

c. Clinical Record Safeguards: The CNH must safeguard clinical record information against loss, destruction, or unauthorized use. If the CNH maintains a veteran s record by computer, electronic signatures are acceptable.  If attestation is done on computer records, safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and to provide for reconstruction of information must be in place.

18.  Specialty Services.  The CNH will assume responsibility for arranging specialty care for veterans (e.g., dental care, podiatry and ophthalmology).

VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the CNH as outlined in this IDC.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the CNH but not the day the recipient leaves a CNH unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one (1) day.

23.  VA Payments.   Payments made by VA under any contract pursuant to this IDC, constitute the total cost of nursing home care.  No additional charges will be billed to Medicare (with the exception of hospice), Medicaid, or private insurance, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the CNH or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) will not be billed for uncovered services or costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double-billing and Federal fraud.

Vendors who bill electronically using the HIPAA-compliant claims transactions must submit claims through the VA clearinghouse, Emdeon, using payer ID number 12115 for medical claims.

Vendors who are not able to use the HIPAA-compliant transactions are not required to do so.  Supporting information for monthly invoices will be mailed to:

STATEMENT OF WORK

VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System
Pharmacy Service

Purpose:

The Pharmacy Service is a vital clinical service within VA Sierra Nevada Healthcare System providing pharmaceutical care and medication dispensing services to our veteran population. VASNHCS currently leases medication dispensing cubies which are placed throughout our entire healthcare system. VASNHCS need to renew the maintenance and lease agreement for automated dispensing system that supports decentralized medication management. Barcode scanning feature helps ensure accurate dispensing of medications.  Dispensing units also include a feature to prevent loading of the wrong medication and include active alerts to provide an added safety precaution for high risk medications.

Performance of Work: 

Streamlines medication distribution and workflow, providing more time to focus on patients and clinical activities. 

Improves nursing and pharmacy collaboration.  Orders and order status are transmitted electronically so information is readily accessible.  

Supports Joint Commission and regulatory compliance efforts. Protects against unauthorized access, documents use, promotes pharmacist order review, provides patient education material. 

Features to prevent loading of the wrong medication and active alerts to provide an added safety precaution for high risk medications.

Integrates CPRS and Vista systems.  Enhances patient throughput, narcotics management and pharmacy operations. 

Helps starts patient therapies faster by reducing time to first dose.  Ensures medications are available in care areas, even after hours. 

Reduces risk of harm early in the medication process by warning clinicians about potential errors before they reach the bedside.  Limits access to a single dose and provides information on medication use.  

Must contain a  CUBIE system  that are able to store a variety of medication sizes.  The CUBIE system assists nursing and pharmacy staff to deliver the correct medication to the correct patient at the right time. Supporting the rapid initiation of medication orders, the system helps hospitals reduce the risk of medication errors, diversion and non-value activities.

For quick but secure access, medstations have a biometric ID system. 

Collects data and maintains accurate records to help the facility increase charge capture and manage costs.  There is a comprehensive menu of reports and the ability to create custom reports.

Supports process improvement with information and tools to enhance safety and productivity. 

Security Clause: 

GENERAL 

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 

The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 

Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 

Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 

The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 

The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 

Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 

Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). 

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.

date of occurrence; 
data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

Notification; 
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
