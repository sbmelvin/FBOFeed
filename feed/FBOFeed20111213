The Battlefield Operational Support System (BOSS) is a Test and Simulation Tool used for stimulating and communicating on the Link 16 tactical data link via RF, Serial and Ethernet connections.  It provides individual software modules that perform Terminal (radio) Control, Terminal Emulation, Situation Display, Scenario Generation and Message Recording/Analysis capabilities.  This tool is currently used to perform Terminal Control on a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT)-1 radio and is provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AH-64D System Integration Lab (SIL) in Boeing located in Mesa, AZ.

<DESC>Dear Valued Suppliers:
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e). It is not a request for proposal and does not constitute a solicitation. No proposals or unsolicited proposals will be accepted. All information received in response, however, will be handled as Proprietary Information in the same manner as an offer. The Government will not pay for any information received under or associated with this RFI. Any expenses associated with a response are the sole responsibility of the responder. Responses will not be returned. Any pricing or cost information received will be non-binding and used for informational purposes only. Failure to respond will not in any way prevent a potential offeror from participation in future solicitations. The purpose of this RFI is to seek the input of DLA Troop Support's commercial industry partners, therefore participation is encouraged. All information provided will be given consideration and may influence the development of future proposal requests.</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support Subsistence Prime Vendor Program is interested in your comments regarding the establishment (via a competed solicitation) of a subsistence prime vendor foodservice distributor presence at the US Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba ("GTMO"). Specifically, the requirement would be for a foodservice distributor to establish a semi-permanent base of operations at GTMO, to last for the length of the contract (up to five years). The purpose of this contractor presence would be to manage its commercial food inventory for delivery to the military and DoD customers at GTMO, utilizing existing government warehouse facilities. Presently, commercial food products are supplied to GTMO by barge via Jacksonville, FL. The government takes possession at the port and the product is stored and managed by military personnel at GTMO. In future, this approach may change so that a prime vendor contractor would receive its own product (after transportation from CONUS) store it, manage inventory, fill orders and deliver product to the end users. Orders are to be filled at a minimum 98% fill rate. The estimated annual dollar value of sales based on recent usage is $7 million. A Contracting Officer Representative (COR) would also be onsite at GTMO to oversee the contract.</p>
<p>Relevant facts:</p>
<p>Stock Assortment:<br />Items to be stored and managed would consist of commercial subsistence items to support a Navy Master Load List (MLL) tailored to the requirements of the GTMO customers. Current number of line items on the Subsistence Total Order and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) is 275. No cleaning or chemical items. No special packaging or marking required. In addition to the normal full-line prime vendor subsistence items, GTMO also uses other items which are considered Government Furnished Property (GFM). These items include Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (FFV), UHT milk, frozen bread, Meals Ready to Eat (MRE's) and Ration items. These items would continue to be procured by DLA Troop Support from third party commercial sources, and transported to GTMO via barge from Florida or via airlift from Norfolk, VA. The prime vendor would be responsible for receiving items, managing the inventory, and filling orders for these items.</p>
<p><br />Ordering/Receipting:<br />Orders and receipts are sent through STORES, the same as other prime vendor contracts.</p>
<p>Customer profile:<br />There are five major customers which includes USN and USCG ships. All are located within a 3 mile radius. The ships customers are a summary of several independent ships. Deliveries are made on a skip-day basis (ex: order Monday for Wednesday delivery). Deliveries are scheduled on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays with limited weekend deliveries based on Fleet operational schedule. In 2010 there were deliveries made on 278 days (generally not on weekends) with an average of 68 line items ordered per day. In 2011, through 30 September, there were deliveries made on 197 days with an average of 58 line items ordered per day.</p>
<p>Warehouse facilities: <br />Condition: fair<br />Dry space: 34,320 sq feet &amp; 3,625 sq feet (497 pallets) <br />Freezer space: 26,904 sq feet (230 pallets) &amp; 24,000 sq feet (200 pallets)<br />Chill space: 1,620 sq feet (50 pallets)<br />Loading dock: shared facilities</p>
<p>Electrical outlets/lighting:<br />The warehouse facilities include sufficient electrical outlets and lighting. Exterior reefer plugs for 22 reefer units.</p>
<p>Utilities:<br />The Government would provide and pay for utilities (electricity, fresh water, toilet facilities, sewer, local telephone service) required for the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Warehouse maintenance:<br />For minor day to day maintenance (except as stated below), the prime vendor would be responsible for maintaining the general cleanliness of the facilities including the surrounding grounds. The US Government maintains separate contracts for trash/custodial services and regular grounds maintenance such as grass cutting and landscaping. The US Government is also responsible for major structural maintenance. However, the prime vendor would be liable for the cost of maintenance/repairs as a result of damage caused by the prime vendor's negligence or misuse.</p>
<p>Capital improvements:<br />Any modification or alteration to the government facilities desired by the prime vendor would be <br />required to be submitted in writing to and approved in advance by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). All approved modifications would be paid for by the prime vendor, and would remain the property of the US Government after completion of the contract.</p>
<p>Security:<br />Adequate security and fire protection for the warehouse facilities exists, and the base is appropriately secure.</p>
<p>Labor:<br />Providing the personnel to perform the work necessary for the contract would be the responsibility of the prime vendor. All contractor employees and are required to be US citizens and subject to mandatory clearance procedures and approval. Housing facilities for contractor personnel are available. Dependents are authorized and DoD schools are available for a fee of approximately $20K per student per year.</p>
<p>Equipment:<br />Equipment for use in the warehouse, including forklifts, would be provided by the prime vendor. Three to four forklifts would be required. RFID scanners are not included in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Delivery vehicles:<br />Delivery vehicles would be provided by the prime vendor. Vehicles may be barged to GTMO at a current cost of $405 per metric ton.</p>
<p>Fuel:<br />Prime vendor is responsible for purchasing fuel. Fuel is available for purchase for both business and personal use from the US Government, at existing gas stations at GTMO.</p>
<p>Given the information provided above, please share your ideas on the feasibility of this initiative. We encourage your participation. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding this proposal will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via mail or email, by 6 January 2012 at 3:00 p.m. EST to the following email or physical address:</p>

<DESC>STATUS UPDATE ON SWIM SEGMENT 2 SWIM The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program is a National Airspace System (NAS) advanced Information Technology (IT) infrastructure program that supports Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals. The program is transforming the NAS into an agile, information-centric system by creating a common, comprehensive framework that allows authorized users to share data within and outside the NAS.SWIM is being deployed in segments. In each segment, strategically selected NAS applications are developed and integrated into SWIM. SWIM Core Services will be added, as required, to support the implementation capabilities associated with each segment. These Core Services will enable other NAS programs to request and receive information when they need it, subscribe for automatic data receipt, and publish information and services as appropriate. STRATEGYInitially, SWIM anticipated awarding a comprehensive contract to meet the needs of providing the Segment 2 Core Services, which include: 	Messaging, 	Interface Management, 	Enterprise Service Management (ESM), and 	Security. Segment 2 is currently being re-evaluated and re-planned to take advantage of services available under FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI). SWIM will meet its Messaging Core Service need with the FTI-provided NAS Enterprise Messaging Service (NEMS). Consequently, SWIM does not plan to award a contract for Messaging.Interface Management, ESM, and Security requirements are currently under evaluation. Industry should expect market surveys relative to these requirements to ensure all technology options are considered. PLANNED ACTIVITIESThe SWIM Program Office still foresees potential contracting opportunities for each of the remaining Core Services; however, the size or time frame of those procurements is not yet clear. Additional opportunities may exist to support other service areas. The SWIM Program Office will continue to actively engage industry and seek comments and inputs on strategies, concepts, and program requirements.FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAs information becomes available, it will be posted to the SWIM website (www.faa.gov/nextgen/swim) and the FAA Contracting Opportunities website (faaco.faa.gov).If you have questions or require more information please contact Mr. Michael Sheckels, Contracting Specialist, via email at michael.sheckels@faa.gov.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENTPROJECT TITLE:  	MARKET SURVEY FOR SELEX SYSTEM INTEGRATION, INC. ILS/DME EQUIPMENT TRAINING
1.	Background
The FAA is charged with maintaining the safest, most efficient airspace system in the world. The National Airspace System (NAS) consists of a complex collection of systems, procedures, facilities, aircraft, and people. The NAS and the technologies it uses are constantly evolving. With increasing demand for flights in limited airspace, the FAA is constantly working to balance demand and capacity by minimizing delays and congestion while maximizing volume. The Air Traffic Organization represents the Terminal, En Route, System Operations, and Technical Operations workforces that ensure safety and efficiency within the NAS. The Technical Operations workforce includes those charged with installation, testing, troubleshooting, repair, monitoring, and certification of systems and equipment used to maintain the NAS.  As Technical Operations hires new employees to ensure its facilities are safely staffed for the air traffic of tomorrow, the Office of Technical Operations Training Administration serves as a bridge to the future by providing technical training programs that meet requirements set by the operational service units.
2.	Introduction/Purpose
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to maintain its resource base of technicians educated to maintain and repair existing Instrument Landing System (ILS)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) provided by Selex System Integration, Inc. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ILS/DME equipment, purchased by Selex Systems Integration, Inc., in multiple sites throughout the United States.  Technicians trained to repair and maintain this equipment are critical to preserve a healthy building environment sufficient for housing personnel.  The goal is to train FAA technicians on the Selex Systems Integration, Inc. ILS/DME equipment; to provide an introduction to the equipment by explaining the composition, function and components; and to provide instruction on equipment processes, repair and maintenance.
The FAA has a suitable vendor to provide delivery of training to our technicians on this proprietary equipment for the following courses.

The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for a clinical products center that will obtain, store, and deliver investigational agents to the appropriate clinical trials sites and personnel for DAIT-supported clinical trials, primarily those conducted by the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The center will be a central location for the receipt, storage, repackaging, labeling, and distribution of study products in accordance with federal regulations governing investigational agents.<br />Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. This includes support for clinical research programs and individual research projects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.<br />DAIT's largest clinical research program, the Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance (hereinafter referred to as the ITN), is carried out under a contract to the University of California, San Francisco. Established in FY 1999, a critical component of the ITN's mission involves the design and conduct Phase I-IV clinical trials of investigational approaches intended to lead to a functional state of immune tolerance in three clinical areas: autoimmune diseases; asthma and allergic diseases; and immune-mediated rejection of transplanted solid organs, tissues and cells. <br />The current contract provides DAIT with centralized services for the receipt, storage, packaging/repackaging, manufacture of placebo, preparation of serial dilutions, labeling, distribution, inventory and disposal of study products for clinical trials conducted by the ITN. <br />The purpose of this contract is to continue these services for the ITN and expand the scope of services provided to include DAIT-supported, investigator-initiated clinical trials conducted under cooperative agreement grants, as well as other DAIT-funded clinical research programs on a limited, as-needed basis. <br />The following three Mandatory Qualification Criteria (MQC) must be met at the time of receipt of the Original Proposal. <br />Offerors must have a permit to purchase and distribute drug products; 2.) staff must include a licensed pharmacist able to purchase and distribute drug products and; 3.) offerors must currently have or have had within the past 12 months the appropriate permits and/or licenses to import and export drug products.</p>

The Government estimates the effort to perform the base requirements of the Statement of Work (Year 1 and Option 1 - additional Years 2 through 7) to be approximately 2.0 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year. Additionally, the anticipated contract award will contain options for increased levels of effort in increments of 10% over the base requirement which can be exercised up to 10 times per contract year. An option for electronic data submission to an internal DAIT-wide system will be included as well. The Government estimates a 10% increase in the total level of effort for this optional activity during the applicable 6-month period. An option for study product validation and identity testing will also be included. The Government estimated a one-time, 12-month 10% increase in the total level of effort for this option.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about November 18, 2010 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USGS Western Fisheries Research Center, (WFRC) Seattle, WA is seeking a vendor to install two Freon leak detector sensors in the USGS cooler room and install a cooling tower treatment system to match an existing USGS owned tower.  During a 2008 Condition Assessment site visit at the WFRC it was noted that the chiller room emergency ventilation system lacks automatic controls.
In addition, an existing cooling tower chemical treatment system is inoperable. This treatment is critical to prevent scaling, corrosion, bacterial growths, and sludge from accumulating internally within the two Evapco cooling towers. The USGS operates two new Evapco cooling towers which were installed in 2008 and 2010. The Pulse Pure chemical-free cooling tower treatment system is a product of Evapco and is guaranteed to keep their cooling towers free of scaling, corrosion, bacterial growth, and sludge accumulation. This is a brand name specific requirement. Failures attributed to scaling and corrosion can be catastrophic, leading to costly downtime for repairs and equipment replacement, personal discomfort, and pose a direct threat to the mission essential aquatic experimentation at the WFRC.     This project will provide the necessary personnel, equipment, and materials required to install one (1) chiller room Freon refrigerant detection system which includes; one (1) monitor module unit and two (2) local sensors in the chiller room at the WFRC.     This project will also provide the necessary personnel, equipment, and materials required to install two (2) 4 Pulse~Pure chemical free water treatment units to service both Evapco cooling towers at the WFRC.  This is a brand name specific requirement.
The contractor will provide all equipment and man power necessary to install the Freon detection system and to replace the cooling tower water treatment system. 
Due to the highly critical nature of the cooling towers and the systems they support, the contractor must ensure any downtime of the cooling towers is preapproved by the USGS and must be kept to a minimum. 
The following replacement shall include the following: 1.	Project administration and safety2.	Provide a project timeline and work schedule 3.	Provide and install one (1) Freon leak detection module4.	Provide and install two (2) Freon leak detection sensors in the chiller room5.	Ensure operation of the two sensors are fully integrated and operational with the detection module6.	Provide and install two (2) 4 Pulse~Pure chemical free water treatment units which will replace an existing chemical treatment system located in room W-201 in the Wet Laboratory7.	Start-up and system verification8.	Provide a one year service agreement with purchase of water treatment system which shall include;a.	Total of twelve (12) site visits conducted monthly to clean, test, and calibrate equipmentb.	Verify proper operationc.	Verify blow down controller conductivity sensor calibration. Clean and recalibrate as necessaryd.	Manage water quality in both cooling towers. Field test pH and conductivity of watere.	Take field biological dip-slide test as neededf.	Inspect general condition of interior and exterior protective finishes and metal surfaces of both towersg.	Clean fan screensh.	Inspect condenser, make-up water, and conductivity sensors for proper operation9.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 8.5pt">Further, SRI has research, proprietary arts, trade secret technology not open to the public that they use in fish barrier designs and components therein; thereby making SRI the only source capable of satisfying the government's requirements of this proposed contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 8.5pt">In this regard, it is deemed necessary to obtain the services from the original source (SRI) to continue an agile operation of the Barrier without disruption and to avoid a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered by way of competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the government cannot afford any delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements since the Barrier project protects the ecosystem from two species of Asian carp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The massive and voracious fish, which can grow to 4 feet long and weigh 100 pounds, are known for their ability to leap up to 8 feet out of the water as motor boats speed by, injuring fishermen. Scientists fear that the fish, which can eat the equivalent of 40 percent of their body weight every day, could damage the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, which is the largest fresh water system on earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 8.5pt">Under the proposed contract, all work will be completed by&nbsp;September 30, 2012. The contract will result in a firm-fixed price services contract. </span></p>

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein.<br />&nbsp;<br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 898 each "C-130 Disc, Brakes" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the C-130. The C-130 Disc, Brakes are considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the brake system. Brake systems are designed to let the heat out a certain way so that things cool quickly without causing some of the surrounding components (brake housing, wheels, etc.) to get too hot which would result in a failure. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the Disc, Brake it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. That is why it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Meggitt Aircraft Braking System's own expense. Since the data required to manufacture the C-130 Disc, Brakes are limited to Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the entire C-130 wheel and brake package at their own expense. It should also be noted that the current C-130 Disc, Brake (NSN 1630 010054188/Part Number 5002564) will be phased out within the next two to three years, in favor of a newer carbon brake. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br /><br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.
<p>NSN: 1630-01-005-4188<br />Part Number: 5002564<br />Noun: Disc, Brake<br />System: C-130<br />Quantity: 898 <br />PR: Multiple Purchase Requests as Required</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.<br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify improved methods of load carriage for law enforcement officers. NSRDEC's National Protection Center (NPC) is conducting this effort on behalf of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).  Currently the Sam Browne Style Duty Belt, in several variants, is the most commonly worn duty belt by law enforcement officers in the U.S.  The number of tools each officer must carry has grown in recent history, yet the amount of space and means to carry this equipment has changed very little.  The objective of this program is to identify potential improvements to safety and operational effectiveness for Law Enforcement Officers by researching commercially available alternatives to the stand-alone duty belt.  Potential solutions will allow officers to more effectively and efficiently carry a load consisting of the following generic items:<br><br>- Handgun with holster<br>- 2 ammunition magazines<br>- 2 pairs of handcuffs<br>- Expandable baton<br>- OC spray canister <br>- Portable radio<br>- Electro-muscular disruption weapon (e.g., taser)<br>- Cellular phone<br>- Medical gloves<br>- Large flashlight<br>- Keys<br><br>Potential characteristics for improved operational suitability and effectiveness include, but are not limited to:<br><br>- Enhanced load distribution about the officer's body, avoiding localization about the waist.<br><br>- Improved vehicle interface by allowing officers to maximize the contact area between their back and a patrol vehicle seat.<br><br>- Reduced weight of belt, pockets and pouches.<br><br>- Consolidation of the equipment listed above.<br><br>- Increased area for effective load carriage.<br><br>All submissions should include a detailed description of the technology and the resultant improvement.  Data should be provided where available to support claims of improved safety, comfort, or operational suitability and effectiveness.  In addition, detailed images of the technology for inclusion in the final report are requested.<br><br>This information will be evaluated by the program office, NPC.  The result of this program will be a detailed report to NIJ capturing desired functional load carriage characteristics, and potential technologies that may improve the safety, comfort, or operational effectiveness of the law enforcement officer.  <br><br>This survey is open to all sources, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses. The sourcing of material will need to be identified since individual state and local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials or garments.<br><br>Respondents to this request for information shall submit:<br><br>1. A physical description of the solution for improved law enforcement load carriage and the enabling mechanisms.  Dimensional characteristics such as belt lengths, widths, thickness, and weight are desired.<br><br>2. Any scientific data gathered to support claims of improved performance or improved operational suitability and effectiveness.<br><br>3. Any available user feedback supporting claims of improved performance or operational suitability and effectiveness.<br><br>4. Detailed images of the solutions for use as illustrative examples in final reporting.<br><br>5.  Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format, however jpeg images are acceptable to illustrate product details.<br><br>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request.  Submission of information or samples is voluntary.  Any proprietary information will be held confidential.  Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled veteran owned small business.  Large business concerns are not prohibited from responding to this announcement. <br><br>There is no planned procurement action that will accompany this program.<br>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than 23 JAN 2012, 3:00 p.m. EST. Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers. All interested business concerns responding to this announcement shall send their submission to Matthew Hurley via email at matt.hurley@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting market research to identify potential sources to provide the following support services to the Systems Engineering Directorate:
 Training Gap analysis of existing training material Train-the-Trainer
The Systems Engineering Directorate is looking for both a tailored training solution to teach Requirements Elicitation to meet ARDECs needs, as well as a peer review of the existing Systems Engineering (SE) curriculum.  Development of the training material, along with a Train-the-Trainer of the material will be necessary. The peer review of the current material will help SED to improve their existing SE training capability to ultimately help ARDEC employees better understand how to perform Systems Engineering on their projects to reduce costs, meet schedules and increase performance of their products.  Although the elicitation of requirements is an absolute necessity to a Systems Engineer, it will also be crucial to any Integrated Project Team (IPT) member with collecting the correct data from stakeholders. Interested sources must have knowledge and experience in the elicitation of requirements and experience in training/instructing. The trainer for the Train-the-Trainer package will have knowledge of how to provide guidance to develop a trainee into a trainer. The objective is to ensure the trainee can bring the material alive in a way that facilitates optimum knowledge transfer when they become the in-house trainer for ARDEC employees.  Interested sources should provide a brief description of information relative to knowledge/abilities to provide the technical support sought, and provide a point of contact for questions. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330.
Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and provide information of previous experience related to this type of work.  The information provided will not be return. All data should be sent at no cost to the US Government NO LATER THAN January 13, 2012 to the US Army ARDEC. ATTN: Margaret Stroynowski ACC-NJ-JA Bldg 45C Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000, email: margaret.stroynowski@us.army.mil. In addition, please provide the firms name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large).  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email. This is a market survey to be used for informational planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

(U) Introduction<br />(U) This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice (FAR 15.201(e)). In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 - Requests for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this RFI. Any data provided will not be returned. This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.<br /><br />B. (U) Background<br />(U) NGA ingests large volumes of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) data to include raster and vector types transmitted via a variety of protocols. Given that, NGA, would like to understand technologies, that are currently available or in development, that can be used to efficiently ingest large data files, and provide protection capabilities against digital image-based malware.<br />(U) NGA uses various applications/systems to interface with the received data. The data must conform to stringent GEOINT standards. Any proposed process or technology must maintain these standards in the post-processed products. NGA will verify that any processing does not degrade the processed image or file.<br />(U) NGA is interested in information from Industry, Academia, and those within the Intelligence Community on approaches to mitigate any inherent risk that comes with ingesting GEOINT data. Some of those risks or threats identified via open sources include, but are not limited to: viruses, trojans, worms, insertion, altering, hiding, digital image-based steganography, and tracking. NGA is also interested in technologies or designs which can be developed or adapted to support ingest of a wide variety of file formats including imagery files.<br />(U) NGA encourages thoughtful, complete and innovative solutions to the questions in Section D. If interested parties are unable to respond to the entire RFI, NGA will accept responses to specific individual questions.<br />NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY<br />7500 GEOINT Drive<br />Springfield, VA 22150<br /><br />C. (U) Desirable Characteristics of Technology of Interest<br />(U) NGA is interested in the following technology characteristics of any proposed solution that addresses the questions in Section D:<br />&bull; (U) Modularity that allows individual services to be tailored to support multiple interfaces to web services.<br />&bull; (U) Implementation flexibility that allows individual capabilities or modules to be orchestrated based on current needs.<br />&bull; (U) Scalability that allows a mix of small and large data files (up to 10GB each) to be processed in a timely manner while supporting an overall high data volume (at least 5TB/day).<br />&bull; (U) Innovation that provides efficient data file ingest and protection from malware.<br /><br />D. (U) Information Desired<br />(U) NGA is interested in information on technical approaches to: (1) Mitigate any inherent risk that comes with ingesting GEOINT data and (2) Process large data volumes or bundled files (that are inherent in ingest of satellite imagery) against current and future digital image-based malware threats.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.
Pursuant to Federal acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001(a), this synopsis is being issued as a Sources Sought Notice. 
 Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) is seeking sources capable of supplying MK 58 Location Markers (FSG 13 NAICS 325998 PYRO).
The MK 58 MOD 1 Marine Location Marker is cylindrical, a maximum of 21.70 inches long and 4.94 inches in diameter.
  The marker weighs 11.50 pounds (+ /- .50 pounds).  The center of gravity is 7.93 +/- .50 inches from the base end of the marker (non-arming end of unit).  Upon water submergence, a MK 72 MOD 1 water activated battery is activated.  Current from the battery initiates a MK 13 MOD 0 electric Squib, which ignites starter composition of the first red phosphorous (RP) pyrotechnic candle.  This starter composition ignites the starter pellet which in turn ignites the first RP candle.  When the first candle is nearly burned out, its heat ignites transfer time fuses which carries ignition to the second candle starter composition.  This starter composition initiates the second RP candle in the same manner as the first.
 The required burn time is between 40-60 minutes.  The marker is armed by removal of an adhesive backed metallic foil strip.  A pull ring removes the foil strip.  A replaceable protective cover protects the ignition end of the marker in shipping and handling.
The planned contract units procured under this requirement shall be manufactured in accordance with the applicable Automated Data Lists (ADL), Specifications and Technical Drawings.  Data deliverables will not be separately priced. Contractors must be properly registered in the Governmentâ€™s Central contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to download any potential solicitation and attachments which may be issued.
  Interested parties may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.ccr.gov.  Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.  Current plans (subject to change) call for 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with First Article Units. 
It is requested that interested, experienced, qualified and potentially qualified sources submit a brief Industry Capabilities Statement demonstrating the capabilities and expertise required to perform the effort specified above.  Examples of items that would be helpful would include but are not limited to:
-Company name, CAGE Code, mailing address, point of contact, phone number and email address 
-Small Business Status for NAICS Code 325998 
-Relevant past performance information for similar work
-Quantity and price breaks along with standard delivery time
This notice is made for gathering market information and planning purposes only.

Product Effectiveness Program Functional Review, Lessons Learned, and Integration Services

I. Introduction:

This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties responding to this Sources Sought Notice.
 
The purpose of this Sources Sought is to seek interested sources (Contractors) for near-future solicitation(s) and procurement(s) for Product Effectiveness (PE) organization and assist in measuring the results of IT investments and providing guidance for future IT investments.  Responders to this Sources Sought Notice may be invited for a Vendor Information Day with the Government to provide a more comprehensive explanation of capabilities.  

These requirements include support for the following three (3) domains: 

Functional Review (FR)
Establish a collaborative quality gate and concurrence process throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to help identify and prevent problems before they become prohibitively expensive, in both time and cost, to correct.

Lessons Learned (LL)
Increase the effectiveness of VHA IT products by providing decision makers with valuable knowledge and information from previous and on-going program efforts and product implementation projects. This knowledge will support evidence-based decision making at all levels of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) by providing guidance for future IT investments by: 
1.	Capturing relevant input
2.	Facilitating an analysis of that input
3.	Storing lessons learned that are derived from that analysis
4.	Disseminating lessons learned to targeted audiences 

Product Effectiveness (PE) Integration
Coordinates and facilitates the provision of multiple services to integrate the four (4) programs within Product Effectiveness to provide an integrated service approach to PE's VHA customers.

At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  







II. Background: 

The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Clinger-Cohen Act (1996) require Federal executive agencies to measure the results of their major programs and to establish processes to measure the contribution of their Information Technology (IT) investments to mission results. The Lessons Learned (LL) Program was established March 2007 within the PE organization to assist in measuring the results of IT investments and provide guidance for future IT investments.   PE falls under Health Information Operations and Services (HIOS), under the Office of Health Information (OHI), VHA of VA.    

The PE mission is to perform independent assessments and analysis on health and business, IT and medical products, as well as program, product and process improvements to ensure they are effective and meet the needs of the customer in terms of function, business case validation, benefits realization, and end user satisfaction.  These assessments, along with collecting lessons learned for continuous processes improvements, provide VHA programs with evidenced-based information for decision support, validation and justification of investments.  

Product Effectiveness consists of four interrelated service domains along with a project integration domain.  These interrelated service domains are:  Benefits Realization (BR), Functional Review (FR), Customer Satisfaction (CS) and LL. 

III. Requirements:  A high-level description of the processes and outputs for each of the three (3) functional support areas is described below:

1) FR: The purpose of the FR Process & Procedures (See Attachment 1 - PE Documents) is to describe the procedures for administering a FR engagement to perform functionality and product usability risk assessments for VHA IT products and services. It is a detailed, step by step process by which FR services and associated deliverables shall be completed. 

The purpose of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) is to describe the concept of operations from the point of view of the program for implementing the FR service (See Attachment 1 - PE Documents). The CONOPS serves as a communication tool for the FR program and is provided to the Contractor to assist with understanding the context of the services in relation to the program. 

The following table provides alignment of projected Task Order phases with the corresponding section found in the FR Process and Procedures (P&P), and is necessary to explain the anticipated Contractor's role in providing tasks to support the program:
 
Table 1: FR Task Phases
Task Phase	FR P&P Section
1.	Due Diligence	0.0  Project Initiation
2.	Project Baseline Review	1.0  Planning Phase
3.	Baseline Operational Assessment	1.0  Planning Phase
4.	Requirements Analysis Review	2.0  Design Phase
5.	System Test Readiness Review 	3.0  Implementation Phase
6.	User Acceptance Test Readiness Review 	3.0  Implementation Phase
7.	Operational Readiness Review	4.0  Deploy Phase
8.	Product Usability Assessment and Post Implementation Review	5.0  Operations and Maintenance Phase
9.	Lessons Learned	Not Applicable to P&P*
10.	Engagement Program Management	Not Applicable to P&P**
* In Phase 9, the Contractor shall perform activities and produce a deliverable that describes the comprehensive lessons learned from the all other phases. The lessons learned shall be described in detail and answer the following questions in regard to the P&P document and the procedures actually used to successfully complete the task order.

** This phase encompasses program and project management activities, work products, and deliverables for the engagement.  Non-deliverable documentation produced in the course of providing the engagement services (during this and all other phases) are included within this Task Phase.  Required documents that are not specifically purchased as deliverables are known as "Work Products," and are considered a part of the Monthly Status Report deliverable.  Examples of such work products include meeting agendas, meeting minutes, notes, trip reports, routine presentation decks, recommended communications, and similar work products required to complete the engagement.  Work Products shall be uploaded to the PE Program SharePoint site and listed within the monthly status report deliverable.

Regarding each step of the process:

1.	What worked well?
2.	What did not work as expected and why?
3.	What was done to solve unexpected issues?
4.	What can be done to avoid these unexpected issues or leverage what worked well?
5.	Based on these lessons learned, what revisions are recommended for the FR P&P, FR CONOPS, and FR Roles and Responsibilities documents?

The Lessons Learned deliverable is an important component of PE's continuous process improvement program, and will be considered for this purpose.


2) LL: Task orders awarded under this domain shall follow the P&P for performing LL, in accordance with the LL CONOPS (See Attachment 1 - PE Documents).  

The following table provides alignment of Task Order phases with the phases found in the P&P, and is necessary to explain the Contractor's role in providing tasks to support the program:

Table 2: LL Task Order Phases
Task Order Phase	LL P&P Section
1.	Due Diligence	1.0  LL Engagement Initiation
2.	Plan LL Engagement	2.0  LL Engagement Planning
3.	LL Execution: Knowledge Management (KM)	3.0  LL Engagement Execution
4.	LL Execution: Communities of Practice (CoPs)	3.0  LL Engagement Execution
5.	Lessons Learned	4.0  LL Program Management
6.	Engagement Program Management	Not Applicable to P&P*

Note: LL Execution is separate Task Order phases to provide the ability to issue Task Orders with or without Communities of Practice support included.





* This phase encompasses program and project management activities, work products, and deliverables for the engagement.  Non-deliverable documentation produced in the course of providing the engagement services (during this and all other phases) are included within this Task Phase.  Required documents that are not specifically purchased as deliverables are known as "Work Products," and are considered a part of the Monthly Status Report deliverable.  Examples of such work products include meeting agendas, meeting minutes, notes, trip reports, routine presentation decks, recommended communications, and similar work products required to complete the engagement.  Work Products shall be uploaded to the PE Program Sharepoint site and listed within the monthly status report deliverable.

3) PE Integration Services: Task orders shall follow the P&P for performing PE engagements, in accordance with the PE P&P and CONOPS (See Attachment 1 - PE Documents).  The PE Integration services minimize impact on program customers to ensure the most efficient provision of PE services.  The Contractor shall provide project management services to assist with coordinating these services and to provide related expertise to support integrating these multiple projects into a single managed effort.  The Contractor shall support the integration of PE services to its customers through process management and documentation through the five process groups of a project, which includes Initiation, Planning, Executing, Controlling and Monitoring, and Closing.  Within these five (5) project management processes, the Contractor shall document specific details related to customer projects, called "engagements."  

The following table provides alignment of Task Order phases with the phases found in the P&P, and is necessary to explain the Contractor's role in providing tasks to support the program:

Table 8: Integration Task Order Phases
Task Order Phase	PE P&P Section
1.	Due Diligence	1.0  Pre-Engagement
2.	Plan Integration Engagement	2.0  Engagement Planning
3.	Engagement Execution	3.0  Engagement Execution
4.	Project Completion	4.0  Project Completion
5.	Lessons Learned	5.0  Continuous Improvement
6.	Engagement Program Management	Not Applicable to P&P*

* This phase encompasses program and project management activities, work products, and deliverables for the engagement.  Non-deliverable documentation produced in the course of providing the engagement services (during this and all other phases) are included within this Task Phase.  Required documents that are not specifically purchased as deliverables are known as "Work Products," and are considered a part of the Monthly Status Report deliverable.  Examples of such work products include meeting agendas, meeting minutes, notes, trip reports, routine presentation decks, recommended communications, and similar work products required to complete the engagement.  Work Products shall be uploaded to the PE Program Sharepoint site and listed within the monthly status report deliverable.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting an Proposers' Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary proposal to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement. This solicitation will be specifically for innovative multidisciplinary research proposals in the area of recombinant butyrylcholinesterase expression. The vision of the Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants program is to develop and demonstrate that recombinant butyrylcholinesterase can be expressed using a plant made pharmaceutical platform in Nicotiana benthamiana plants for a bioscavenger prophylaxis. The Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants program seeks the development and demonstration of technologies to include enzyme stabilization strategies that will result in human butyrylcholinesterase that has the properties equivalent to plasma-derived human butyrylcholinesterase in terms of pharmacokinetic stability and enzyme activity. The Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants Proposers' Day will introduce interested researchers to the details of the program, provide a forum to facilitate interaction and encourage collaboration between researchers with expertise in relevant disciplines.
<p>The Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants Proposers' Day Workshop will be held at the Executive Conference Center, Suite 300, 4075 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22203. The goals of the workshop are to: (a) introduce the research community (academia and industry) to the Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants program vision and its goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the objectives and milestones of this particular anticipated effort; and (c) encourage and promote collaborative arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants program goals. The Proposers' Day Workshop will include overview presentations by government personnel describing the specific metrics for butyrylcholinesterase production, an information session to respond to questions from participants, a poster session to facilitate interaction and collaboration among the session participants and private sidebars that can be scheduled beforehand. Additionally, an information and teaming website will be provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at https://team.sainc.com/rBuChE.</p>
<p>Potential participants should note that formation of research teams with sufficient expertise to address the objectives described in the anticipated BAA will be critical to the success of Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants program.</p>
<p>Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants Proposers' Day Workshop participants are encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and collaboration discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location and lodging are given on the registration website at is http://www.sa-meetings.com/DARPArBuCHE. The user name is DARPA and the password is Arlington (case sensitive).</p>
<p>There is no registration fee for the Butyrylcholinesterase Expression in Plants Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration is limited (maximum 45 people) by the venue capacity. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, January 17, 2011, and early registration is strongly recommended.</p>

<SOLNBR>NONE-CreditLossForecast
<RESPDATE>122811
<CONTACT>Claudia Addison, Phone 2024143835, Email claudia.addison@fhfa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to publish the intent of a sole source award to Moody's Analytics, Inc., West Chester, PA. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) intends to award a sole source contract to Moody's Analytics Inc. for Historical Database: US National and Regional and Regional Alternate Forecast Data, Moody's economy.com for five (5) FHFA users because these products support FHFA's efforts to forecast credit losses of the regulated enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). FHFA already employs the Moody's data in its credit loss forecasting platform in support of mission-critical oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, specifically using the State-Level "FHFA Purchase Only Index" and the State Level BLS Unemployment forecasts obtained via the historical and regional forecast data contained within Historical Database: US National and Regional and Regional Alternate Forecast Data, Moody's economy.com.
<p><br />FHFA's mission is to ensure effective supervision, regulation and housing mission oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks to promote their safety and soundness, support housing finance and affordable housing, and support a stable and liquid mortgage market. The forecasted series and the historical series used during model estimation must remain consistent across time, meaning the data must originate from the same source, in order to ensure integrity and continuity of the forecast, and to allow for meaningful and efficient validation of the forecast. A different vendor's database would require a significant effort on the part of FHFA to reconstruct and revalidate the existing modeling processes, and likely would result in FHFA estimates of credit losses that would not be at all comparable across time, leading to skepticism of the public in the validity of FHFA produced estimates.</p>
<p>In addition the significant additional cost associated with using a different vendor would include those costs associated with FHFA having to re-estimate all of the FHFA credit loss models. Specifically, the additional costs would have to include at a minimum, three months' time for about three FTEs. These costs alone would well exceed the price of the procurement from Moody's Analytics Inc. Additional losses would also exist in the form of having resources redirected away from other mission critical activities, and in terms of the cost associated with the interruption of FHFA being able to produce credit loss estimates on a regular basis.</p>
<p>FHFA has totally integrated the Moody's Analytics forecasts into the FHFA credit forecasting process; conducting a different vendor search and reconstructing the modeling processes would create detrimental time delays in reporting requirements and affect the consistency across time in the FHFA production of credit loss forecasts.</p>
<p>If there is any interruption in service (data availability), FHFA will not be able to produce credit loss estimates on a regularly scheduled basis, as is now the expected customary procedure and therefore FHFA could fail to meet required deadlines for reporting on the progress of the Conservatorship of the Enterprises to Congress. In addition, key research backing the development of new risk-based capital regulations will be delayed.</p>
<p>FHFA, Department of Housing Mission and Goals, Capital Policy Office was unable to locate any alternative vendors for forecasts on the FHFA purchase only index when FHFA first contracted with Moody's Analytics. These products provide FHFA with historical and 30 year forecasts of key data used in our credit default and prepayment models, and in our models that forecast credit losses under various scenarios. Moody's alone (to FHFA knowledge) generates a forecast of the FHFA Housing Price Index (even FHFA does not produce a forecast of this series), and FHFA uses the Moody forecasts of unemployment and other variables-all of which are generated under a number of scenarios, such as optimistic, expected, double-dip recession, and so on. It is imperative that FHFA use forecasts from a nationally recognized and market-tested vendor to ensure that FHFA is not building in FHFA biases in any way to the forecast data being incorporated into our model estimates. Moody's Analytics is a highly recognized national and market-tested vendor producing the databases critical to credit loss forecasting, supporting FHFA's mission to the public and Congress.</p>
<p>FHFA intends to award a follow-on purchase order for a base period of performance for 12 months, beginning February 1, 2012 through January 31, 2013. Options for such services for four additional one-year periods of performance will also be sought for inclusion in the purchase order. This subscription services is only available from its producer/manufacturer and not through dealers or distributors. Moody's Analytics Inc is the only source for this subscription service, Historical Database: US National and Regional and Regional Alternate Forecast Data, Moody's economy.com. This is an announcement of FHFA's intent to issue a purchase order to Moody's Analytics Inc. for the Historical Database: US National and Regional and Regional Alternate Forecast Data, Moody's economy.com for five (5) FHFA users; FHFA will not issue a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This notice announces a U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) Industry Day to be held on November 30, 2011 at the San Antonio Field Office located at: 8940 Fourwinds Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78239. The Industry Day will be held on the second floor of the building starting at 8:30 am and will last until approximately 12:00 pm.
<p>All business sizes are welcome to participate; however, ICE is trying to determine small business interest, specifically from HUBZones. All information received in response to this notice will be used to determine the appropriateness of any small business set-aside for this requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement: Transportation</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a continuing need for transportation services to provide, operate, and manage the transportation of detainees in ICE custody for the San Antonio Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>
<p>DO duties include but are not limited to armed transportation services, escorting detainees to and from transport vehicles, monitoring detainees in custody, and conducting limited pat-downs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish these services including management staff, supervision, manpower, relief officers, uniforms, equipment and supplies (including transport vehicles, firearms, body restraints, non-lethal devices, body armor, cellular telephones and radios) to provide transportation services for the most part during the week days. Eight routes have been identified as seven days a week. Staff shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day to ensure the routes in ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) San Antonio are performed at the appropriate frequency. The Contractor shall assign at a minimum per vehicle, two person teams of armed DOs and provide a minimum of one (1) DO of the same gender of the detainee(s) being transported.</p>
<p>Contractor DOs shall not be tied to specific routes within the contract. DOs may be used to provide transportation and guard services as needed as consistent with the job description above. However, DOs will have to have specific locations as their home-base which will determine their prevailing wage determination.</p>
<p>The estimated number of detainees to be transported may vary day to day. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the detainees are transported in the most safe and economical manner.</p>
<p>An advanced list of routes and frequencies will be provided to those attending the Industry Day. If you are not able to attend, the routes and frequencies will be provided in the RFP. The current estimate is that there are 204 routes in the San Antonio AOR listed as daily (8), week days (19) and as needed (177). Based on the estimated number of detainees per trip, it will be up to the Contractor to provide the appropriate transport vehicle (bus, van, and/or sedan).</p>
<p>Required Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>Business Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor is responsible to obtain all business permits and licenses prior to performance of the contract.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall (depending on the state's requirements) be licensed as a quality security company in accordance with the requirements of the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; Throughout the term of this contract, the Contractor shall maintain currency of ALL permits/business licenses and make them available for government inspection. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.<br />- Firearms Requirements<br />- Body Armor Requirements</p>
<p>Licensing of Employees<br />&bull; Before the commencement of services under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure each employee has the appropriate registration, commissions, permits and licenses as required by the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall verify all licenses and certifications. If applicable, Contractor staff shall posses a current license/registration for the state(s) in which they are performing.</p>

<DESC>Description:
The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate- Herndon intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, ARINC Engineering Services, to award a sole source follow-on IDIQ contract for the U.S. Army Next Generation Wireless Communications (NGWC) for Logistics Application Project to continue the development, testing and certification of the NGWC mesh network protocol.
In the initial, competitively awarded NGWC IDIQ contract, the U.S. Army Logistics Innovation Agency (LIA), conducted market and technical analysis and determined that mobile, adhoc mesh networking technology would be the initial focus for a multi-phased technical development and integration effort to deploy advanced automatic identification technology (AIT) for military use.  Further, after the initial task order, LIA determined that they would have to design and develop a new protocol in order to meet the technical, functional, and security requirements identified by the Army/DoD.  The remainder of the IDIQ effort focused largely on developing the adhoc mobile mesh network protocol and conducting testing and demonstrations of the capability in various laboratory and real-world settings.
The NGWC mesh protocol was designed specifically by Army/DoD to support continuous asset visibility globally across all military business processes.  It was also designed to be Information Assurance compliant so that the end-state capability will operate within the Army/DoD internet environment without risk to the network. 
The Army Materiel Command (AMC) has deployed the current version of the mesh network technology in Kuwait to provide continuous visibility of equipment being processed out of Iraq in support of the Presidential mandate to retrograde during the Drawdown and Reset.  Started as a proof of principle (PoP) to determine if the mesh will provide the data they needed to speed up the process and make it more efficient, Army fully deployed the mesh network protocol throughout Kuwait to enable visibility for the entire retrograde process in theater.
The initial contract, N06PC10438, was issued as a multi-phased developmental effort that the government announced would not encompass complete development and deployment, but would leave the military department in a position to determine in which direction the developmental process should continue.  The Statement of Work (SOW) in the earlier competitive announcement stated that at the end of the initial ID/IQ contract, upon the analyses of the test results, the Army would learn what would need to be addressed and what logistical gaps would have to be overcome to merge new technologies with existing technologies.  Product enhancement with a goal of perfecting interfaces based on institutional and documented knowledge from the development phases completed by the incumbent is the work to be continued and completed under the planned follow-on IDIQ, and will revolve around finalization of data packages and finalization of the standards documents.  It is not work that a successor contractor other than the incumbent can provide.  Therefore, this is not a notice of a potential opportunity to compete.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
POC:  Debra Hoffman, DOI/NBC/Acquisition Services Directorate, 381 Elden Street, Ste 4000, Herndon, VA  20170.  Responses to this notice must be emailed to debra.hoffman@aqd.nbc.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXECUTE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD<br />The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), PL8321, Scott AFB, IL, intends to issue a sole source contract to ASG Federal, Inc., 2551 Dulles View Drive STE 200, Herndon, VA 20171-5219. Intent is to award a 5 year contract with a base year and four, one year option periods. <br />The proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1) and (d)(1)(B), and regulatory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in: (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br />This requirement is to procure Allen Systems Group (ASG) Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software licenses and maintenance subscriptions for mainframe and distributed processing that support applications transmitted to or processed at the DISA Computing Services Directorate managed facilities. The ASG software acquired and maintained through this contract action will support all equipment augmentations and all government owned software-processing environments both mainframe and distributed. Only ASG, the OEM, will satisfy the agency's requirements because brand name products are required and ASG is highly specialized in providing the software maintenance required to meet the needs of DISA. At this time, it is known that only ASG products will function with the current ASG products deployed at DISA facilities and there are no known competitor functional equivalents.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />Justification is attached.

2) Reusable Sharps, each unit priced as a cost per pound or cost per gallon

ANSWER:  Price/Cost will be evaluated on total amount, to include option(s).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Timber Ridge Bison, 1350 250th Street, Waverly, IA 50677. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) , MWA, USDA at Ames, IA for 32 bison heifers less than ten (10) months of age that have not been vaccinated with brucellosis vaccines and from a single herd free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Heifers must have good eyes and be sound on feet and legs. The bison heifers are available only through Timber Ridge Bison. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Timber Ridge Bison without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). <br />USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Columbia, MO location.<br />2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).<br />a. This contracting action is to obtain 32 bison heifers to be used for research purposes. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).<br />32 bison heifers, less than 10 months of age that have not been vaccinated with brucellosis vaccines and from a single herd free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Heifers must have good eyes and be sound on feet and legs. <br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor=s Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).<br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) <br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, <br /><br />AWhen the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.@ <br />(2) The named vendor maintains NADC=s bison genetic needs and is an agreeable travel distance from the Center. Transport time has to be at a minimum due to the temperament of the bison. Bison are needed for a vaccine experiment and previous vaccine experiments have utilized bison obtained from this vendor. Obtaining bison from a different source may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiments that may lead to increased variability in immune responses and impair comparison of vaccine responses across experiments. This herd is free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a significant cause of mortality in many bison herds. Currently available diagnostics lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect infected herds or individuals. Purchase of bison with MCF would make all data from proposed experiment invalid and nonpublishable. Of equal concern would be the possibility that MCF could be inadvertently introduced into bison in other experiments (i.e. deer) at NADC; a scenario that would be devastating to several ongoing brucellosis, tuberculosis, and possibly prior research projects. Least cost procurement of bison on a previous occasion did result in procurement of MCF-positive bison. In addition, bison from this herd have some degree of human acclimation which makes them easier, and to some extent safer, to manage in NADC's current animal facilities. <br />6. Federal Business Opportunities B FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.<br />b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.<br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).<br />After a thorough web search, no other suppliers were located that could supply this consumable.<br />8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).<br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the consumable is malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) free and only available from the vendor identified. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other existing items can meet the research requirements. If competition occurs in the future and maintaining genetic consistency is not required for a given experiment, testing of additional resource herds can be performed for environmental bacteria status. Other sources will be identified if they meet the requirements for transport. Transport time has to be at a minimum due to procurement of the animal. <br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

In using the Best Value Tradeoff approach, the Government seeks to award to an offeror who gives the Best Value to the Government, meets and/or exceeds the requirements.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award.  The Government intends to award one (1) purchase order as a result of this RFP.
EVALUATION FACTORS AND EVALUATION APPROACH AREAS TO BE EVALUATED:
Appropriate consideration will be given to the three (3) evaluation factors:  Technical, Price and Past Performance.  The Technical factor is more important than Price factor which is more important than Past Performance.
TECHNICAL EVALUATION:
Technical Objectives:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror considered, defined and satisfied the requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  Offeror must receive a minimum of Acceptable to be considered for award.
The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the overall Technical Factor rating.

PRICE EVALUATION:The total evaluated price will be used in the Best Value Determination.  The Government will evaluate the overall total price to determine Fair and Reasonableness.  Price Reasonableness will be based on competition when possible.
PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:Past performance will be evaluated based on relevance of recent effort.  It shall consider similarity and complexity of a performance effort that was executed within the last 3 years.  
The ratings are as follows:
Substantial Confidence  Definition  Based on the Offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.Satisfactory Confidence  Definition  Based on the Offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.Limited Confidence  Definition  Based on the Offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.No Confidence  Definition  Based on the Offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.Unknown Confidence (Neutral)  Definition  No recent/relevant performance record is available of the Offerors performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
DEFINITIONS:Strength  is an aspect of an offerors proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contact performance.  Weakness  A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.Significant Weakness  A flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.Deficiency  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html.<BR><BR>Contractor is responsible to refuel equipment before, during, and after the lease period.  Fuel must be CARB compliant in accordance with the attached PWS.  This is a change from previously posted requirements.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor is responsible to refuel equipment before, during, and after the lease period.  Fuel must be CARB compliant in accordance with the attached PWS.  This is a change from previously posted requirements.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO. has a requirement for mid-infrared-compatible optical fiber in order to implement our superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) at mid-infrared wavelengths (3-4 microns). <br /><br />EMAIL ALL QUOTES TO: mayns@nist.gov<br />NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE<br />CLAUSES THAT APPLY TO THIS SOLICITATION ARE ATTACHED<br /><br />C-connectorized vacuum mid-infrared fiber feedthrough; and one FC-connectorized, standard telecom fiber patch cord, 2m long, with the same stainless steel jacketing as the mid-infrared fiber. <br /><br />Our SNSPDs are quite small (typically 10 microns wide, but as small as 1 micron wide) and must be operated at cryogenic temperatures (4 K or less). To couple light from a source or experiment at room temperature to the SNSPDs at cryogenic temperatures, we require optical fibers both inside and outside the cryostat, as well as a vacuum feedthrough to couple these two fibers. We have previously demonstrated these detectors to work well in the near-infrared (wavelengths &lt; 2 microns) by using conventional telecom-wavelength optical fiber (SMF-28, designed to be optimal at 1.55 micron wavelength). However, we have been unable to test SNSPDs at wavelengths&nbsp; &gt; 2 microns, because SMF-28 fiber does not transmit light at these longer wavelengths.<br /><br />TECHNICIAL SPECIFICATIONS:<br /><br />1. Two fiber patch cables, each 2 m long, that are designed to be single-mode at a wavelength of 3 microns.
<p>a. Each fiber patch cable must transmit &gt;90% of light for wavelengths of 300 nm - 4500 nm.<br />b. Fiber core must be 10 micron diameter or less.<br />c. Fiber patch cables and jackets must be compatible with cryogenic operation, down to temperatures of ~1 K.<br />d. Fiber patch cables must be robust and not break easily with normal handling. Thus we require the patch cables be encased in jackets made of stainless steel or other similarly robust material that is also compatible with cryogenic operation.</p>
<p>2. One connectorized vacuum fiber feedthrough that will be used to connect one of the fiber patch cables at room temperature (outside the cryostat, where it will be used to collect light from the experiment) with the other fiber patch cable (inside the cryostat, where it will deliver light to our detector).</p>
<p>a. Feedthrough must transmit &gt;90% of light for wavelengths of 300 nm - 4500 nm.<br />b. Feedthrough must contain the same fiber (identical materials, core diameter, and connectors) as the fiber patch cables listed above, to ensure compatibility of the full system.<br />c. Full system of one patch cable, connected to feedthrough, connected to second patch cable, must transmit &gt;90% of light for wavelengths of 300 nm - 4500 nm.</p>
<p>3. One SMF-28 fiber patch cable with the same stainless steel jacket as the patch cables in 1, to be used for testing in our cryostat. <br /><br />DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE: 4-5 weeks ARO for the mid-infrared fiber patch cables and fiber feedthrough, and 2-3 weeks ARO for the SMF-28 fiber patch cable.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager will support USAID's the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities. OTI currently has four regional teams: Asia and Middle East (AME), Afghanistan and Pakistan (Af/Pak), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). It is expected that the Senior Program Manager will provide initial assistance to DCHA/OTI's Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) team in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched its Afghanistan program in July 2009 to address instability at the local level. The mission of OTI-Afghanistan is to improve stability in strategically selected locations by supporting formal and informal Afghan governance structures. Through the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) program, OTI seeks to: improve local perception of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) legitimacy; establish and/or strengthen the link amongst GIRoA, informal governance structures and the local population; and leverage and/or empower community based resiliencies to address sources of instability. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.</p>
<p>OTI-Afghanistan's program works to facilitate community consultation, encourage GIRoA transparency and public outreach, and build Afghan capacity through fast, flexible, and targeted projects. Project activities facilitate local government engagement with communities to address grievances and enhance GIRoA's legitimacy; rehabilitate infrastructure through creation of short-term employment opportunities for which GIRoA is responsible and receives credit; support civic education programs that strengthen the relationship between formal and traditional governance mechanisms; provide technical support to local GIRoA officials and community groups including public outreach and communications training, assessments, surveys, and subject-matter experts; and build GIRoA officials' capacity to design and implement public relations campaigns and community programming following military clearing operations.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's Afghanistan/Pakistan regional team with program implementation-related activities.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) that expanded in September 2009 into priority areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The USAID/OTI program is an initial step in support of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) renewed efforts to better deliver services to communities. The GOP is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA in particular, demonstrating a renewed commitment toward the region by enhancing the role of the FATA Secretariat (FS) and attracting investment to the area through the FATA Development Authority.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the GOP's development efforts to better integrate FATA/KP into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. PTI also supports the GOP in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region's most immediate needs, which requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities in the region.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Ms Carolyn Choate, HQ AMC/A7K, 402 Scott Drive, Unit 2A2 Post 2A10, Scott AFB, IL 62225, (618) 229-0160, fax (618) 256-6668, email: carolyn.choate@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreement, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/ACQ, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause).<br /><br />Also your quote must list your DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC, and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE.<BR><BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 100015122011.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html.<BR><BR>Contractor is responsible to refuel equipment before, during, and after the lease period.  Fuel must be CARB compliant in accordance with the attached PWS.  This is a change from previously posted requirements.<BR><BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: N/A<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 1:30 PM EST on Monday December 19th, 2011 3:00 PM EST; Deadline for questions will be Friday December 16th, 2011 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

1.	In reference to the construction of the proposed building, what   materials will be used for the following interior items?A)	Flooring B)	Countertops C)	Walls Materials are as follows:A)	Flooring is concrete with epoxy paint and sealant in the counter / storeroom areas; concrete with sealant in the rest of the area.B)	Countertops are laminate: Wilsonart or equal.C)	Walls are painted drywall.  Counter and storeroom areas will have epoxy paint on walls.
2.	Pending approval by the Park Service, will there be options by the concessioner to make improvements to the grounds of the building? (i.e. Patio Seating, Shade Umbrellas/Canopies, Outdoor Foldable Advertising Stands)Yes.
3.	Is the Equipment and Fixture Schedule provided in Exhibit 12: Proposed Drawing of Concession Facilities a recommended list or a list of required equipment? These items are not required, but are an NPS estimate of what might be used; so that utilities, power, drains, and all anticipated service requirements can be met.
4.	Is it safe to assume that in Appendix 9 all references to Boat Marina activities (fuel sales, slip rentals, etc.) can be replaced by the bidder with relevant categories for bike rentals and grab-n'-go food service?Yes.  Because the NPS does not have a form that suits this specific opportunity, the boat marina activities sections on this form can be ignored or replace by the Offeror with relevant categories.  
5.	Are the temporary housing units (the brown trailers currently in the park scheduled to be removed) available for purchase by the Concessioner? There are 10 2-bedroom and 10 3-bedroom brown temporary housing units currently installed in the area where the concessioner will be assigned housing.  These are leased by the Service from a private firm, Modular Solutions.  They are scheduled for removal on April 1, 2012.  If an entity wishes to purchase one or more, it will be a private arrangement between that entity and Modular Solutions.

However, the successful Offeror would need to confirm the number of bicycles that could be hung from the ceiling with a structural engineer.
31.	Can the suggested bike storage area be enclosed and weather proofed?The Service will provide a covered roof area, only.  The successful Offeror may submit its proposal to enclose and weather proof this area, for review and approval. No leasehold surrender interest (LSI) will be awarded for this or any improvement.  
32.	Is there an opportunity to add on to the facility an enclosed storage unit?Once the contract is awarded, the successful Offeror may submit its proposal to the Park for any proposed additions to the structure.  However, it should not be assumed that such a change would be approved.  Offerors must respond to the questions as asked and all conditions as described in the Prospectus, including the Draft Contract.  
33.	Is the building air-conditioned?Yes.  
34.	In the new building, will the NPS be providing "inside wiring" or do we need to account for the cost of this wiring?  Does the building have a crawl space to run cabling or conduit installed since some of the POS locations appear to be in the middle of the floor on the provided layout?The building will be wired, per the construction drawings.  There is no crawl space. The construction is slab on grade.  There is an access panel in the ceiling.  
35.	In regards to Wi-Fi service, can we mount access points anywhere inside/outside the building or are we restricted to certain locations?  If restrictions exist, what are they?A hook up for T1 internet service will be provided and the concessioner would need to establish Wi-Fi with the service provider.  Equipment to allow access to Wi-Fi may be installed anywhere inside the building that the Concessioner selects, as long as it does not interfere with other operations.  The Service will not permit external installation.  Additionally, the Service will not approve the installation of hardwired computer jacks for use by customers. Any such jacks if approved must be for the Concessioner's business use only.  
36.	Will there be a closet set aside to house all IT equipment (routers, switches, patch panels, etc.)?  If so, how large is this space?  Is it securable (for PCI compliance), properly ventilated and have adequate HVAC?The building design team did not anticipate a significant amount of IT equipment.  There is no closet set aside for this purpose.  After award of contract, the successful Offeror may submit a proposal to the Park to install such a closet. However, Offerors should not assume that such a change would be approved.  Offerors must respond to questions as asked and to all conditions as described in the Prospectus and Draft Contract.  
37.	 Is there a CAD design drawing available for facility?A PDF is available on the NPS Commercial Services website. A link to that can be found at:  http://www.nps.gov/commercialservices/grca034-12.htm
38.	Can we get a list of the comparable bike operators that were used to set the Bicycle rates? No. The Service did not conduct a formal comparability study for the rates listed in the Prospectus. The only determination done was to ensure those rates were reasonable and appropriate.   The CUA requirement for this operation regarding rates stated "All rates charged to the public by the permittee for commercial services authorized by this CUA shall be reasonable and appropriate for the type and quality of services required or authorized under the CUA.  All rates must be approved by the National Park Service in advance."    
39.	What is the wheel chair rental charge or how will it be established?Please refer to the Draft Contract, Section 3(e) Rates.
40.	Can we charge by fractional hours for bicycle rentals? i.e. 15 minute increments.The successful Concessioner may propose rates that are broken into fractional hours, and the Service will review and may approve them if it finds that it is common among the comparable businesses chosen to determine rates. 
41.	Does NPS have initial guidance estimates on the useful life of the bicycle fleet?The Offeror must make its own determination regarding this, based on its own business experience and model.  
42.	Does NPS have guidance of the number of shuttles needed to efficiently service the shuttle operation?The Offeror must make its own determination regarding this, based on its own business experience and model.  
43.	Will NPS provide or will they by the time of the contract, provide additional signage on the Bike trails/Greenway trail. This signage would be giving information to the bike rental guests, i.e., distance between points (1.5 miles to G.C. Village, 2.6 miles to Hermits Rest, going east to Yaki Point).The Service is currently developing plans to improve signage on Greenway trails.  Timing for installation of new signs depends on funding.  At this time, the Service does not know if such signage will be in place at the start of the contract.
44.	Are the full costs of potential, future renovations to any buildings, pathways, staircases, or other physical building elements associated with the bicycle rental facility to comply with the American's with Disabilities Act (or future revisions of that Act) the responsibility of the National Park Service?The NPS believes the facility and exterior pathways currently comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Future revisions of the Act would be dealt with on an as-needed basis.  
45.	Is there any knowledge of a current or historical soil contamination from previous vendor on the site of the bike rental facility?The Service is not aware of any current or historical soil contamination in the project area.  
46.	Do exceptions to categorical exclusions under current NPS service policy apply for this area?NEPA and 106 compliance for this activity, and its associated facility, were approved under the Park's 2008 Transportation Plan Environmental Assessment.    
47.	What environmental attributes are being incorporated into the building of the bike rental facility as prescribed by NPS policies and guiding documents?The facility will include a number of environmentally preferable features, including a tankless water heater, low-e glass, use of low VOC paints and finishes, and recycling of construction waste.  See the building specification documents (Referenced in #48) for more information.  Please note that these documents are working drafts, not as-built.  
48.	What are the specifications for construction elements of the building?The construction documents include a 175 page set of standard construction specifications, in addition to the construction drawings. Those specifications are available at the NPS Commercial Services website.  A link to that can be found at:  http://www.nps.gov/commercialservices/grca034-12.htm
Please note:  these are working drafts, not as-built.  
49.	Does Section I, Part 1 of Exhibit E permit the Concessioner to allow a licensed contractor to perform activities approved under the authorized Integrated Pest Management plan?The Concessioner must adhere to the terms and conditions of the Draft Contract and all Exhibits regarding Integrated Pest Management.  This may include the Concessioner using the services of a licensed contractor to perform IPM activities, as approved by the Service.  
50.	What conditions or allowances will be made and are permissible for additional housing needs?The two trailer sites as described in the Draft Concession Contract are the only housing assigned to the Concessioner.  Additional housing needs must be met outside of the Park.  
51.	Is there an incident/accident three-year history report from current bike operations? No. The Service does not have these records, and the requirement to provide them was not a part of the previous operator's permit requirements.

For Production, Maintenance, and Sustainment Support for Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Systems

<SOLNBR>N0002412R6303
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>122311
<ARCHDATE>01072012

<DESC>THIS RFI CHANGES FROM: 


Description
This is an RFI for planning purposes only, as part of a market survey led by PMS-408, EOD/CREW Program Office, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).  This is not a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Background
The Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) initiative has met urgent and compelling operational requirements to counter the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in order to reduce combat fatalities during Operation New Dawn (OND) (formerly Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  This has resulted in a number of urgent procurements over the past several years.
  

PMS 408, EOD/CREW provides the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED). The current CREW Systems include three distinct variants that utilize common hardware, software, and firmware components.  These variants consist of: dismounted systems (man-portable), mounted systems (ground and waterborne), and fixed site systems (semi-permanent geographical area and fixed).   The current CREW systems are fielded in support of OND and OEF.  

PMS-408 EOD/CREW is searching for companies that have demonstrated past performance in the engineering, production, maintenance, and support of electro-mechanical systems that will support the current PMS 408 portfolio of CREW systems.
  The portfolio of CREW systems includes, but is not limited to, the AN/PLQ-9(V)1, AN/PLT-2, AN/PLT-5, CVRJ(V1), CVRJ(V2), Mini-Titan, and Universal Test Set. Qualified respondents should have the ability to provide engineering service support, depot maintenance support, spare parts and consumables, engineering change proposals, technology insertion and refresh, obsolescence management support, logistics management information, and demilitarization and disposal of the CREW portfolio of systems.  Qualified respondents should be able to fabricate electro-mechanical systems when provided a technical data package (TDP), applicable software/firmware, and an operational system and have the ability and production capacity to rapidly ramp up a production line.

The support for the CREW portfolio of systems is scoped by the integrated product support (IPS) elements, which provide a structured and integrated framework for managing product support.
 The IPS elements include product support management; design interface; sustaining engineering; supply support; maintenance planning and management; Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&T); technical data; support equipment; training and training support; manpower/personnel; facilities and infrastructure; and computer resources.  Qualified respondents should address sustainment as relevant using the Product Support Element and corresponding activities (as appropriate for the Operations and Sustainment (O&S) phase) as detailed in the Department of Defense (DoD) Product Support Managerâ€™s (PSM) Guidebook dated April of 2011.  Qualified respondents should concentrate on Sustainment Maturity Levels (SML) 9 through 12, with emphasis on SMLs 11 and 12, and provide sustainment metrics.

Requested Information
Respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
a) Industryâ€™s recommendation regarding how Industry can help the Government support currently fielded CREW systems; 
b) Engineering and technical expertise with hardware, firmware, and software;
c) Demonstrated Past Performance in engineering and manufacturing of electro-mechanical and/or CREW systems;
d) The ability to contract for the purchase of parts and materials and perform quality checks on the parts and materials procured;
e) The ability to produce technical documentation and data;
f) Manufacturing capability to include:  manufacturing/assembly location(s), available floor space, production capacity/throughput, and equipment/tooling;
g) Relevant certifications (e.g., ISO 9000);
h) Item Unique Identification (IUID) capabilities/experience;
i) The ability to provide Engineering Service Support and Supply Support;
j) The ability to conduct Maintenance Planning and Management;
k) Logistics Management Information capabilities and experience;
l) Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&T);
m) Field Service Representative Support (CONUS and OCONUS);
n) The ability to perform Depot Maintenance and available Manpower/Personnel, Facilities, and Infrastructure
o) Training and Training Support capabilities and experience;
p) Computer Resources planning and support;
q) Title X Obligations;
r) System Demilitarization and Disposal

Response Format
Interested firms who believe they are capable of providing engineering, production, maintenance, and support of CREW systems are invited to indicate their interest by providing; (a) company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; and (b) business size and unique qualifiers (e.g., large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.)

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 â€“ compatible format.
  RFI responses are limited to fifteen (15) pages, including cover and administrative pages, and shall be delivered using 10 point font or larger.

Response Deadline and Submissions

<DESC>Project Title: Invitation for Bids - Construct New Dormitory<br /><br />Location: Thule Air Base, Greenland <br /><br />Note: This solicitation and award is restricted, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c )(4) International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms. <br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a solicitation package seeking to award a firm-fixed price contract for the construction of a new, 4,550 SM, 3-story dormitory facility. This will be a competitive, Invitation for Bids, bid opening. The facility will be built with arctic foundations in the permafrost, it will be steel frame, insulated panel exterior and pitched metal roof. The work includes site improvements, all utilities and communications. The contractor will furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to construct the facility. General Conditions at Thule Air Base: The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The region is glaciated and the existing soil is generally permafrost, which exists from 1 to 6 feet below the surface and to a measured depth of 1,600 feet. Average winter temperature is 20-30 degrees F below zero while average summer temperature is 40-50 degrees F above zero. One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB, approximately 1 July. There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB, one in July &amp; one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis. The project magnitude is over $20 million. The performance period shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). <br />Anticipate the plans and specifications to be posted electronically on or about 6 December 2011 via the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fbo.gov, with bids due on or about 5 January 2012.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Veterans Affairs James J. Peters Medical Center, Network Contracting Acquisitions (VISN3) intends to enter into sole source procurement Pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.302-1, with San Simeon by the Sound Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, Inc.  San Simeon is located at 61700 Rte 48 at Greenport, NY  11944-2206.  The period of performance will be for Fiscal Year 2012.  Services will be performed for James J. Peters Medical Center (Northport, New York).  VAMC Northport covers a large catchment area, which includes both Nassau and Suffolk counties, which stretches from the eastern edge of NYC to Montauk Point, which is approximately 100 miles long. San Simeon nursing facility is more than 40 miles from the nearest other contract nursing home, and will provide service to veterans on the eastern end of Long Island who were previously not served well by the CNH program. In addition, this new contract facility will support the new VAMC Northport CBOC in Riverhead and the Home Based Primary Care team, which will work with frail elderly homebound veterans with caregivers who may eventually need nursing home placement. The families of veterans placed in nursing facilities have consistently requested facilities as close as possible to their place of residence. The CNH program has tried as much as possible to meet these requests, as it encourages family visits, which enhances quality of life for veterans placed in nursing facilities. The intent is for nursing home services to be provided at the VA James J. Peters Medical Center in Northport, New York.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated service mentioned, please provided the supporting documents demonstrating their equipment/ capability; and specifications no later than December 19, 2011 @ 9:00am. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist; Michelle Sylva-Brown at Michelle.Sylva-Brown@va.gov. No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted. This procurement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 13, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
