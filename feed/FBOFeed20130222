The rotary couplers are used in FAA radar systems and are critical to Air Traffic Control in maintaining safety in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The rotary coupler is a single point of failure for every radar system.  In the event of coupler failure, there are no back-up systems in place.  Therefore the quality and projected life cycle of the rotary couplers is vital to the continued support of the NAS.  

The requirement will be for one base year period with four one-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  It is anticipated that multiple contracts may be awarded to meet this requirement.

First article testing will be required for repair of each rotary coupler repaired by other than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  First article test procedures will be set forth in the solicitation.

Results of repair/overhaul shall meet the standards specified in the FAA's Certificates of Compliance and Measurement Set documents for each rotary coupler. (See attachments to market survey.)  

Cobham Defense Electronic Systems, Kevlin Division is the OEM for the rotary couplers and holds the proprietary rights to the technical documentation.  Therefore, the FAA does not have any specifications or drawings available for release.    

The intent of this announcement is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to repair/overhaul the Cobham rotary couplers an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT: 

Qualified vendors are invited to submit documentation evidencing the possession of the following capabilities:

1. Demonstration of experience involving manufacture, repair, and testing of rotary couplers of equal complexity or greater, including repair and testing of rotary couplers produced by other manufacturers.
2. Demonstration of possession of the proper National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibrated test equipment to verify compliance to the FAA's Certificates of Compliance and Measurement Set documents for each rotary coupler
3. Demonstration of the ability to manufacture or locate and obtain parts for repair
4. Demonstration of the capacity to handle the projected workload and return each unit to the FAA within 180 days after the receipt of an order
5. Demonstration of the capability to warranty each repaired rotary coupler for a period of five (5) years after installation in a radar site.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSE TO MARKET SURVEY:
In order to be considered responsive, organizations expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:
a. Capability Statement (as defined above)
b. Completed Business Declaration Form

Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.

Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to: Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey: Rotary Coupler Repair, to arrive by 2:00 p.m. CST, March 8, 2013.  

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) - Sensor Science Division, intends to negotiate with ATK Space Systems Inc.; Logan, UT, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 3304(a)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to purchase a lock-in amplifier.
<p>The NIST Sensor Science Division maintains a transfer standard cryogenic vacuum infrared radiometer known as the MDXR which is calibrated at NIST and then shipped to user facilities to transfer the low-background infrared irradiance scale to customer space simulation chambers. These chambers are manufactured by the ATK Corporation. In particular, several ATK model LSPS 16a infrared test chambers are used by a major NIST customer (Raytheon Missile Systems Company), who has requested that NIST provide a method for attaching the MDXR to these chambers that is compatible with the wheeled cart/rail configuration that ATK has provided to them for attaching their own equipment to the chamber. In order to meet this requirement, NIST has a conceptual design for a cart that can hold the MDXR during shipping to the customer site, allow it to roll onto their laboratory floor, and provide a separable "truck" which will enable the MDXR to roll onto the ATK rail system and mate with an LSPS 16a chamber. NIST does not have access to the proprietary design of the ATK rail system, but we can provide a list of functional specifications for the Chamber Cart based on the known dimensions and weight of the MDXR. Market research has shown that ATK Space Systems Inc. is the only company that can provide an MDXR ATK LSPS 16a chamber cart that meets the requirements.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334511- Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 750 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to ATK Space Systems Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than March 8, 2013 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC>The objective is to provide a modernized bathroom that will include new features such as plumbing fixtures (toilet, and vanity), wall and floor tiles, paint, toilet accessories & light fixtures.  The intent is to verify and reuse existing infrastructure such as the wall/ceiling board, electrical wiring, plumbing and HVAC systems.  

Construction phasing and hours are to be coordinated with the Construction Manager (CM) to minimize disruption to residents.  Careful consideration is needed when turning off systems such as water and power.

The intent is to demolish and prepare the existing bathrooms for the new finishes and fixtures while returning the bathrooms to full function.  This process will include, but not limited to, the removal of the toilet, sink, light fixtures, wall & floor tiles.
 The existing bathtub is to remain.  The substrate walls are to be inspected for integrity and ability to support the new finishes.  Water damage is to be identified if present. Plumbing and electrical connections are to be inspected.  Any existing deficiencies should be identified in order to renovate the bathrooms to full working order.

Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division plans to enter into an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a maximum six month performance with Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC), 10260 Campus Point, San Diego, CA 92121.
  It is anticipated that Fixed Price Level of Effort (FPLOE) task orders will be issued as required for a continuation of training and training support of weapons and inspection and repair of weapons.   Performance based tasking will provide a wide range of technical support for the training of U.S. Navy Special Warfare/Special Operating Forces (SOF) and other DOD agencies. This will include report generation, logistic documentation, joint training plan update, training curriculum/documentation, development of presentation material. Tasking will require a Special Operations Forces Fielding and Training Team (SOF FTT) for coordinating and executing the fielding and New Equipment Training (NET) of SOF procured equipment, as well as refresher training and new equipment modifications on a continuous basis to maintain SOF firepower on the cutting edge of technology.
 The SOF FTT will also provide support for new logistics training, inspections, and other logistics actions required to fully install new systems in combat units, to inspect old systems, and to ensure turn-in of obsolete, worn, or damaged systems. The FTT tasking will be conducted worldwide and will require travel on a continuous basis. 

This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is to prevent an unacceptable lapse in the technical support of critical weapon systems.  These Small Arms Weapon system requirements play a central role in the Navys combat mission.
  Any interruption in deliveries and support of these critical projects would result in reduced warfighter effectiveness due to loss of full mission capability.  SAIC is the only vendor capable of continuing to provide the Navy with uninterrupted training and technical support of Small Arms Weapon systems.    

A formal solicitation will not be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Direct questions to Mr.
 Terrell Turner by e-mail terrell.turner1@navy.mil (preferred) or by phone 812-854-2780.  Please reference the last four digits of the solicitation number when responding to this notice.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center San Diego intends to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price IDIQ services contract on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, with Rady Childrens Hospital-San Diego (RCHSD); 3020 Childrens Way, San Diego, CA 92123; for laboratory diagnostic testing services, based on their laboratory being able to perform all required tests as well as having all the equipment necessary and maintaining the technical staff to use it so that the facility can receive and process specimens quickly.  The contracts required turnaround time is same day for most tests.  As such, only a properly staffed laboratory located in proximity of Navy Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) can provide immediate test results.
  RCHSD has the required knowledge, equipment, expertise, and experience to complete these laboratory diagnostic testing services in the required time.  Place of performance is the contractors site.

In order to properly diagnose patients with contagious diseases, NMCSD requires expedited laboratory testing using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology.  The tests required are Enterovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 and 2, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, PTH Colorimetric, SSII, PTH Gross Level 1, PTH courier x 2, and Electron Microscopy for kidney biopsies.

The applicable NAICS code is 621511.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 No formal solicitation package is available. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in responding to this notice; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements and past performance data no later than 08:00am Pacific Standard Time on 11 March 2013. All interested parties must demonstrate their appropriate expertise and experience in expedited laboratory diagnostic testing services using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology as well as their proximity to NMCSD.  All documents shall be submitted to Alan M. Gonzales, Contract Specialist, via email at alan.gonzales@navy.mil.  Anything submitted by phone or fax will not be considered.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>The contract is for the construction of the Napa River Salt Marsh Restoration Project to restore Ponds 6, 6A, 7 and 7A to managed and tidal wetlands.</p>
<p>Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines 52.219-14, the concern will perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Description of work for pre-solicitation notice:</p>
<p>Ponds 6, 6A, 7, 7A, and 8 are located west of the Napa River, within the slough network north of San Pablo Bay. The ponds vary in acreage with a total of approximately 3,000 acres, not including adjacent sloughs. Pond 7 was used as the bittern pond, a repository of concentrated soluble salts other than sodium chloride (primarily chloride, magnesium, sulfate, potassium, and bromide ions and water) remaining after sodium chloride is harvested.</p>
<p>The construction of the Napa River Salt Marsh Restoration Project would restore Ponds 6, 6A, 7, 7A, and 8 to managed ponds. During construction, special equipment would be required to minimize environmental damage to the wetlands and enable work in areas with extremely soft substrates. Ponds 6 and 6A can only be accessed by water, and the adjacent sloughs are shallow. The construction would require removing high salinity brines from Pond 7, and improving water circulation and the ability to manage water levels within the ponds. Meeting these objectives would require the following:<br />&bull; Water control structures and gates involving construction of culverts through pond embankments, and installation of pipes gates (slide gate, flap gate, combination gate)<br />&bull; Maintenance bridges and walkways to provide access for operation of pipe gates<br />&bull; Solar powered fish screen at the Napa Slough intake into Pond 7A<br />&bull; Earthen embankment improvements consisting of raising embankment crests, improving embankment slopes, and riprap slope protection<br />&bull; Inlet and outlet water control structures for Ponds 6/6A<br />&bull; Inlet and outlet water control structures for Ponds 7/7A to increase water discharge to the mixing chamber <br />&bull; An outlet water control structure for the Pond 8 canal to improve flow into the mixing chamber<br />&bull; Modifying the Pond 7/7A "donut" (small pond used as a water transfer structure during the salt production period) to install an air bubbler system and control instrumentation to mix bittern from Pond 7 with ambient water from Ponds 7A and 8 at the approved ratio for discharge to Napa Slough<br />&bull; Integrating a recycled water pipeline into the mixing chamber control/operating system (the recycled water pipeline will be installed by others<br />&bull; Demonstrating the effectiveness of the mixing chamber following completion of physical construction for a minimum period of 3 months, and implementing optional modifications as directed <br />&bull; Security and vandalism control<br />&bull; Internal and perimeter embankment improvements at Ponds 7, 7A, and 8<br />&bull; On-going biological periodic water quality monitoring of work activities through a qualified subcontractor.<br />&bull; Coordination of access to the Pond 7/7A work area to allow use of the wildlife area by hunters and other recreationists, and detailed schedule coordination with the recycled water pipeline installation (the recycled water pipeline installation will occur in the same levee road required for access to the project area)</p>
<p>Based on prior work in the project area on similar types of activities, the equipment necessary for the construction of Ponds 6 - 8 is shown below. The type of equipment is shown by generalized work units with a brief description of the activities included under each heading, followed by a list of equipment that would be used in completion of the stated activities. Note that only the types of equipment likely to be used are provided; the quantity of equipment is not estimated since this would vary greatly depending upon construction sequence and schedule. This equipment is representative, and other equivalent equipment may be used. The contractor must have the capability to mobilize equipment to the Pond 6/6A embankment from the water (no land access), and be aware that water depths in the vicinity of Ponds 6/6A are typically quite shallow. Some work will occur in areas with extremely soft substrates.</p>

<CONTACT>David Bianculli, Program Manager, Email AFLCMC.HBSIK.WORKFLOW@HANSCOM.AF.MIL
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. This RFI is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This RFI's sole purpose is to conduct market research for a system capable of providing a Mark XIIA Mode 5 and Mode S, henceforth referred to as Mode 5/S, capability for an Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) Radar and Mark XII (Mode 4) IFF Interrogator system used as part of an Airborne Mission System (AMS). Submission of any data in response to this RFI is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY by the respondent and/or his representative, and SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A FEE to the government. Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals.
<p>Description of Need: Mode 4 equipment will need to be replaced with Mode 5/S equipment. There is an operational need to develop an interrogator that can operate with the Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) Radar and IFF antenna to provide Mode 5/S interrogation capability. <br />Current Situation: Future operators of an AMS will need the capability to interrogate Mode 5/S. Integration of Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) interrogator systems may not be suitable due to the design of the ESA Radar and IFF antenna. The International AWACS Branch (HBSI) of the Battle Management Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base is managing a technical program to develop solution sets for the above stated operational need. HBSI seeks a commercial or developmental Mark XIIA Mode 5/S System Interrogator that is compatible with the ESA Radar and IFF antenna (upgrade or replacement) and with the following minimum desired technical capabilities:</p>
<p>a. A method for standoff detection-capable of operating at slant range of 250+ nm.</p>
<p>b. Capable of 360 Degree coverage with the existing ESA antenna.</p>
<p>c. Capable of operating aboard an airborne platform in environmental conditions facilitating worldwide deployments and for use at operating altitudes exceeding 41,000' Mean Sea Level (MSL).</p>
<p>d. Backward compatible with existing Mode 4 capable AMS.</p>
<p>e. Capable of Mode 5 level 1 and Level 2 (at least Growth ready) and Mode S enhanced surveillance (EHS) interrogation and processing.</p>
<p>f. Interrogator should possess Mode 5 "lethal interrogation" capability.</p>
<p>g. Box level DoD Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, Identification Friend or Foe, Mark XII/Mark XIIA, Systems (AIMS) certification is required (if not, the interrogator set must be able to achieve DoD AIMS certification prior to installation and testing). <br />h.

<DESC>The Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Specialized Contracting Branch is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested sources to provide Special Departure Procedures support for the Air Mobility Command. Part of the market research is to publish on FedBizOpps a Sources Sought Synopsis seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services, as described herein, as well as on terms and conditions relevant to this potential procurement. The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force (AF) to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to this synopsis are cautioned that this synopsis is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a RFP. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information provided in response to this synopsis.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The AF will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this synopsis. Responses to the synopsis will not be returned. Not responding to this SYNOPSIS does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code to be used for this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $25.5M. This requirement is a potential follow-on to Contract #FA8101-10-M-0163, currently being performed by Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. The Government is contemplating use of an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with firm-fixed-price delivery orders. However, as no acquisition plan has been approved, the procurement strategy is subject to change. Additionally, there is currently no timeframe for potential RFP release. Approximate start date, assuming a contract is issued, would be 15 Sep 2013.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />1. Company Information: Name, address, telephone number, point of contact names, e-mail addresses, CAGE code, and small business status (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.).</p>

Past performance information that is related to the tasks in the Draft PWS is requested if available.</p>
<p>4. Please indicate for which aircraft in PWS paragraph 1.4.1 your company has an existing Standard Computerized Aircraft Performance (SCAP) module.

Revegetation of the disturbed sites will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.
<p>A contractor will be required to provide a qualified stream restoration specialist to represent them and supervise during the following construction activities: 1) equipment operation required for site access (setting temporary bridges at stream crossings), 2) equipment operation within the active channel or on stream banks, 3) floodplain construction quality control (Government estimates 2 days per week) and 4) sediment pond spillway construction. The representative shall possess a Bachelor's degree in fish biology, hydrology, geomorphology, engineering or a related field, at a minimum, though a Master's degree is preferred. In addition, the representative shall possess a minimum of 10 years related experience and a minimum of 3-5 years of experience performing/overseeing similar stream restoration projects.</p>
<p>The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce Clearwater National Forests, Idaho County, Idaho. To reach the project site, travel approximately 40 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction with Newsome Creek Road (Forest Service Road 1858). Proceed up Newsome Creek Road, past the old Newsome Townsite, approximately 7 miles to a gated access road that takes off sharply uphill and to the right. This road can be identified by the large boulders that have been placed by the gate. A similar road takes off just prior to this access road but no boulders are present. Motorized access is prohibited. The project site is located approximately 1 &frac12; miles from the gate. A formal pre-bid tour is not planned at this time. <br /><br />The estimated price range for the project is between $500,000-$1,000,000. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued in late March 2013 with implementation planned for the Summer/Fall of 2013. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. This project constitutes Phase III of a multi-phase project. Phases I and II, located upstream from the current project area, were completed in 2011 and 2012.</p>

<p>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission<br />Division of Contracts <br />Attn: Jeffrey R. Mitchell; M/S: TWB-01-B10M<br />11555 Rockville Pike<br />Rockville, MD 20852</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541690. The anticipated period of performance will be 60 months.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong><br />The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) is responsible for contributing to the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools, and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders. RES supports the development, enhancement, and maintenance of databases - of initiating events, fire events, systems and component reliability, and plant performance - used in agency risk applications such as Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) analysis, Standardized Plant Analysis Risk (SPAR) models and Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) analysis. RES activities also contribute to identifying the issues that need to be resolved to ensure safe operation for up to 80 years, conducting research to resolve these and potential new issues, and developing guidance to nuclear power plants in programs to manage the aging of systems, structures, and components important to safety.</p>
<p>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has been providing technical assistance to the Division of Risk Analysis (DRA) in the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) in the areas of data collection and reliability and risk calculation. These efforts were originally conducted primarily under the "Common-Cause Failure (CCF) Methods and Risk Databases" and "Integrated Data Coding and Analysis (IDCA) Methods" projects. The information captured under both projects came from several sources including Licensee Event Reports (LERs), Monthly Operating Reports (MORs), and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations' (INPO's) Equipment Performance Information and Exchange (EPIX) system. Similarly, under the sponsorship of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was capturing LER data in the Sequence Coding and Search System (SCSS). To gather the information necessary to complete the studies conducted under each job code required duplication of many tasks, such as reading the same event report multiple times to gather the common and unique information associated with each study. This duplication of effort led to the decision by RES that the technical assistance efforts conducted by INL and ORNL for RES needed to be conducted in a more efficient and integrated manner.</p>
<p>In fiscal year (FY) 2001, under the IDCA Methods project, INL began the development of the integrated coding system to capture the information necessary to support the RES uses with minimal duplication of effort. Implementation of this system began in FY 2002 and was completed in FY 2004. Under that project, INL developed a coding manual with guidance for reviewing and coding LERs, a quality assurance (QA) program that ensured data were captured completely and accurately, and an Integrated Data Collection and Coding System (IDCCS) user's guide.</p>
<p>In FY 2003, a new project, "Reactor Operating Experience Data for Risk Applications," was established to use the IDCCS and the documentation developed under the IDCA Methods project to capture, code, quality assure, and maintain all the data and associated software necessary to support various NRC activities. This project replaced the similar data collection and coding efforts previously performed at INL under the CCF Methods and IDCA Methods projects and at ORNL in the SCSS. This data collection and coding effort continued throughout FY 2004, FY 2005, and FY 2006. During this time period, various software applications were developed to support this effort.</p>
<p>In FY 2007, INL began an effort to restructure the IDCCS for more efficient and consistent coding, to meet the changing directions of data needed for the Industry Trends Program (ITP) Support project, and to eventually provide Web-based access to the IDCCS for NRC staff.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, NRC directed INL to expand the existing operating experience database(s) to include inspection reports so that staff may more effectively search through the data in NRC commercial nuclear power plant (reactor) inspection reports. (These reports contain valuable information that can be used to study issues related to operating experience and support other agency efforts related to licensee performance and NRC oversight.)</p>
<p>As part of the NRC's continuing effort to consolidate and enhance operational experience data base activities and to better support the needs of the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program by improving the ASP data base, screening for candidate ASP events has been incorporated into this project. This allows for improved program efficiency, facilitates quality control of the operational experience database(s), and contributes to ease of loading relevant items into the database(s).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought</span></strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in reviewing LERs, MORs, plant inspection reports, EPIX data, and candidate ASP events and in <br />collecting, coding (classifying), assuring quality of, and maintaining all reactor operating experience data necessary to support the Industry Trends Program, SPAR models and various other risk-associated NRC/RES studies requiring reactor operating experience data. There will be no analysis or evaluation of data.</p>
<p>This project requires a mixture of expertise in nuclear plant operations, probabilistic risk assessment, reliability, and statistics - i.e., individuals assigned to this project will need to have a combination of knowledge and experience in both nuclear power systems and PRA applications for nuclear power plants. Additionally, staff assigned to work on this project shall have knowledge and experience in using SQL (Software Query Language) Server for database applications and experience in using SQL Server for developing data files for SAS (Statistical Analysis System) applications - in particular, essentials of SAS programming and SAS Enterprise Guide. Collectively, staff assigned to work on this project shall be knowledgeable and highly skilled in their own (individual) field(s) of expertise; they shall have demonstrated skills in computation and data compilation, programming and coding, probabilistic risk assessment, systems analysis, communication and working with others - more specifically, experience in or knowledge of: nuclear power plant (NPP) system design and operation; NPP response to various transient and accident initiators, including recovery measures which might be pursued to mitigate the impact of the specific initiator; experience with screening and review of operational experience data from LERs, NRC Inspection Reports, and INPO's EPIX component failure records; and NRC regulations and the nuclear industry's reporting criteria," 10 CFR 50.73 "Licensee Event Report system," and NUREG-1022 Rev. 1 " Licensee Event Report System." A minimum of 5 years practical experience in their field of expertise is required, along with a formal education at the university level equivalent to receiving a bachelor=s degree.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandatory Qualifying Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>The contractors should be technical experts in their field, with extensive nuclear research experience. Membership in professional associations and active participation at relevant professional meetings such as PSAM (Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management) conferences is desirable. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge and corporate and individual experience and expertise in their technical area(s) in order to identify and resolve issues.

Background/Requirements

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Information Technology (IT) has identified a need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as enterprise level services to support the VA IT systems.  IAM encapsulates people, processes and products to identify and manage the data used in an information system to authenticate users and grant or deny access rights to data and system resources.  One of the goals of IAM is to support a common mechanism for allowing beneficiaries, employees and other interested parties (e.g. providers) to transact business digitally with VA.  This will be accomplished through the implementation of a digital signature solution in which a signing device will be utilized.

This proposed action is for an upgrade to an existing Veeco/ Bruker Nano, Inc. MultiMode V Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516. Size standard is 500 employees. <br />The proposed source is Bruker Nano, Inc., 3400 E. Britannia Drive STE 150 Tucson, AZ 85706-5003. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />To comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15): AFRL/RAXP requires the modification of an upgrade which includes a new V8 compatible computer, DSP, frame grabber, MultiMode base electronics upgrade, a new 37 pin adapter (Model 37PA), and a 30-inch LCD monitor. Other commercially available scanning probe microscope components are not compatible with the hardware and software of the existing NanoScope V Control Station and do not provide the enhanced capabilities (ScanAsyst, Peak Force Tapping, and Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping) only provided by the NanoScope V8 Upgrade. Purchasing competing technology to fulfill the government's requirements would result in additional expenditures totaling an estimated $xxxx. The estimate for this contemplated action is $xxxx therefore the cost differential for this example is $xxxx. This cost cannot be recovered through competition. The only known source to meet the government's requirements is Bruker Nano.<br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 21 May 1998. You may contact SAM at its website: https://www.sam.gov.<br />

IMPORTANT NOTE: If selected for negotiations on either the Services or Advisory contracts; the prime firm and all sub-consultants cannot be involved in the award not selected for. (I.E. if selected for services the sub-consultants and the prime itself cannot be involved in any aspect of the Advisory contracts, it creates a conflict of interest for the Government and the firms). Please annotate the interest in your SF330 if submitting for both acquisitions in order of interest. EXAMPLE: 1 Services, 2 Advisory - meaning if selected for both your first priority for award is Services. If selected for your priority you will not be considered for the alternate.

<p>3. Four indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with one base year and four option years. The amount of each contract shall not exceed $50,000,000.00. Work on each individual task order will be negotiated as firm-fixed-price task orders. The technical team and Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, and equitable distribution of work among the contractors.</p>

IMPORTANT NOTE: If selected for negotiations on either the Services or Advisory contracts; the prime firm and all sub-consultants cannot be involved in the award not selected for. (I.E. if selected for services the sub-consultants and the prime itself cannot be involved in any aspect of the Advisory contracts, it creates a conflict of interest for the Government and the firms). Please annotate the interest in your SF330 if submitting for both acquisitions in order of interest. EXAMPLE: 1 Services, 2 Advisory - meaning if selected for both your first priority for award is Services. If selected for your priority you will not be considered for the alternate. Conversely: 1 Advisory, 2 Services - meaning if selected for both your priority is Advisory and you will be excluded from the Services award.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.  The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground, Tenant Contracting Division, 6001 Combat Drive, Aberdeen Proving Ground MD 21005 has a requirement to procure MSD Custom Bio Kits, in support of the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) Environmental Monitoring Laboratory (EML), located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  <br> CLIN 0001: Qty: 200 - MSD Bio Kit B, Anthracis, Part Number R99XX-1 <br> CLIN 0002: Qty: 200 - MSD Bio Kit Neurotoxin A, Part Number R99XX-1 <br> CLIN 0003: Qty: 200 - MSD Bio Kit F.

ECBC requires reagents to detect biowarfare agents by electrochemiluminescence.  An MSD ECL instrument, and assays specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the instrument, have been validated and is approved for use.  The test kits required, utilized MSD's proprietary multiplexed electrochemiluminescence technology which fulfills the sensitivity, specificity and throughput capacity needed and there are no other suppliers that provide products or services that incorporate this technology.  Not obtaining this requirement for MSD assays and reagents on time will result in ECC's mission failure by failing to provide validated laboratory capabilities.  In addition using an untested system for sample analysis is unacceptable under the ISO 17025 quality guidelines and would put ECBC at risk of losing its testing accreditation which would thus prevent ECBC from performing operations.  The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the Business Size Standard is 500. <br> All response received within 5 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 10:00 AM EST, February 27, 2013.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br> For questions concerning this Notice of Intent, contact Ms. Maureen Cameron, maureen.v.cameron.civ@mail.mil.  Posting date of this requirement is February 22, 2013.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED. <br>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-01-364-9489<br />Name:		Tabs, Multicolor, Numerical, 1-5<br />Description:	Assorted Colors, 8-1/2" x 11", Tabs are numerical, from 1 to 5. No tab typing or tab inserting. UOI is SE. SE = 5 tabs.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1120<br />Name:		Tabs, Multicolor, Numerical, 1-12<br />Description:	Assorted Colors, 8-1/2" x 11", Tabs are numerical, from 1 to 12. No tab typing or tab inserting. UOI is SE. SE = 12 tabs.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-01-407-2248<br />Name:		Tabs, Legal, Clear, Numerical, 26-50<br />Description:	Index Divider, 26-50, w/Table of Content, 11"x8-1/2", made of heavy-duty white stock with boldly printed black characters. Offered in white. UOI is SE. SE = 26 sheets.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-01-407-2250<br />Name:		Tabs, Legal, Clear, Numerical, 1-25<br />Description:	Index Divider, 1-25, w/Table of Content, 11"x8-1/2", made of heavy-duty white stock with boldly printed black characters. Offered in white. UOI is SE. SE = 26 sheets.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-01-364-9489<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	CRD60518; SJPST64105; AVE11131; SPR 21900</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1120<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	CRD61218; AVE11141; AVE11673; SJPST64112; KLF41012;&nbsp;SPR 21903</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-01-407-2248<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	KLF91902; KLF81172; AVE01702</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-01-407-2250<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	KLF81170; AVE01701</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 8, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>Business Opportunity-Grand Island National Recreation Area-<br />Water Transportation Services
<p>The Hiawatha National Forest is soliciting all qualified applicants who have or can acquire all necessary facilities and services to provide water ferrying services for the Grand Island National Recreation Area. Services shall include, but not be limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, equipment, supplies, materials, and incidental transportation and related facilities and services for the public's (and Government's) use in gaining access to and from the USDA, Forest Service's Grand Island National Recreation Area. The primary services for which proposals are being sought are:</p>
<p>1. Providing passenger ferrying services from the mainland near Munising, Michigan to Williams Landing on GINRA. A government owned 30 passenger aluminum pontoon boat is available for use by the applicant.</p>
<p>2. Collecting recreation use fees from people accessing Grand Island via passenger ferry, including accounting and reporting of fees. (Recreation use fees are in addition to ferry service fees).</p>
<p>3. Providing vehicular transport services (including passenger vehicles, heavy construction equipment, and utility vehicles) to and from GINRA. A government owned 130 gross tons tug and barge is available for use by the applicant.</p>
<p>This permit will offer exclusive rights to the permit holder to provide passenger ferrying services and vehicle ferrying services to Grand Island National Recreation Area. No other permits will be issued.</p>
<p>Interested parties must provide offers of both passenger ferrying services AND vehicle ferrying services. Offers not including both types of service will be considered non-responsive and will be rejected. <br />Applicants are responsible for producing their own business plans and for their own financial predictions in responding to this prospectus.</p>
<p>The current permit for this concession expired on December 31, 2012. Over the past three years, this concession has generated the following gross revenues:</p>
<p>Year Gross Revenue</p>
<p>2010 $96,289<br />2011 $101,306<br />2012 $117,432</p>
<p><br />The following is a description of the minimum services to be provided:</p>
<p><br />Passenger Ferry Service</p>
<p>Ferrying services shall provide ferrying of passengers (including those with disabilities) personal equipment, pets, and bicycles to and from Grand Island National Recreation Area. At a minimum, services shall be offered between the periods from the Friday of Memorial Day weekend through October 9. Services shall also be provided seven days a week as follows:</p>
<p>--May, June and after Labor Day: Three times daily at a minimum<br />--July and August: Four times daily at a minimum</p>
<p>The trips must be evenly spaced through the day between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm.</p>
<p>Ferry Vessel: The ferrying vessel must meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; a minimum of 20 feet in length <br />&bull; licensed to carry a minimum of six passengers<br />&bull; approved by U.S. Coast Guard or Michigan Department of Natural Resources <br />&bull; licensed (depending on jurisdiction) and <br />&bull; must operate under existing regulations and law <br />&bull; must be piloted by individuals licensed and insured to do so.</p>
<p>During July and August the Provider will utilize the Forest Service provided Kitchi-Miniss or equivalent capacity vessel. The rationale for requiring a 30-passenger-capacity vessel is to reduce the waiting time for the passengers arriving or departing the island. The greatest need for the larger capacity vessel has traditionally been the 3:30 departure from the island. The Kitchi- Miniss or equivalent vessel must be inspected and licensed by the U.S. Coast Guard at the Provider's expense and also insured by the Provider.</p>
<p>Provider will coordinate transportation services for up to 800 people connected with the annual Grand Island Marathon and Half Marathon held in late July. In the past, the Permittee has contracted with a local boat company. In addition, the Provider will be required to work collaboratively with the Permittee authorized by the Forest Service to provide an interpretive bus tour on the island and rental cabins available to the public.<br /><br />The Provider will collect and show accounting of use fees from people accessing Grand Island via passenger ferry and deposit the fees collected with the Forest Service.</p>
<p>The Provider will maintain, on a daily basis, the Grand Island Landing parking lot and dock areas. Responsibilities include litter pick-up in the parking area and waiting area, cleaning the double vault toilet daily, and emptying the garbage cans into the dumpster.</p>
<p>The Provider will provide information and materials to any party traveling on the passenger ferry, including maps, recreation opportunity guides and "special alert" information provided by the Forest Service and/or as warranted for safe ferry operations.</p>
<p>Provider may be interested in providing a ticket sales outlet at Grand Island Landing. In the past this has been the base of operations for the Grand Island Ferry Service. The 18' by 40' office and gift shop is currently owned and operated by the previous permit-holder, "Grand Island Ferry Service." Interested parties are advised to contact the company regarding the disposition of the building for continued use as an office and gift shop. (Grand Island Ferry Service, P.O. Box 333, Wetmore, MI 49895).</p>
<p>Vehicular Transport Services</p>
<p>Provider shall provide transport of vehicles, equipment, supplies and other large items to and from Grand Island. At a minimum, services shall be offered between the periods from approximately June 1 through Columbus Day weekend. Services shall be provided on Monday and Friday mornings between 8am and noon. If the trip cannot be made due to inclement weather, the run will be made within 36 hours after the weather becomes suitable.</p>
<p>Provider should plan to make approximately 60 round trips per year and carrying an average of three to four vehicles per trip. Some days multiple trips may be needed to accommodate all of the vehicle needs. The most frequent users of the service are the island's seasonal residents. Additional trips on days other than Friday and Monday are sometimes needed to accommodate contractors or Forest Service maintenance crews.</p>
<p>Vehicle Stickers: The permit holder will ensure all vehicles transported have a current year Motor Vehicle Permit sticker or have authorization from the Forest Service.</p>
<p>Ferrying vessel shall accommodate all requested needs in the form for which it is intended. Vehicles needing transport include cars, pick-ups, SUV's, graders, loaders, loaded dump trucks, power company utility trucks, bulk fuel/gas trucks, and septic trucks. Vessels shall be U.S. Coast Guard approved and licensed and operated under existing regulation and law. Vessels shall be piloted by individuals licensed to do so. The vessel and the captains must be covered by liability insurance.</p>
<p>The Provider may use a Government furnished tug and barge after the barge's hull has been inspected, licensed, and certificated by the US Coast Guard at government expense. The tentative date for completion of this inspection and licensing process is August 1, 2013. Additional points about the government provided tug and barge are as follows:</p>
<p>-----The tug captains must be licensed by the US Coast Guard for the respective tonnage.<br />-----The Provider must provide liability insurance for the captains and vessel.<br />----- The permit holder will enter into a Vessel Agreement, as with the Kitchi-Miniss, that would spell out details of the operation and maintenance of the tug and barge. Items covered would be similar to those in the Kitchi-Miniss agreement.</p>
<p>All vessels, whether contractor-provided or government-provided, will be maintained on a daily basis by the permit holder for, meeting standards for safety, seamanship, mechanical, and cleanliness.</p>

<CONTACT>Phil Davis, 407-384-5335

<a href="mailto:phil.b.davis@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is about the Consolidated Product-Line Management (CPM) Next acquisition.  <br>  <br> The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI's) Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) Live Training Transformation (LT2) Consolidated Product-Line Management (CPM) approach focuses on the requirements, development, execution, management, and synchronization of the LT2 Product-Line (P/L).  <br>  <br> In 2001, PEO STRI put the LT2 P/L strategy in place. Today, through the use of the CPM contract, PM TRADE builds and maintains the LT2 P/L systems in support of home station training, deployed training, urban operations training, Maneuver Combat Training Centers (MCTCs) training, and instrumented live-fire range training. The LT2 P/L provides state-of-the-art training systems to the warfighter using over 120 common reusable software components, architectural infrastructure, interfaces, standards, processes, and information technology assets. The LT2 holistic paradigm provides an efficient Army training support system modernization strategy that: <br>  <br> provides key enablers for the Army's Live, Virtual, and Constructive domains, and Joint Integrated Training Environment (ITE)  <br>  <br> focuses on effective and current implementation of Information Assurance  <br>  <br> aligns with the DoD Training Transformation vision (i.e. Test & Training, Embedded Training, and Dual Use Equipment)  <br>  <br> incorporates Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts that facilitate architectural evolution to support DoD Net-centricity and the Army's vision for the Common Operating Environment (COE) <br>   <br>  <br> With over 150 systems fielded globally, the LT2 P/L successfully employs technical and acquisition strategies that significantly reduces fielding time, minimize acquisition costs, enables total ownership cost reductions across the live training domain and Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE), and enhances training benefits afforded to the Warfighter. <br>  <br> The CPM Next contract will continue to manage the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life-cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L. The CPM Next contract will continue to meet the requirement for a consolidated streamlined approach that protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment, continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LT2 P/L Construct, while continuing to provide PM TRADE an efficient, effective, and agile method to accomplish: <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>         development, integration, testing, management, maintenance, and evolution of the LT2 P/L (products, systems, Systems of Systems (SoS) capabilities, architectures, processes, and core assets) <br>  <br>         total life-cycle system management and P/L support  <br>  <br>         P/L support of products, systems, and SoS capabilities that leverage LT2 P/L assets <br>  <br>         architectural and system development, and core asset evolution in support of external interoperability initiatives such as LVC-ITE, COE, Joint services initiatives, and Foreign Military Sales as required within the LT2 P/L <br>  <br>         synchronization with other PEO STRI efforts and initiatives as required by the LT2 P/L (such as the Warfighter FOCUS contract) <br>  <br>  <br> CPM Next is the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a systems life cycle within a SoS environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based. CPM Next will continue to evolve the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of LT2 products. It enables using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.  <br>  <br> The anticipated nature and complexity of the LT2 P/L work tasks (ranging from P/L architectural development, system development, SoS management to P/L core asset variability, and configuration management) associated with the CPM Next requires mature and established processes, and therefore a level 3 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) company rating. <br>  <br> The Government is conducting market research with companies that are interested in this requirement. Specifically companies shall address the following topics within the context of the LT2 P/L domain.  <br>  <br> 1)     Specifically address ideas, strategies and solutions to enable the LT2 P/L to achieve PM TRADE Strategic Business Goals, listed below: <br>  <br>         reduce operational costs and complexity  <br>  <br>         align and support product development (common standards, interfaces, etc) <br>  <br>         enhance soldier training <br>  <br>         reduce sustainment and development costs <br>  <br>         increase technology agility <br>  <br>         leverage other Army systems and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies <br>  <br>         align to the Army COE, mobile computing, and distributed computing strategies  <br>  <br> 2)     Specifically address ideas, strategies, and solutions related to LT2 P/L Consolidated Post Development System Support (PDSS) and Post Production System Support (PPSS). Elaborate on how these ideas will result in cost avoidance, increased performance, sustained information assurance accreditation, and higher quality products.  <br>  <br> 3)     Specifically address ideas, strategies, and solutions related to LT2 P/L fielding Technical Data Packages (TDP). Intent is to address an integrated and open approach for LT2 P/L TDPs to be seamlessly incorporated into sustainment activities repositories.  <br>  <br> 4)     Specifically address ideas, strategies and solutions related to LT2 P/L development and sustainment of logistics products such as training, operator, and support manuals, to include TDP artifacts such as drawings, interface control documents, etc. Elaborate on how these ideas will result in cost avoidance, increased performance, enhanced usability and higher quality products.  <br>  <br> 5)     Specifically address ideas, strategies, and solutions related to SoS management & configuration management across the LT2 portfolio of systems and products across the life cycle.  <br>  <br> 6)     Specifically address ideas, strategies, and solutions related to optimized testing methodologies and environments across the life cycle within a P/L environment. Elaborate on how these ideas will result in cost avoidance, increased performance, and higher quality products.  <br>  <br> 7)     Contractual methodologies and teaming arrangements that would increase broad access to technical capabilities as needed in an agile fashion, while minimizing Government costs, such as associated pass through costs within teaming arrangements. <br>  <br> All strategies should strive to protect and leverage the Army's LT2 P/L investment, while evolving core assets and the LT2 Construct tools and processes to ensure technology relevance across the P/L.  <br>  <br> The Government is not requesting capability statements. Address only the above questions. Additionally, provide the company's Cage Code and DUNS number in the response. <br>  <br> A web-based portal hosts a reference library and contains a multitude of information related to PM TRADE LT2 and CPM efforts.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole source contract to Datacard Group, Inc. of Minnetonka, Minnesota.
<p>The purpose of the contract award is to provide identity card laminate, which the firm has previously developed to support the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. The purpose of this TSA program is to enroll and issue a secure uniform credential to the Maritime population in accordance with the Safe Port Act dated October 13, 2006. Datacard has the unique holographic laminate which contains customized features, and is used on a card printer that is manufactured by Datacard.<br /><br />Currently, TSA is in the critical phase of the TWIC deployment. Datacard is considered to the most advantageous source for the Government due to the following:</p>
<p>1) Compatibility of the laminate material and laminate spool with existing personalization system components of the TWIC System that are already being utilized to print cards, and <br />2) The additional cost and development time of procuring a customized laminate from another source in a short timeframe. Therefore, Datacard Group, Inc. is the only vendor available that can meet all the requirements and supply this product for the TWIC System.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the intentions of the TSA to enter into a contract with Datacard Group, Inc., on a single source basis, in accordance with the TSA Acquisition Management System. Alternative products will not be considered. This is notice of contract action and is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement.</p>

<p>The US Air Force is one of the largest developers and users of radio frequency (RF) and high power microwave (HPM) emitting devices in the world and consequently, has been at the forefront of research on the biological effects of RF/HPM radiation for more than 30 years. The mission of the 711 HPW/RHDR is to protect Air Force personnel from RF/HPM radiation hazards, while minimizing negative operational impact. This requires an extensive research program in the dosimetry and bioeffects of RF/HPM radiation. Research results are transitioned and transferred to national and international health and safety standards, which are used by the Air Force Surgeon General for occupational health and environmental safety. Additionally, data are used to support the rapid development and deployment of directed energy (DE) technologies. The advent of HPM and ultra-wide band directed energy weapons make the 711HPW/RHDR's products and services ever more essential to national security. Our goal is to provide the US Air Force with the world's best RF/HPM bioeffects research and science-based exposure standards, allowing maximum safe exploitation of directed energy for the national defense. With joint-service cooperation, we bring broad expertise, advocacy, and involvement in RF/HPM technology development. <br />The goal of this effort includes conducting bioeffects research to identify the benefits, risks, and capabilities for a wide range of military RF/HPM systems. Another goal is to predict and mitigate the bioeffects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and to exploit the bioeffects of directed energy for DE weapons applications. See BAA Solicitation and Attachments for the Technical Areas and details for this effort . Also, note in the BAA solicitation, the due date and time proposals are due at both locations at their local time, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, and Ft Sam Houston TX.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. * Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o Terminate the contract o Recompete the requirement o Issue a new solicitation o Refrain from exercising options under the contract o Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>* Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). * Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 52.233-4703 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM 05/01/2004 If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

All Contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered the U.S. Contractor Registration System SAMS at https://www.uscontractorregistration.com.
Contractor is responsible for ensuring contractor Registration and Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) are current.  Lack of registration in the SAMS database will make an offeror/quoter ineligible for award.  Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your proposal. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

  (i)    	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 
  (ii)   	PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii)	PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (iii) PRICE.
  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

Factor (i) - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 

Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items and/or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Therefore, offeror shall provide information that clearly demonstrated experience in performance on similar requirements.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

A list of technically acceptable/unacceptable ratings is listed below:

Technically Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings
Rating	Description
Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

Factor (ii) - PAST PERFORMANCE 

Information submitted as required by SECTION L Past Performance, will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.
  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

Evaluation of Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE is as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

Factor (iii)  Price

Award will be made to the responsible offeror that is rated outstanding or satisfactory in offering the lowest price.
 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from price.

All responsible Offerors are to submit CAGE code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, Tax Identification Number and all applicable specifications regarding this solicitation. 

Proposal must be received no later than 12:00 PM (PST), 06 Mar 2013, Quotes submitted as an attachment to an email should be sent in Word Version 6.0 or higher. Do not mail. Only electronic responses shall be accepted via e-mail.  Each submission should be virus scanned prior to being sent via e-mail to the POC listed: Charles E.
 Fletcher II email: charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil .  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice questions must be submitted via e-mail. The Government will make every attempt to answer all questions in a timely manner; however, questions submitted within 3 days of the posted closing day may not allow ample time to respond and offerors cannot be guaranteed a response will be issued.  

NOTE: Email submissions are subject to size and type restrictions (typically limited to less than 1 Megabyte in size and only non-executable attachments such as .doc or .pdf files) as well as any other appropriate network security measures.  It is the respondent's responsibility to verify the package was received and can be viewed.

The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. <br>  <br> (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br>  <br> (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the re-representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br>  <br> (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br>  <br> (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following re-representation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the re-representation was completed: <br>  <br> The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      . <br>  <br> (Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title). <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)  <br>  <br> This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation Number is HSCG38-13-R-H00006 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) using the procedures of FAR 12 in conjunction with FAR 15. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-65.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Total Small Business Set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard is 336412 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. Proposals from large business sources will not be considered under this Total Small Business Set-aside acquisition.</p>
<p>The complete detailed Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure is provided as a separate document, which offerors may use for their price proposal. The Statement of Work (SOW) is also provided as a separate document to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Description of the requirement: The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC requires overhaul of the Hamilton Sundstrand 54H60-117 Propeller Assembly and related components. Overhaul work shall be performed in accordance with Air Force Technical Orders (AFTO's) listed in the SOW in section 3.3. The USCG ALC requires overhaul of the following items:</p>
<p>Propeller Assembly, P/N 54H60-117, NSN: 1610-01-096-7677 Quantity 24 each; <br />Valve Housing Assembly, P/N 714325-5 NSN:1610-01-016-2196, Quantity 10 each; <br />Pump Housing Assembly, P/N 733872-6 NSN: 1610-01-220-6052, Quantity 4 each; <br />Propeller Spinner, P/N 554665 NSN: 1610-00-873-6251, Quantity 2 each; <br />Propeller Synchronizer, P/N: 774800-1 NSN: 1610-01-128-7400, Quantity 4 each; <br />Afterbody Half Body P/N: 560501 NSN: 1610-00-873-6424, Quantity 4 each. <br /><br />The 54H60-117 Propeller Assembly is used on the USCG HC-130H aircraft. The contractor must possess all tools, parts, test equipment, facilities, technical data, and AFTOs, including AFTO updates, necessary to overhaul the propeller assemblies and related components. The USCG does not control the AFTO process, does not own and does not have the ability to release the AFTOs. The contractor must be able to obtain the most recent AFTOs including updates to the AFTO's. The source for AFTOs is provided in the SOW under section 3.6.</p>
<p>The contractor must be either a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certified/Authorized Repair Station, a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Approved Maintenance Organization, or a Transport Canada Civil Aviation Directorate (TCCA) Approved Maintenance Organization authorized to overhaul the 54H60 Propeller Assembly and related components. Possession of at least one (1) of these Certifications is a minimum requirement. The contractor shall also have the capability to perform cold rolling of individual blades as specified in the AFTO or the ability to obtain it in such a manner to meet the Delivery Schedule established in the SOW section 7.0.</p>
<p>The Propeller Assemblies and related components are considered to be Flight Critical, therefore an Airworthiness Certification is required for all overhauled equipment. The contractor may choose to use the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 8130 Airworthiness Certificate however the USCG does not require use of this form. An alternate Airworthiness Certification developed by the contractor using language and format either the same or similar as used for commercial customers under FAA regulations may be used in accordance with the SOW section 10.2.1.</p>
<p>The USCG intends to ship all of the equipment listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services CLIN structure in one (1) shipment for overhaul and return to the USCG in accordance with the SOWs Delivery Schedule, however, due to the physical size of the Propeller Assembly offerors may propose the USCG employ a staggered shipping schedule for the Propeller Assemblies only beginning with a minimum of five (5) each providing the delivery schedule can be met. If a proposal does not propose a staggered shipping schedule it will be assumed the contractor can accept all of the equipment in one (1) single shipment. A staggered delivery schedule is acceptable for overhauled Propeller Assemblies, however, the minimum delivery requirement is five (5) each every 60 calendar days After Receipt of Material (ARM) at the Contractor's facility. Required delivery for all other items is 60 calendar days ARM at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made to the USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Bldg 63, Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909. Proposals shall be F.o.b. Destination shipping terms from the contractor's facility to Elizabeth City, NC. Accelerated and Aircraft of Ground (AOG) situations are addressed in the SOW in sections 7.2 and 7.3. Inspection and Acceptance shall be in accordance with FAR 52.212-4(a) and will performed by the USCG Aviation Logistics Center Quality Assurance Branch.</p>

<p><strong>Factor I: Technical Ability<br /><br /></strong>Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors ability to perform the overhaul work in accordance with the requirements of the SOW with emphasis on addressing the ability to overhaul equipment in accordance with the required technical data including any updates to technical data that may be issued during contract performance, ability to meet cold rolling requirements, the offerors approach in providing an Airworthiness Certification on all overhauled equipment, and the offeror's approach to meet required delivery schedules.<br /><br /><strong>Factor II: Quality Control System</strong></p>
<p>Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the offerors Quality Control System that will be used in performance of the contract with emphasis on inspection procedures, personnel involved in the inspection process including their qualifications and responsibilities, traceability of replacement parts to the original equipment manufacturer, warranty terms and duration, and address work that will be subcontracted including subcontractor qualifications and formal agreements between the offeror and subcontractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Factor III: Past Performance<br /></strong><br />Past performance will be evaluated for a performance risk assessment and will consider the relevance and the quality of the contractor's past performance. Relevancy will consider the offeror's experience in overhauling the Hamilton Sundstrand 54H60 model Propeller Assembly. Quality of past performance will consider quality issues and their resolution, timeliness of delivery, and customer satisfaction. Attachment C to the SOW is an "OFFERORS PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONAIRE". Offerors must include a complete Questionaire with their proposal for three (3) customer references. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and Government personnel who are experienced with the offerors performance.</p>
<p><strong>Factor IV: Price</strong></p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the offeror has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed. The Government intends to award a single contract for the overhaul of all equipment listed in the CLIN structure but reserves the right to break out CLINs and award more than one contract if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Proposals shall price ALL CLINs to be considered complete.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br /><strong>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Dec 2012</strong>) Offerors shall include a competed copy of this provision with its offer.

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>EVALUATON CRITERIA</p>
<p>1) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) - Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.</p>
<p>2) The Government will evaluate each proposal based on the factors below.</p>
<p>2A) Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be evaluated based on the offerors ability to provide the system detailed in the Description &amp; Specifications within the required delivery schedule. The proposed system must meet all of the requirements as set forth in the solicitation. This will be evaluated based on the offerors ability to fill in and validate the information in the matrix and product specification and or information sheets provided with the proposal. Likewise, Offerors are cautioned against general, vague, or unsubstantiated statements, which prevent or render difficult the Government's evaluation of the proposal. Statements such as "will comply," or "noted and understood" without supporting narrative to define compliance are not acceptable. Moreover, the Government will not assume that an Offeror possesses any capability, understanding, and/or commitment that is not specifically delineated and supported in its respective proposal.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Item clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation and can be validated through the matrix and any additional product specification and or informational sheets provided by the offeror<br />Unacceptable Item does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation and cannot be validated through the matrix and any additional product specification and or informational sheets provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>2B) Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated. Each Offeror's price proposal shall be evaluated to determine if it is complete, consistent and reasonable with the Offeror's technical approach, reflects a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements and does not contain any material imbalances. A proposal may be deemed unbalanced if the pricing methodology illustrates unreasonable variances in the establishment of the unit, or quantity price ranges. An offer may be deemed unbalanced if the mathematical approach is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated on total value of the CLINs offered (including all option CLINs).</p>
<p>As such, Offeror(s) that are materially unbalanced, unrealistically low, or otherwise not in the government's best interest may be rejected. In its evaluation, the government may use published data, same or similar DoD contracts, government estimates, industry standards, DCAA audit information, or other information as deemed appropriate by the government</p>
<p>All cost/price information shall be in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>2C) Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated but not rated on the ability of the Offeror being able to adequately support their stated capabilities to accomplish the work defined in the RFQ by illustrating work similar in size, scope and/or complexity and are recent and relevant to that defined for the effort, accomplished during the past three (3) years. The offeror shall ensure that accurate and concise information is provided for each reference, whether the data is for the prime or the subcontractor, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract/Vendor Name &amp; Address<br />&bull; Contract No.<br />&bull; Contract Award Date<br />&bull; Completion Date<br />&bull; Contract Value<br />&bull; Type of Contract<br />&bull; Description of Contract Requirements<br />&bull; Contract Point of Contact (POC)<br /><br />Past Performance is used as an indicator of the capability of the Offeror to provide consistent quality of technical and management elements of the program. Offerors are advised that the Government may use and evaluate independently obtained past performance data, such as, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ), as well as, and in addition to all recent and relevant past performance data provided by the Offeror. If responsibility cannot be verified, a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7) shall be requested from the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>

PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference (provisions and clauses may be obtained via the internet: http://farsite.hill.af.mil): 
The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to offerors- Commercial applies to this acquisition
52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, past performance and price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

BASIS OF AWARD:  1) The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract or multiple awards to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors. 
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer that meets the technical aspects of the solicitation.  Competing offeror's technical aspects will be evaluated as significantly more important than past performance and price considerations. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 
A.	Technical: Technical can be measured by the offeror's ability to perform requirements to meet technical, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and all local, state, and federal regulations as related to performing projects. 

B.	 Past Performance Confidence Assessment: 
1) Past Performance, the offeror shall provide relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the past and present references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources as well as questionnaires. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the recency requirement, will be excluded from evaluation. 
2) Past performance will address areas pertaining to the following attributes to which an assessment will be made: 
3) Quality: The quality of work can be measured by how well the offeror conformed to or met contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical professional, environmental, or safety and health standards.) 

. 
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

4) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 
5) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.
6) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe for this definition of recency will be excluded from evaluation. 
7) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?Substantial Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer,  mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Offeror to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, Offeror must submit a completed copy of this provision with its proposal for the proposal to be considered. See https://orca.bpn.gov/ for online submittal);

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>

<DESC>INCORRECT SOLICITATION NUMBER POSTED:<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency - Energy (DLA Energy), Bulk Petroleum Supply Chain Services Directorate intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Shaw Group, Inc. (Shaw) for a fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirements contract for continued remediation operations at Defense Fuel Supply Point (DFSP) Point Loma. DFSP Point Loma is part of the Navy Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) San Diego, CA. The proposed period of performance is July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2016. Shaw currently provides environmental services in the Tank 63 area of FLC San Diego, Point Loma, CA under contract SP0600-10-D-5047. Shaw's assessment of Tank 63 area resulted in the discovery of a larger than anticipated plume. Shaw has taken actions to operate a temporary free-product recovery, system and monitor the perimeter of the plume. Under the current contract, as directed by DLA Energy, Shaw operates the existing product recovery system for the Tank 63 area plume area and has designed a permanent free-product recovery/ground water system, the DFSP Point Loma Remediation System, for the long-term remediation of the plume area.
<p>Under the proposed action, Shaw will operate the installed DFSP Point Loma Remediation System and continue assessment and monitoring activities. These activities will include the monitoring of the designed and installed system to optimize its functioning and to document the operation and maintenance of the system. Documentation developed under the anticipated action will be completed only after the installation and optimized operation of the system. Documentation will be finalized only after clarification and validation during the system's operation and shall be used in a future non-restrictive procurement for environmental remediation services at DFSP Point Loma.</p>
<p>The Navy FLC is concurrently engaged in MILCON Project P401, which commenced in 2009, for the demolition of all existing storage and tanks at FLC San Diego. This project also operates in the Tank 63 area. The installation and operation of the DFSP Point Loma Remediation System is planned to coordinate with the phases of the MILCON Project P401 without impeding its progress.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 [[o]nly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency needs]. Firms believing they can provide the service required must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations and award of this requirement will not be delayed to qualify a new contractor. Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Prospective contractors MUST be actively registered in the SAM database to be eligible for award. Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.). This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation. Responses concerning this solicitation should be directed to the Contracting Officer by e-mail to Jacob.Vigil@dla.mil no later than 8 March 2013.</p>

  For any questions or to resolve any problems for attendance to this Industry Day, please contact Ms. Susan Campbell at (202) 264-7803.

All attendees will be required to present photo identification to obtain their visitor IDs.  The TB-34() Industry Day conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.  Please RSVP no later than March 8, 2013 to susan.campbell@urs.com and please carbon copy mercedes.burrell@navy.mil and david.diamantopoulos@navy.mil.
  RSVPs received after March 8, 2013 will not be accepted and attendance will be denied.  There is no registration fee for attending this Industry Day Conference.

This Industry Day Conference is in support of the Naval Sea System Commands upcoming TB-34() competitive procurement.

 This array must provide high reliability, achieved by lower power requirements and reduced complexity.  The TB-34() array will use an electro-optical Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC) to enable the bandwidth required to be sent from the array to the submarine.  The TB-34()s acoustic capability will be processed by the AN/BQQ-10 host sonar system.

  During Industry Day there will be NO opportunities to ask questions or discussions between individual industry representatives and Government technical Program Office representatives.  However, the Government will provide Industry the opportunity to document UNCLASSIFIED questions that arise during the conference on forms supplied at the Conference.  The Government will collect ALL written questions prior to the conclusion of Industry Day.  The written questions will be answered via a follow-up post electronically on NECO/FedBizOpps following the Industry Day.  In addition, UNCLASSIFIED electronic mail questions regarding the forthcoming Industry Day received before the close of business on March 6, 2013 will be accepted by the NAVSEA Contract Specialist Mercedes Burrell at mercedes.burrell@navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the proposal due date until March 1, 2013 until 4:30pm EST.
EPA anticipates that the dollar value of the resultant order will be between $100,000 and $125,000.



The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items for Solicitation Number: RFQ-OH-13-00050, which was posted on 01/25/2013 is amended to reflect a change to the Performance Work Statement as well as to respond to vendor questions.
The following questions were received in response to the combined synopsis/solicitation. Answers are provided below each question.
Question 1.  Is delivery of product 30 days after contract award a hard requirement or can it be extended for a reasonable time based of progress toward delivery? Answer:  No, delivery will be extended to up to 75 days after award.
Question 2.  Is the EPA looking for a blimp based aerostat solution only or will they consider all reasonable solutions which meet the stated requirements? Answer:  All reasonable solutions will be considered.
Question 3.  Is there an incumbent who has previously provided an aerostat product or solution? Answer:  The specifications of this system are unique when compared to other Agency systems.
Question 4.  Is this a single item purchase or is there a possibility for additional item procurements in the future for this device? Answer:  There is a possibility for additional item procurements.
Question 5.  Will this award be based on lowest cost, technically acceptable criteria regardless of the solution proposed? Answer:  Yes
Question 6.  Is there any information or standards that define the payload mounting hardware, payload interconnects, data interconnects or interface with the ground station? Answer: The payload is a stand-alone system supplied by the Agency.  The payload must be securely fastened and able to withstand turbulence as specified.
Question 7.  If the payload is a camera, does the camera mounting system need to have pan, tilt zoom capabilities? Answer:  Both static-mounted and pan, tilt, zoom cameras are optional instruments that the Agency would attach to their sampling platform.
Question 8.  Would you consider integrating the autopilot system into your own sourced out airframe? Answer: No
Question 9.  What is the chemistry of the 4400 mAh, 25.9V battery described with the payload capacity?  Is it a LiPo? Answer: Yes, it is a lithium polymer battery.

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: N00173-13-R-RV04<br />Notice Type: Solicitation/Request for Proposal<br />Classification Code: AC14 - R&amp;D Defense System: Aircraft (Engineering Development)<br />NAICS Code: 541 - Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services<br />541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: 12:00pm Local Time, 23 March 2013</p>
<p>To accomplish airborne-related S&amp;T requirements, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has tasked the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1) to provide the necessary aircraft and support personnel. In turn, NRL maintains a Military Support Division (MSD), Code 1400, that ensures military and contractor personnel are available to meet project requirements. MSD also provides coordination and serves as a liaison between the scientific communities at NRL, other government activities and VXS-1 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland. VXS-1 employs numerous aircraft to accomplish ground and flight test evolutions.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity associated with the development of advanced technology weapons systems, NRL's MSD and VSX-1 must augment their staff with specialized managerial, engineering, administrative and technical support. This augmentation ensures project continuity and provides highly qualified expertise and unique knowledge, not normally found in Fleet personnel. The technical and engineering personnel provide the expertise required for the performance of specialized design, fabrication, installation, operation, removal and maintenance of unique research systems associated with VXS-1 airborne research laboratories.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contract period will be for a one-year base and two one-year option periods, with a total estimated contract value of $21M.</p>
<p>The work to be performed under this contract will be performed at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Washington, DC and other field sites.</p>
<p>A complete performance work statement (PWS), quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP), personnel requirements, and contract data requirements are available as part of this solicitation.</p>
<p>A DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification, shall be applicable to any prospective work covered under this solicitation. Prospective contractors must have: (1) the required SECRET facility clearance and (2) personnel available with favorably adjudicated investigations and final DoD granted personnel security clearances.</p>
<p><strong>Note: NRL does not sponsor clearances for contractors.</strong></p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be a 100% set-aside for small businesses. The Government anticipates award of an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with firm-fixed-price and cost-plus-fixed-fee term-type task orders.</p>
<p>NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. <br />Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.</p>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, is issuing a Request for Information for expert services in the area of Sign language interpreting in support of hearing/speech-impaired IT personnel employed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Corporate Information Office. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541930. Interpreter    <br>    <br>    2. Background. The United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) is required to obtain sign language interpreting and on-site interpretation services (Rehabilitation act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act) for its deaf employee located at the USACE headquarters in Washington DC. These services are needed to provide: (a) on-site sign language interpreting for the USACE employee and (b) additional interpreting for meetings and training activities requiring more than two hours of continuous interpreting.   <br>    <br>  USACE's deaf employee is located at the USACE headquarters within the GAO building in Washington D.C. Sign language services are needed to communicate information, work assignments, training courses, and staff meetings. The employee is profoundly deaf without the ability to communicate through verbal means.  Additionally, interpreting services may be needed occasionally by applicants, or for USACE sponsored activities that may be attended by deaf persons from outside the agency. Also, it is reasonable to assume that the need for interpreting will increase over the next five years.   <br>    <br>  3.  Scope.  The scope of this action is to provide contract services support to USACE, Corporate Information Directorate, Governance and Architecture Division (CECI-A) organization in support of the CECI-A employees and in compliance with legally mandated requirements.  <br>    <br>  4.
