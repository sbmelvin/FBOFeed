<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract under the authority of 13.501 to Oak Hill Genetics, Inc., 21434 Oak Hill Rd, Ewing, IL 62836, for the performance of the described requirement in support of the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio (NAMRU-SA).
<p>The requirement intends to provide the delivery of up to 1,000 healthy male, female Yorkshire and Landrace swine weighing between 20-90kgs, per 12 month ordering period. Additionally, the swine shall be healthy, raised in environmentally controlled facilities and disease free. Also the Swine shall be at the required weight in 100% of the ordered quantities in each delivery, or the entire shipment shall be replaced. This requirement is in support of research that focuses on the protection, resuscitation and stabilization of combat casualties at Echelon 1 and 2 points of care in the combat theater in support of the NAMRU-SA, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The animal facility requires United States Department of Agriculture approved Class A animal breeder license. Shipment of animals should be in closed climate-controlled vehicles to prevent exposure to outside air and extreme temperatures that may induce stress on the animal.</p>
<p>Critical on-going NAMRU-SA future scientific research efforts are required to have healthy, disease free swine from one vendor; this will ensure the scientific data generated is consistent, which is critical when testing different vendor devices under that same research environment. Due to the early involvement of Oak Hill Genetics, Inc. in providing swine in this ongoing research effort; they must continue to provide this supply until commencement to avoid the injection of inconsistency in study results. In addition, it is imperative that the new data is being created, collected and reviewed under the same controls as previous data collection efforts to ensure consistent analysis is being performed. This is essential to the integrity of the entire study and can only be accomplished through the use of the same supplier. In addition, Oak Hill Genetics has an established history of delivering 100% healthy lots. Loss of one or two animals due to diseases will cause a major disruption on data collection and data analysis. The estimated period of performance of the project is 60 months.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 21 April, 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: thomas.a.guba.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation (CSS) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Subpart 13.5--Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br /><br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-CSS-18-337 and the solicitation is issued as a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.5--Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97, dated January 2018.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for this requirement.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</p>
<p>The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with size standard of 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. <br /><br />The NIA Clinical Research Unit conducts human studies that require continuous cardiac monitoring. The current system is very old and unserviceable. Most of the equipment is unusable and we have limited options for monitoring. When the last unit fails, clincal studies requiring carding monitoring must be stopped. Therefore, a new method of monitoring participants is critical to continuing present and future research studies requiring cardiac monitoring.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The central station is needed to continuously monitor participants from the nurses' station. The telemetry system is wireless and is hooked up to the participant for mobile monitoring. The mobile care viewer allows the nurses to monitor the participants from other areas on the unit. Wireless network system links all the above together.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS <br />Salient Characteristics: <br />&bull; Deliver accurate, real-time physiological patient data <br />&bull; Work easily within existing IT infrastructure<br />&bull; Modern bedside monitoring platform and intuitive touchscreen, plus exceptional visibility.<br />&bull; Portable Solution <br />&bull; High-Acuity Solution <br />&bull; Impressive Flexibility <br />&bull; Convenient ECG Options <br />&bull; Multiple Printing Options <br />&bull; Comprehensive Central Monitoring Capabilities <br />&bull; Streamlined Connectivity <br />&bull; Specific for patients<br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
