<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to enter into sole source negotiations and subsequently award a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract modification to Thales Missile Electronics Limited. This acquisition is for the production of  Multi-Application Fuze Initiation System and Crush Switch for the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) AGM-154C (Navy and FMS) for fiscal year 2010.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Unless stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  The JSOW Multi-Application Fuze Initiation System was designed and developed by Thales Missile Electronics Limited (TME).  TME is the sole designer/developer and is the only company with the knowledge, experience and access to the technical data necessary to fulfill the Government's need and meet its schedule requirements.  Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with TME at the following address: Thales Missile Electronics, Mountbatten House Basing View,  Basingstoke,  Hampshire, RG21 4HJ, United Kingdom.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) requires delivery of, and licenses to use, non-commercial, off-the-shelf Ship Air Defence Model (SADM) software and subscriptions to maintenance for same, for a term of five years.  The requirement is estimated to include, by the end of the five year term: (1) qty 24 additional licenses/seats to SADM Analysis Edition (AE), (2) qty 25 additional licenses/seats to SADM Tactical Edition (AE), (3) qty 1 agency-wide license (presently scheduled for release in CY 2009), with keys appropriate to upgrade all existing Navy seats to SADM AE and TE Version 4 software products (from the current Version 3 software products), (4) qty 1 agency-wide license (presently scheduled for release in CY 2012), with keys appropriate to upgrade all existing Navy seats to SADM AE and TE Version 5 software products (from Version 4 software products), and (5) qty 69 (ultimately, by the end of the term) subscriptions to software updates / maintenance (it is possible only 59 would be separately priced if 10 new seats were purchased in CY 2013) .  
Required Features of the Modeling and Simulation software:  (1) Software is programmed to simulate a ship's air defense system against missile attack with hard-kill, soft-kill, and hard-kill/soft-kill interaction.  (2) Software is adapted to USN ship's air defense systems as well as USN electronic warfare systems.

Because the licenses convey only restricted rights, and all other known alternative software products have function, compatibility, and interface deficiencies relative to Government needs, and because, alternative software products would require replacement of the existing infrastructure of software, as well as the additional seats cited by this synopsis, the Government anticipates, in accord with FAR 6.302-1, to solicit BAE Systems Australia Limited on a sole source basis; see NOTE 22.  RFP N00178-09-R-3033 will be issued when this synopsis has been published for at least 15 days; time from publication of this synopsis to award of a contract may take as little as 45 days.  The Government anticipates/intends making award of a firm fixed-price contract to BAE Systems Australia Limited for the requir! ed software in May 2009.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 5 in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Radiation Solutions, Inc. for the purchase of a RS-501 ConsoleUnit.  When two or more of the models RSX-4 and RSX-5 Sodium Iodide Integrated detector spectrometers (currently in use by EPA) are used simultaneously, the RS-501 interface console facilitates and simplifies the interconnection control, setup and monitoring of these large volume 16 L (1024 in3) detectors.  The RS-501 allows full and easy access for full control and monitoring and eliminates the limitations of daisy chaining the units.  The data collected by this technology will provide EPA's On-Scene-Coordinators (OSCs), Health Physics, Toxicologists and Federal Health Experts with ready access to radiological specific information to facilitate decision making during radiological or nuclear terrorism, nuclear power plant disasters, non-terrorism radoilogical environmental emergency responses, and other CERCLA removal and remedial actions.  The EPA recently purchased three RS-500 units providing advanced digital gamma-ray spectrometers for airborne applications and mapping ground-based gamma contamination.  The RS-501 console provides for all of the interfacing and communication between multiple detector units and the user's data acquisition as well as a set-up port.  The recently purchased RS-500 units require the RS-501 console in order to work effectively and efficiently and is specifically manufactured for the RS-500 units.  It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source due to the need for compatibility of the existing units.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 334519.  The EPA has only one known source for this requirement that is in the government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, please submit your capability statement via email to the U.S. EPA, c/o Elaine Scott at: scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 2pm EST, April 3, 2009.  NO CALLS PLEASE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SCAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Faces and Voices of Recovery, 1010 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 708, Washington, DC   20005.

The Purpose of this contract is to sponsor Faces & Voices of Recovery, a coalition public awareness project working to help solve America’s problem of alcohol and drug addiction, for the past nine years.  The collaboration of SAMHSA/CSAT and Faces & Voices of Recovery is successfully working to expand the Nation’s consumer- and community-based recovery network which helps to increase the number of individuals reaching out to educate others about substance use disorders, treatment and long-term recovery, based on their personal recovery experience.  In addition, Faces & Voices of Recovery continues to encourage and empower their membership to heighten awareness of the need to expand the Nation’s treatment capacity and to reduce barriers to treatment – including increasing access for Americans with disabilities.  Faces & Voices of Recovery promotes an anti-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing environment for individuals in long-term recovery, including those in recovery through medication assisted therapies. 

Faces & Voices of Recovery works in support of SAMHSA’s matrix area of Substance Abuse Treatment Capacity and Cross-Cutting Principles of Collaboration with Public and Private Partners; Recovery/Reducing Stigma and Barriers to Service; Cultural Competency/Eliminating Disparities.

In addition, there is a growing need for consumer education on the rights and responsibilities of people in recovery in order to regain “a life in the community.”  Faces & Voices of Recovery has proven successful in educating and empowering individuals to speak out about addiction, treatment and long-term recovery, and become voting and active citizens in their community.  SAMHSA/CSAT, Faces & Voices of Recovery as well as consumers of treatment services—those currently needing treatment services, those in treatment and individuals in recovery, as well as family members and friends—continue to join forces to transform treatment and recovery services available to all Americans.  

SAMHSA/CSAT is working to create a consumer-driven system of care where consumers actively participate in the decision-making role in available and effective treatment options to meet their individual needs.  SAMHSA/CSAT is also working to help lower barriers to finding and maintaining long-term recovery from addiction to alcohol and drugs.  This includes working to educate and reduce barriers and the stigma associated with medication assisted options and recovery for alcohol, illicit drugs and opioid dependent individuals. 
 
Faces & Voices of Recovery also works to create educational materials and outreach opportunities to increase access to treatment and recovery services.  Faces & Voices aims to support and foster a more compassionate community response to addiction and recovery, and ultimately, discourage and minimize substance use disorders nationwide.  Faces & Voices of Recovery also possesses ample experience in the provision of training modules for grass roots organizations, the treatment field, health care providers and others in local social service organizations including the faith community and community-based organizations.  Faces & Voices of Recovery maintains a speaker and participant pool of voices of recovery for SAMHSA/CSAT-sponsored events and activities.  Through these contacts, Faces & Voices participates in National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (Recovery Month) activities throughout the country and other consumer-related educational efforts to help put a face and name on the effectiveness of treatment and the power of recovery.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SCAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Entertainment Industries Council, Inc., 1856 Old Reston Avenue, Suite 215, Reston, VA   20190.

The proposed SAMHSA-sponsored  project National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, now in its 20th year, highlights the societal benefits of substance use disorder treatment, lauds the contributions of treatment providers and promotes the message that recovery from substance use disorders in all its forms is possible.  The September observance also encourages citizens to take action to help expand and improve the availability of effective treatment for those in need.  The month-long celebration educates policymakers, federal, state and local government entities, business leaders, substance abuse providers, and the general public about substance abuse as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the crucial role treatment plays in reclaiming lives ravaged by substance use disorders.  All activities and products produced and distributed in connection with the celebration advertise and promote the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) as leaders in the federal effort to expand the availability of effective substance use disorder treatment and recovery services to all Americans.

The Major League Baseball initiative will be an integral part of SAMHSA/CSAT's 20th annual National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (Recovery Month).  The effort herein being proposed is to work with local organizations in coordinating and sponsoring Recovery Month events involving the professional baseball community in the recognition of the need to support alcohol and drug addiction treatment and that addiction knows no boundaries in race, gender, culture and social and economic status.  Baseball has been coined as America’s National pastime and millions of Americans tune into and attend Major League Baseball (MLB) games.  MLB players and coaches become household names and are admired as heroes and leaders by children and adults.  They are seen to add value to events, initiatives and activities by civic leaders and the community and therefore are used to encourage participation and involvement due to their draw.

SAMHSA/CSAT's Recovery Month and the MLB initiative will be linked to and mentioned in all advertising for the celebration.  SAMHSA/CSAT plans to promote and distribute materials through conference exhibits, workshop opportunities, community stakeholders, and the recovery community.  All Recovery Month community-based events will be posted on the Recovery Month web page and identified as “SAMHSA-Sponsored”.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<RESPDATE>041409
<CONTACT>Nora V Tyson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SCAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Association for Children of Alcoholics 11426 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  

Title:  Non-Denominational Individual and Family Recovery Resources Training (Phase V)

The purpose of this SAMHSA sponsored contract is to providing the faith community with training, consumer-related education resource tools, and teaching them how to connect needed recovery-oriented resources within their local community, they can facilitate efforts to reach persons who are suffering from their own or a family member’s addiction within their congregation.

Faith-based organizations have historically had a noticeable effect on communities and individual behavior. The local faith community is uniquely positioned to help persons affected by alcohol or drug addiction or members of their families break down the barriers they feel are impenetrable in seeking help for their problems.  Issues of alcohol and drug misuse, dependency and addiction affect the counseling work and efforts in providing spiritual direction to hurting congregants.  Yet, many congregation-based leaders currently have neither the full knowledge nor the skills to work in resolving these issues with individuals and families facing addiction-related problems. But, with training and resources, the faith community can be an effective facilitator in finding the help and services needed, especially if they have at hand the necessary tools to help the individual and family begin recovery.  

In addition, faith leaders can help to educate others in the congregation to assist in the reduction of stigma and discrimination and the elimination or barriers associated with the achievement of SAMHSA’s mission, “a life in the community for everyone.”  

As with all HHS/SAMHSA activities and events, there will be consideration and emphasis to promote the interests of special groups and minorities.  These groups include African American, Asian Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indian, older Americans, adolescents and youth, individuals with co-occurring illness and the disabled community.  In order to accomplish their goals, SAMHSA creates opportunities to join alliances with all levels of government agencies, the business community, recovery community, professional organizations and affiliates within the substance abuse treatment field.  These relationships help to foster support to spread the word about the efficacy of treatment and reduce the stigma associated with substance abuse treatment.

This initiative will work with, complement and enhance the effectiveness of existing SAMHSA/CSAT family and faith-based educational resources. Efforts to increase consumer-related outreach, training and educational material targeted to faith leaders can enhance their congregants’ awareness about alcohol and drug problems. In addition, these materials provide clergy with appropriate information and congregation education materials to address these problems.  

This effort complements the work started through SAMHSA/CSAT’s Faith Initiative - “Clergy Guide” on alcohol and drug problems.  This effort will bring the guide to life in each congregation through an in-house training program on how to implement the suggested steps mentioned in the clergy guide.  The effort will also provide collateral materials for individuals and family members to intervene with appropriate treatment and support needed to recover from alcohol and drug addiction.

This initiative supports SAMHSA’s matrix area of expanding the Substance Abuse Treatment Capacity and Prevention and Early Intervention -- cross-cutting principles of Collaboration with Public and Private Partners; Recovery/Reducing Stigma and Barriers to Service; Cultural Competency/Eliminating Disparities.		

It is proposed to use the previous work and experience completed by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) to facilitate this initiative.  This effort will use existing materials, such as publications and videos, and repackage them for use at the congregational level across denominations.  Topics will include understanding addiction and the importance of finding the support and help for the affected individuals and family members, and to empower them to initiate and sustain steps toward recovery.  In addition, the initiative will create and conduct training programs for representatives of faith congregations in designated cities. These training programs will demonstrate to clergy how to use the materials effectively to provide support, direction and hope for their congregants and other consumers in these communities. 

These materials will be provided directly to members of faith congregations to help support their individual and family efforts to address alcohol and drug problems, to intervene as appropriate, and to find the support they need to prevent or recover from alcohol and drug addiction. 

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Elsworth Dory, 6101 Marlin Lane, Camp Springs, MD 20748.

Under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
Regulation (42 CFR Part 8) compliance with narcotic treatment standards are monitored and enforced through a process of on-site surveys and inspections by accrediting bodies.  Under this Regulation, an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) shall be considered for certification by SAMHSA if the program is accredited by a SAMHSA-approved accreditation body.  Accreditation, along with additional information, serves as the basis by which SAMHSA will make the determination the opioid treatment services are provided by qualified individuals and that the OTP is in compliance with standards that address the medical use of opioid drugs.

For-cause inspections are directed toward programs that are suspected of violating established Federal opioid standards, accreditation elements, providing substandard treatment, threatening the public health or being a possible source of diverted medications. In carrying out these responsibilities, the consultant supports the Director of the Division of Pharmacologic Therapies (DPT), and the Team Leader of the Certification and Waiver Team, DPT, CSAT, and SAMHSA in programs and services of national importance.  Understanding of the substance abuse and health delivery systems is essential, as is knowledge of pharmacologic treatment.

The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert consultation to CSAT to help assure that CSAT’s regulation of OTPs is consistent with the experience from the past.  DPT seeks assistance in facilitating implementation and interpretation of regulations, guidelines, inspectional findings, and proposed compliance actions.
	
The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The United States General Services Administration wishes to procure a construction firm to provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to restore the exterior façade of the Edward N. Cahn U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building in Allentown, Pennsylvania. After twelve years, the building envelope is showing signs of wear and is in need of repair. Generally, the work consists of cleaning and repointing all facades, repairing and rebuilding planter/property walls, restoring miscellaneous cast stone monuments, and cleaning and repainting an entrance canopy. In addition, the work includes removing and replacing sealant from all exterior windows, doors and louvers, installing a new flagpole, and repairing in-ground light fixtures.
This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. All contractor personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to construction start. The period of performance for this project is one hundred eighty (180) days.
The estimated cost of construction is between $300,000.00 and $500,000.00.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

This action is anextension of work currently on contract.Under contract DAAB07-02-C-C403, The Boeing Company is responsible fordeveloping and acquiring numerous Software Communications Architecture(SCA) compliant waveforms, defining common form-fit-function configurationsfor vehicular and aviation versions of the JTRS hardware, and successfullyporting the waveforms to JTRS hardware produced by two differentmanufacturers.  GMR is a software reprogrammable radio providing thewarfighter with a multi-band and multi-mode capable, networkable radiosystem that provides simultaneous voice, data and video communications toincrease interoperability, flexibility and adaptability in support of thevariedmission requirements.

This modification will procurethe additional radios needed in order to meet the communicationsrequirements of Future Combat Systems (FCS).  The anticipated value of thisprocurement is between $53M and $68M, depending on the final quantity to beprocured.  Delivery of these radios to FCS will begin on or around October2010.

<DESC>PM Soldier Equipment is responsible for the development and fielding of all clothing and individual equipment worn by the Soldier.  There is an immediate need for personal cooling systems (PCS) that can mitigate heat stress for Soldiers deployed in the Middle East  particularly during the summer months when the high air temperatures and radiant load from the sun and hot surfaces can cause the body to gain heat.  These environmental conditions, combined with the use of heavy protective clothing and carrying a load of supplies and equipment, can put a thermal strain on Soldiers, especially when they are working and their metabolic heat production increases.<BR>In extremely hot environments and/or at high activity levels, the only way the body can lose excess heat is by the evaporation of sweat from the body surface.  The rate of evaporative cooling is dependent upon the vapor between clothing layers.  Unfortunately, protective clothing such as body armor and helmets can inhibit the evaporations of sweat.  In addition, the weight, rigidness, and design of protective garments may increase the energy cost associated with wearing them during activity.  Consequently, Soldiers operating in hot environments often experience heat stress symptoms that effect performance on extended operations.<BR>To overcome these limitations, the Army has been searching for new technological advances in personal cooling systems (PCS) that have been developed by manufacturers and has been evaluating their effectiveness for military use.  These systems are designed to enhance the performance and comfort of people working in hot environments.  Active cooling has been successfully applied in many HAZMAT situations where the user is completely sealed in a protective suit.  This protective suit often requires supplemental air supply, and it is impermeable to the transport of evaporated sweat to the environment, thus severely limiting evaporative cooling of the body.  In these work applications, the wearer can be tethered to a system (e.g., PCS circulating chilled water in tubes over the body torso so that the cooling never stops.  Alternatively, the worker may have direct access to replacement cooling components (e.g., frozen gel packs).  The Soldier on the other hand is not completely isolated from the surroundings, however, he is often working at high metabolic rates, carrying a load, and moving from one place to another.  This creates a unique set of operational and technical requirements for the successful application of an active cooling system in the field.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center intends to release request for proposal W91CRB-09-R-XXXX on or about 20 April 2009 for procurement of Dismounted Soldier Cooling Studies. The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis. The solicitation will result in award of one (1) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and/or time and materials delivery orders for a total of five (5) years. The minimum guarantee will be one (1) base year of services/testing. The official release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the internet at the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) web site located at the following address: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm. The on-line version of the RFP includes all documents of the solicitation package. No hard copy of this RFP will be issued. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the solicitation. The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response.

<DESC>This notice attempts to identify additional sources to meet future SINCGARS sustainment requirements. Contract number W15P7T-05-D-J101 was awarded on a competitive basis to ITT Industries, Aerospace-Communications Division (ITT), 1919 W. Cook Road, Ft Wayne, IN 46801 on November 30, 2004 for the manufacture and support of the ITT designed SINCGARS assemblies, including the Integrated Communications Security(ICOM)RT-1523, RT-1523B, RT-1476, RT-1477, RT-1478, System Improvement Program (SIP) RT-1523C, and Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) RT-1523E and RT-1478D, and ASIP-Enhanced RT-1523F. This contract is a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract, with a five-year base period and two option years to produce SINCGARS, spare parts and sustainment support for the ITT family of SINCGARS products. Also included in this contract are the following ancillary devices that were independently researched and developed by ITT: ASIP-E 19 PIN Connector, GPS Fan-Out Box, Vehicle Remote Control Unit (VRCU) & Cables, Single ASIP Radio Mount (SARM) & Cables, Radio Based Combat Identification (RBCI) Responder Box, Control Display Unit (CDU) and Ethernet Fan-Out Box. ITT has Data Rights on items that were independently researched and developed. Any interested source must negotiate directly with ITT on Technical Data Rights issue on the above mentioned ancillaries. The Government is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations at a rate of up to 6000 equivalent Line Replacement Units (LRUs) (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. The contract includes configuration management responsibility (including obsolescence management) to address major obsolescence issues. To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the SINCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to ITT to support this ongoing redesign effort resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government. Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) which supports the manufacture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawings are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations. The Government is interested in identifying sources with the capability to produce the radio and associated LRUs, spare parts and CCAs over the next 5-6 years. Interested sources must demonstrate that they have the plant capacity to meet monthly demands of up to 6000 equivalent SINCGARS LRUs (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. In addition, interested sources must possess the necessary security clearance to process Communications Security COMSEC equipment.  Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy Army fielding and sustainment requirements. FAT will be required for all sources other than ITT, that are interested in the proposed action. Contract Number W15P7T-05-J101 also includes requirements for services, to include the repair of all hardware and ancillary items listed under the contract and hardware procured under the contract. Engineering support services are required to be performed throughout the length of the contract for efforts related to supportability analysis, development, manufacturing, testing and fielding of SINCGARS items delivered under this contract. Selected engineering tasks include, but are not limited to: 1) The evaluation of the maintenance concept to ensure the most cost-effective sparing options are maintained on elected models or assemblies affected by obsolete components 2) The update of field maintenance procedures as required, to include organizational level as well as the AN-GRM-122 software and technical documentation support, are required to be performed. Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) support of all system installations, training and field support of all SINCGARS equipment is also required to be performed under this contract. SINCGARS training support services and material are required to be provided. The CFSR support will include the responsibility to conduct in-country site surveys, installation kit development and spare parts packages and engineering support to resolve field identified technical issues with the SINCGARS radio system. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to meet the Governments requirements.  Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the required delivery schedule, shall respond in writing.  The response shall include a short introductory description (unclassified) outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production capabilities.  Responses from interested sources shall address their capability to act as a single provider for the SINCGARS, spares, and services. Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: Project Manager, Command Post, ATTN: SFAE-C3T-CP-TRC (James Bowden), Bldg 427, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, Telephone: 732-427-3062, Email: James.Bowden@us.army.mil Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: CECOM LCMC, Logistics and Readiness Center, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-COM-R-SR (Denis Chan), Building 1202W, Fort Monmouth, NJ  07703, Telephone: 732-532-1894, EMAIL Denis.Chan@us.army.mil<BR><BR>EMAIL Denis.Chan@us.army.mil

<DESC>The Department Of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15 Contracting Office intends to release a commercial solicitation for a CO2 Surgical Laser.  The laser must be able to ablate, incise and treat desired tissue structure and be compatible with ENT surgeries.   The laser must provide precise energy to the desired treatment area.  Magnification is required to treat very small areas.  It is requested that the laser have 3 modes: continuous, wave, and ultrapulse.  The ultrapulse is very important because it allows physicians to achieve desired tissue effect without thermal spread of energy and char.  This is critical when working with sensitive tissue like the larynx and vocal cords.  Continuous wave technology can not deliver very high energy for a sustained period.  As a result, thermal spread and charring are prevalent.  Furthermore, the lower power makes it difficult to ablate tissue. Additional desired features include:1. Automatic pre-set starting parameters, by specialty and application2. Programmable interface allowing staff to save individual MD's preferred settings.3. High pulse energy and average power. All contract details will be included in the Request For Quote, which will be released on or about April 1, 2009.  Any contractor who wishes to receive a copy of the RFQ may submit a request in writing.  A fax or e-mail response will be accepted. Fax number is 913-758-6495. The Contracting Office address is: VA Heartland Network 15, Network Business Office, Contracting Section (10N15-90), 4101 S. 4th Street Trafficway, Leavenworth, KS. 66048-5055.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) firms under NAICS Code 541990 “All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services,” to contract for services to create a new, cost-effective, sustainable activity between HRSA/MCHB programs and leading State, local entities and professional healthcare provider organizations to improve screening and intervention rates of both perinatal depression and intimate partner violence.

Evidence indicates two public health co-factors, prenatal and postpartum depression (PPD) and intimate partner violence (IPV), pose significant morbidity and mortality risks to the nation’s estimated six million pregnancies that occur each year.  Moreover, in spite of the well-documented health risks to mothers and children exposed to PPD and IPV, and MCHB’s efforts to increase screening and intervention rates (SI-rates) by providing grantees with either PPD or IPV technical assistance, combined PPD/IPV SI rates by MCHB-funded providers are unacceptably low.  Information is needed on how State and local perinatal women’s health and pediatric health professionals and health care providers are currently screening for both PPD and IPV, as well as how women are being referred for intervention services and what services and resources are available to them. In addition, resource materials are needed that provide practical steps to addressing the gaps and barriers that exist for health care providers and perinatal women’s health and pediatric health providers when screening and referring women. 

This activity joins PPD and IPV experts, health professional organizations, HRSA’s MCHB grantees (Healthy Start, State Title V Maternal and Child Health [MCH] Directors), other State and local public/private stakeholders and consumer advocates to define, develop, implement and assess the effectiveness and ability to generalize select IPV and PPD SI and prevention strategies to target areas.  Professional organizations include the: Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP); Family Violence Prevention Fund (FVPF); National Healthy Start (HS) Association; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Dental Association; Emergency Nurses Association; Association of Family Physicians; and, National Mental Health Association. This activity builds upon recent CDC-supported work completed by AMCHP and FVPF.

Under the proposed contract, the contractor will engage HRSA’s MCHB grantees, other stakeholders and consumer advocates in and be responsible for:

(1)	development of new resources to guide State/local public/private entities that address the co-factors of PPD and IPV for perinatal women and their children; 
(2)	tapping the unique insights of a diverse group of perinatal women’s and pediatric health care providers (i.e. Dentists, OB-GYN, Primary Care, Family Planning, Emergency Department and Pediatrics), MCH and HS Directors to collaboratively address IPV/PPD SI-rates; 
(3)	engaging the larger HRSA grantee community via webcasts at key points in the resource development phases; 
(4)	working intensively with six to eight States and their Healthy Start communities to pilot new resource materials and strategies respective to their barriers and gaps in eliminating PPD/IPV-associated poor maternal and child health clinical outcomes; and, 
(5)	supporting replication of these strategies in other State/local areas through the webcasts and by disseminating the newly developed resources for effectively and concurrently addressing PPD and IPV at the State and community-based levels. 

Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:

1.	Three to five new resources to guide State/local public/private entities that address the co-factors of PPD and IPV in perinatal women and their children. These resource must be produced in hard copy, 508-compliant web version, and compact disc formats;
2.	Six to eight interactive, facilitated webinars and two to three on-sight meetings in the Washington, DC area with MCH and HS Directors and other stakeholders and advocates to gather relevant insights and information during the resource development phase;
3.	Technical assistance to six to eight States and their HS communities to pilot new resource materials;
4.	Development and implementation of a dissemination and replication plan for the new resource materials that includes two webcasts;
5.	Hold yearly update meetings with the HRSA project officer and other HRSA staff;
6.	Quarterly progress reports containing information on services provided under the contract.

Qualified contractors must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your company’s experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each one separately) of the following requirements:

1.	Demonstrated experience in initiating, supervising, designing, producing, implementing, disseminating, assessing, and revising women’s and children’s risk-reduction resource materials and technical assistance for State and local women’s and children’s healthcare providers;
2.	Evidence of active collaborations with State Title V MCH Directors, national Healthy Start programs, AMCHP, FVPF and other State and local public/private stakeholders and consumer advocate entities;
3.	Experience in the field of public health maternal and child healthcare delivery, and perinatal depression and intimate partner violence screening, intervention, and training programs;
4.	Demonstrated awareness of cultural diversity and health disparities with respect to perinatal depression, intimate partner violence, and maternal and child health outcomes; and,
5.	Demonstrated experience with supervising, designing, producing, facilitating and implementing webinars involving public/private providers and administrators from diverse public health settings and professional backgrounds.

INTRODUCTION

This is a request for information only.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking information from industry that will assist in the assessment of new technology for the purpose of gas turbine engine testing. This information will also assist the Navy in formulating its requirements for a Turbo Prop Test Instrumentation (TPTI) System to be developed in support of Intermediate Level (I-level) testing of various versions of the T56 turboprop engine.

BACKGROUND

The functional capability of the TPTI System will be based on existing family testers for FanJet engines (JETI) and Shaft engines (SETI).  These testers are Personal Computer (PC) based test system designed to provide enhanced computer based measurement and automated data acquisition and control for the purpose of Intermediate (I-Level) testing.
The existing engine testers (JETI/SETI) consist of: (1) Power conditioning and distribution sufficient to provide clean battery-backed power from a range of AC input sources and generate all AC and DC power requirements; (2) rack-mount, ruggedized PCs; (3) Computer-based instrumentation which satisfies engine signal and test requirements (e.g. speed, accuracy, resolution); (4) engine adapter hardware, interface cables, and signal conditioning required for conveyance of engine signals; (5) transducers for conversion of physical signals into electrical form (e.g. vibration accelerometers, pressure transducers, thermocouples, etc.); and (6) an independent throttle system (dual throttle configuration in SETI, single throttle configuration in JETI).

These systems are similar in that they are employ VXI form factor instrumentation which interface with and are controlled from an external PC.  The computer systems are standard Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based ruggedized PC(s), running Windows-based operating system.  The computers communicate with the instrumentation via industry-standard protocols (e.g. VXI, LXI VISA, IVI, IEEE-802.3, etc.).  Engine application software is written with National Instrument’s LabView product.  The systems share a common architecture both in hardware, software and the “look and feel” of the user interface.

Existing systems (JETI and SETI) accommodate over 100 channels of A/D type analog inputs – including 48 channels of thermocouples and 36 pressure channels; 8 channels of frequency input, 9 channels of vibration signals, 112 channels of discrete inputs, 152 channels of discrete output (relays); 2 channels of timing/frequency, 2 channels of MIL-STD 1553 in JETI, and ARINC 429 in SETI.  The data acquisition process acquires all channels at approximately 100Hz and 200Hz for JETI and SETI respectively.  The Engine Test Program software communicates with the data acquisition to perform instrument setup and configuration and transfer acquired data as required to support engine test requirements.

PURPOSE OF REQUEST

As with any COTS based instrumentation and control system, obsolescence concerns with both hardware and software exist as a result of market driven technological advances. The government, therefore, is requesting information from industry suppliers of gas turbine engine test systems and subsystems that employ the latest in technology that may meet our requirement for a turboprop engine tester. All suppliers with an appropriate product relating the requirement for gas turbine engine testing are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the product’s capabilities set against the present JETI/SETI system configurations, potential TPTI requirements, and any other specific or pertinent information that would enhance the Navy’s understanding of the information submitted

With this information, the Navy will have an industry perspective on the latest technical architecture alternatives that will allow for a more informed technical feasibility alternatives assessment. 

HOW TO RESPOND

All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature as well as any comments or questions to Ms. Sarah Casto, e-mail: sarah.casto@navy.mil, fax: (732) 323-2359 or address: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts, Code 25212SC 562-3, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082.  All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST, 28 April 2009.  All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG), in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of sources to provide nationwide maintenance services for Local Area Networks (LANs), standalone personal computers, and related peripheral equipment located in the ten SSA Regions.  These regions consist of approximately 1,500 offices, including SSA Headquarters, located in Baltimore, Maryland; SSA Regional and Field Offices, located through the United States and its territories and protectorates; and State Disability Determination Services Offices.  

SSA requests information on maintenance service for Ethernet LANs using Microsoft Windows operating systems and IBM compatible Pentium 4 base processors.  Currently, there are approximately 80,000 LAN devices located throughout SSA’s LAN environment.  The LAN consists of workstations, file servers, tape backup, laser printers and remote and local bridges.  The system devices consist of network interface cards, modems, additional memory, network support devices, and other components.  Maintenance requirements include: 

• Remedial on-call maintenance for components, such as network devices, cable plant, and all other LAN devices attached or operating on the networks.  Remedial maintenance calls have a return-to-service window of close of business the next business day, or a six-hour return-to-service window for emergency calls; and 
• Preventive maintenance on laser printers performed on an as needed basis.  

SSA invites firms currently performing support consistent with these requirements to submit details of their capabilities.  Specifically, respondents must submit, at the minimum, the following information: 

1) Corporate experience, including socioeconomic and business size status;
2) Brief summary on the strategy you recommend to provide maintenance service on SSA’s nationwide LAN infrastructure;
3) Overall capabilities, with an emphasis on meeting performance levels, customer satisfaction, return-to-service times, equipment manufacturers supported, service areas, and manpower; 
4) Details on experience performing requirements of similar size and scope, particularly for Government customers where security procedures and access to sensitive/personally-identifiable information apply.  List no more than three past Government contracts/subcontracts similar in size and scope to SSA’s LAN maintenance requirement; and
5) Availability of services through existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (i.e. GSA Federal Supply Schedules, NASA SEWP, etc.).  Please include a copy of your GSA/GWAC schedule, if applicable.

Interested sources that believe they have the bona fide capability to perform these services should submit a detailed statement of their solution, in writing, to Christopher Mettee, Contract Specialist, Division of Information Technology and Maintenance, 7111 Security Boulevard, First Floor Rear Entrance, Baltimore, MD 21244.  SSA will accept responses submitted electronically via email at Christopher.Mettee@ssa.gov.  You may fax information to (410) 965-9486.  Please reference SSA-RFI-NWLM1 in the email subject line.  SSA must receive all responses by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 15, 2009.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking qualified concerns with specific and recent experience with Common Operational Picture (COP) Technology Refresh and creation of Decision Support Systems (DSS) that automate the capture, assessment and utility of multi-source data.  DHS is seeking the following:  (a) To determine if  the capabilities and supporting requirements described in this RFI are practical and complete; (2) To identify specific capabilities and supporting requirements that can only be addressed through customization of proven products or development of new technology; (3)  To identify the degree of risk associated with customization of proven products or development of new technology; (4) To Identify the methodologies and tools that can result in integrated solutions; (5) To Identify new data sources, analysis tools, and opportunities for collaboration that could enhance situational awareness and enable timely, risk mitigated, decision making across the entire Homeland Security Community. (6) To identify other information that would be useful to the mission owner or program manager. 

BACKGROUND:  The Homeland Security Presidential Directive – Five (HSPD-5) (February 2003) designated the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (SECDHS) as the “Principal Federal Official for Domestic Incident Management.” This role was expanded by Section 515 of the Post Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKEMRA) (October 2006) which directed the National Operation Center (NOC), as the principal operations center for the Department, to: (a) Provide situational awareness and a COP for the entire Federal Government, and for State, local, and tribal Governments as appropriate, in the event of a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster. (b) Ensure that critical terrorism and disaster-related information reaches Government decision-makers. Furthermore, the National Response Framework (December 2008), stated that the NOC: (a) Maintains the COP that provides overall situational awareness for incident information. (b) Is required to meet its information-fusion and information-sharing responsibilities by providing spot reports, situation reports, and other information–sharing tools, all supported by and distributed through its NOC COP. (c) Has a high priority to continue development and rapid integration of electronic reporting and information-sharing tools (at all levels) in support of the COP. 

CONSTRANTS: (1) The NOC COP and the NOC DSS are presented to the user through a single user interface (UI).  (a) The system will be available to users with low-tech equipment and limited bandwidth, such as mobile devices, slow internet connections and old computing platforms. (b) HSIN user authentication procedures and technology will be used to grant attribute-based access.  Therefore, different degrees of information will be available to different users. (2) The NOC COP and the NOC DSS will fully support Web 2.0 technologies.  (a) The system will use DHS enterprise services such as the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), HSIN Help Desk, the Integrated Common Analytical Viewer (iCAV) and DHS Earth.  There will be no duplication of capability. (b) The system will allow real-time changes to the UI without disruption in availability. (c) The system capabilities will be independent of the data feeds or analytical tools that certain users may employ. (3) The NOC requires a COP and DSS at the Unclassified, Secret and Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) levels. Although the host platform will be different, the UI will be nearly identical for each classification level. (4) The NOC COP visualization system will allow users to create a unique User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) on a single desktop or for dissemination on multiple panels as found in a typical operations center. An individual UDOP does not affect or copy back to the NOC COP. 

DESIRED SYSTEM CAPABILITIES: (1) AUTOMATE INFORMATION INGEST AND TRIAGE: (a) Tag, flag and extract information from asynchronous (unstructured) sources such as email. (b) Receive and filter information from pre-set discovery agents. (c) Automatically elevate information to the shared DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (d) Automatically push information to the NOC COP. (2) ASSESS DATA AND INFORMATION: (a) Integrate advanced analytical tools such as automated searches, modeling, text analytics, geospatial rendering, report generation, and data management services currently available in DHS and other products configured to meet NOC requirements. (b) Link to the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN where collaboration can occur.  (3) SEARCH FOR INFORMATION: (a) Enable a federated single query search using applications currently available in DHS and other products configured to meet NOC requirements. (b) Automatically search internal and external databases, documents and e-mail. (c) Run simple or complex queries of multiple databases by specifying attributes such as keywords, phrases, time periods, or locations. (d) Elevate information to the shared DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (4) FACILITATE COLLABORATION: (a) Use the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN to conduct collaborative work sessions with multiple participants. (b) View and access data elevated to the DHS NOC workspace on HSIN. (c) Allow users with appropriate privileges to view elevated information, attach commentary and observations, and insert new information. (5) ENABLE ACCESS TO HISTORICAL DATA:  (a) Store and retrieve all structured and unstructured information received by or created by the NOC.  Allow access to previous versions of documents. (b) Capture and store the actual NOC COP display and any collaborative work sessions for later review and analysis. (c) Perform extract-transform-load actions from old to new systems or formats. (6) VISUALIZE INFORMATION: (a) Allow for the automatic display of data and reports in the NOC COP in accordance with established business rules. (b) Allow users to create a unique UDOP on a single desktop or for dissemination on multiple panels as found in a typical operations center. An individual UDOP does not affect or copy back to the NOC COP.  (7) DISPLAY GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION: (a) Use DHS enterprise geospatial services including iCAV and DHS Earth.  There will be no duplication of capability. (b) Automatically or manually organize and depict layered information geospatially on map or other image.  (8) FACILITATE INTEROPERABILITY: (a) Allow the NOC to disseminate and distribute the NOC COP to the entire Homeland Security Community. (b) Encrypt data according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 guidelines. (c) Comply with all information assurance standards and security classification requirements. (d) Provide controls for authorized users to access information sources across all security classification levels/domains from Unclassified through TS/SCI.  Provide similar controls for user access to special types of information such as Proprietary Information, Personal Identification Information (PII), Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) Information, and US Persons Information.  (9) PROVIDE SECURITY:  (a) Grant attribute-based access so that different degrees of information will be available to different users. (b) Deploy a one-way-transfer mechanism to automate the movement of relevant information from unclassified to classified systems without having to manually transfer the material.  

MISSION SCENARIOS / USE CASES: (1) The NOC COP and DSS must enhance SA and facilitate timely, risk mitigated, decision making across the entire Homeland Security Community during every type of Homeland Security incident as represented by the Mission Scenarios/ Use Cases below. (2) Please consider the following mission scenarios / use cases when responding this RFI.    (a) SCENARIO #0 STEADY STATE:  All known incidents are below the level of national significance.

<DESC>The Rock Island Contracting Center (RICC) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey for potential sources to produce M67 Propelling Charge, NSN: 1315-01-237-9775, P/N: 9205472.  Estimated base quantity is 225,066 each plus two option quantities both estimated at 105% (236,319).  Respondents must demonstrate that they have the capability to handle propellants, which requires safe separation distances between buildings to prevent propagation in the event of an incident.  This also requires magazines to store energetic ingredients and finished product awaiting analyses or shipment. The propellant shall be supplied as Government Furnished Material (GFM).  Specialized skills/technologies are required to minimize hazards and environmental issues associated with energetic materials processing. Production assets required for artillery-propelling charges include explosion proof weigh scales and sewing machines.  A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have the technical capability, manufacturing capacity and positive past performance as indicators of existing qualifications.  Interested companies that have the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the following information:  1. Summary of Technical Capabilities; 2. Description of Facilities, Personnel, and Manufacturing Capabilities and Experiences and how they directly relate to the planned procurement; 3. Estimated Minimum and Maximum Monthly Production Capacities; and 4. Respondents shall state if they have made this item or similar items in the past.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria.  A TDP is not available for this announcement; however, one will be made available should a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) be released at a later date.  The Government anticipates that Best Value criteria would be used to evaluate and select the awardee of the anticipated contract for this requirement.  Responses to this survey shall be submitted electronically within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to HQ, Rock Island Contracting Center, ATTN: CCRC-AR/Stephanie Boozer at stephanie.boozer@us.army.mil.  All information collected from this market survey shall be used for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay respondents for information submitted.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.  Point of contact is Stephanie Boozer, Contract Specialist, stephanie.boozer@us.army.mil.<BR>

The ILPC is a smart power receptacle that can be used in lieu of a standard parking stall power outlet. It incorporates a microprocessor, temperature sensors and red/green LED lights to indicate the status of the system. It measures temperature and wind chill and is factory programmed to automatically regulate the optimum power flow to ensure strong starts at any temperature. The intelligent operation reduces electrical consumption costs by up to 65 percent. Each IPLC handles two outlets and each can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters or to meet the special needs of diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Red/green LEDs instantly indicate the status of the power outlet and user equipment including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open or short circuit in the block heater or a circuit overload from an in-car heater. Salient features of the product include: 1. Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature and wind chill factor. 2. Totally programmable via computer software to vary the amount of electricity supplied based on temperature. 3. Built-in microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with or without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor. 4. Identifies problems with open circuit or circuit overload via LEDs or other means. 5.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
The purpose of exchanging information (or RFI) is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential Offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award. 
The Marine Forces Reserve (MFR) Regional Contracting Office (RCO), New Orleans, LA is soliciting information from potential offerors to provide Oracle Software services to migrate an existing Marine Corps Enlisted Administration Separations System (MCEAS) system to another server from Kansas City, MO to New Orleans, LA with follow-on support services.
The MFR processes nearly one thousand three hundred enlisted involuntary administrative separations annually via MCEAS.  An administrative separation is a discharge from military service which requires flawless transactions that is time and personal information sensitive in accordance to directives, regulations and laws. MCEAS, implemented 1 September 2001, has provided a paperless method of submitting, tracking, and approving administrative separations over the past 8 years.  The operating platform, located in Kansas City, MO on the KCMA domain server needs to be analyzed to see its current operation and backup procedures, upgraded to the current version of Oracle and migrated to the MFR Virtual Machine (VM) server on the MFR Domain which is located in New Orleans, LA.  After this is complete, testing should be conducted prior to the system going into production in New Orleans.  After testing is completed and production begins a long term standing contract will be required ! to support the technical/programming needs of the system.  Service calls will need to be responded to and resolved within 24 hours of the phone call.
The MCEAS database is a web based application located in Kansas City, MO.  The software needs to be updated before the migration of the server takes place.  NMCI will not interfere with any maintenance required for the database or the integration itself.  All work will be done onsite.
Requesting from potential Offerors the best industry means to execute such a requirement in a cost effective and efficient manner.   Offerors shall be specialized in Oracle Forms and Reports in order to make the necessary changes.
If additional information is required please contact Dan Baker, Contracting Officer, at daniel.baker@usmc.mil.
No further information will be gathered after April 30, 2009.
An RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future, and a RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with OSIsoft, Inc, 777 Davis St, San Leandro, CA 94577-6923 the software publisher of PI Software.  The work to be performed under this requirement consists of upgrading the Yuma Area Office's High Availability PI System, Software Reliance Program, PI Analysis Framework, and PI Notifications.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government requests the purchase of OSIsoft's PI Notification and PI High Availability Server, which in turn requires the PI Analysis Framework and Software Reliance Program to compliment an in production PI solution utilized in the Yuma Area Office's desalinization distributed control SCADA system.  The requested OSIsoft PI products add additional critical functionality to the existing PI solution and ensure full product compatibility and support.  OSIsoft's PI software products are fully supported by OSIsoft in the Yuma Area Office's PI solution and are compatible with the current installation. Due to the sensitive nature of the system, full support from OSIsoft is necessary on all aspects of the solution and to the daily operations of the desalinization plant.
The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies that will satisfy the agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.   The Government intends to award this requirement on or about April 7, 2009, however all dates in this announcement are subject to change.  Firms that recognize and can provide the required work described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received before the anticipated award date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard of 500 employees under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 511210.  Responses to this notice should be mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisitions and Assistance Group (YAO-3100 Carrera), 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona 85364; via facsimile to 928-343-8568; or by E-mail at Jcarrera@usbr.gov.

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Lined Note Pad to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-09-03-30
<RESPDATE>041309
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Lined Note Pad by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7530-01-346-4849, Note Pad, lined, self-stick, yellow, 3"x5", 30% PCW, 100 sheets per pad, 12 pads per pack</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS OFC SUP CTR - PAPER PRODUCTS, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Lined Note Pad to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>MMM 635-YW</p>
<p>SPR 70401</p>
<p>SNR5X3YL</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Lined Note Pad to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 13, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and FAR Subparts 13.303, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals/quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The 319th Contracting Squadron at 575 Tuskegee Airman Blvd bldg 418, Grand Forks AFB, ND 58205 intends to establish a blanket purchase agreement for the services of Domestic Violence Offender Treatment Program. This solicitation is unrestricted and all responsible offers will be accepted. The solicitation number is FA4659-09-A-0014 and is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 and DFARS change notice 20080812. The NAICS code for the acquisition is 621420 and the size standard is $10 MIL. Offeror's must show: (1) The solicitation or reference number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) Price and discount terms; (5) Remit to address, if different than the mailing address; (6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendments, if any, for acceptance of offers. THE OFFEROR MUST AGREE TO HOLD THE PRICES SUBMITTED FOR THE SOLICITATION FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS. Discussions may not be held with offerors; therefore, each offerors initial quote should be complete and accurate. One award will be made based on which offer is fully in compliance with the performance work statement, and provides the best value to the government in terms of price. Prospective offers are due no later than 12:00 PM Central Time, 10 April 2009. <br /><br />The contractor shall provide the following: all tools, equipment, labor and materials to provide out-patient domestic violence treatment services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract and the statement of work. This is to be an out-patient program designed for domestic violence perpetrators using a psycho-educational approach that rests on the underlying assumption that domestic violence involves much more than physical violence by one partner against another. Domestic violence includes physical, psychological and sexual abuse with the need for power and control at the root of all types of abuse perpetrated. The program needs to be designed to help the perpetrator confront their attitudes about control, teach them other strategies for dealing with their partners, identify and practice non-abusive behavior, explore the impact of violent and abusive behaviors on partners, children and group members and encourage the perpetrator to take full responsibility for abuse behavior and challenge their denial of the abuse. The Contractor shall establish a 29-session program involving an individual intake interview, 27 group sessions, and an individual exit interview. The group sessions are to occur once per week for two hours. Activities and key topics should be designed to increase knowledge and change attitudes and behaviors. All activities will be geared to help batterers accept responsibility for their actions, learn what abusive choices are and why they are not acceptable, and learn how to make respectful choices within their relationships. The safety of participants' intimate partners is to be addressed in each stage of assessment and during a period of group treatment. <br /><br />The following provisions and clauses can be viewed through Internet access at the Air Force FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. In Accordance with FAR 52.252-1 and FAR 52.252-2, the following provisions and clauses are incorporated by reference or by full text FAR 52.202-1, Definitions; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

(a)	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor’s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI.

	(2)	Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or
	(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:
		(i)	Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and

(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
	(5)	If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

SPECIAL BUSINESS QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS

The Government anticipates that the work will be performed at the contractor’s facility.  
52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intneds to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on how it proposes to provide the printing services required.  The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPM’s operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

•	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports - and technical excellence.

•	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

•	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

•	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Government’s interests. 

•	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractor’s services. 

Assessment of offeror’s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 
3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.
	
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Reference number is W912HQ-09- T-0012 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-31. This solicitation is a 100 percent set aside for small business; the associated NAICS code is 541628 and small business size standard is $7M.<BR><BR>Scope of Work<BR><BR>Project Management and Coordination for the<BR>Ecosystem Technical Work Group of the International Upper Great Lakes Study<BR><BR>I. Background:<BR><BR>The International Upper Great Lakes Study Board (Study Board) is about to enter the third year of a five-year study for the International Joint Commission (IJC). The objectives of the study are to:<BR><BR>"	examine the physical processes and possible ongoing St. Clair River changes and their  impacts on levels of Lake Michigan and Huron;<BR>"	recommend and evaluate potential remedial options depending on the nature and extent of St. Clair River changes and impacts;<BR>"	review the operation of structures controlling Lake Superior outflow and the potential effects on water levels and flows and the potential impacts on users;<BR>"	assess whether changes to the IJCs Lake Superior Orders of Approval or regulation plan are warranted to meet contemporary and emerging needs, interests and preferences for managing the system in a sustainable manner; and<BR>"	evaluate any options to improve the operating rules and criteria governing the upper Great Lakes system.<BR><BR>The Study Board will make decisions that will affect the Upper Great Lakes for decades.  Those decisions will be based on the Study Boards estimate of the impacts of various lake level regulation alternatives, and those estimates in turn will be based on assumptions about the impact areas each Technical Working Group represents; the environment, commercial navigation, hydropower, shoreline development, recreational boating, and domestic, municipal and industrial water use.<BR><BR>II. Outline:<BR><BR>The Ecosystem Technical Work Group (ETWG) is tasked with informing the Study Boards discussions and estimates on the impacts from various lake level regulation alternatives, specifically with respect to potential ecological impacts. In order to assess these potential impacts in an informed way, the ETWG must gather information and appropriate data from multiple sources to support an evaluation of environmental responses to alternative water-level regulation scenarios. However, time constraints will limit data collection efforts to one and a half field seasons and as a result; the ETWG will be pursuing a series of parallel data collection efforts at multiple sites over a relatively short period of time. <BR><BR>III. Objectives:<BR><BR>To ensure appropriate information and data are collected and evaluated efficiently, the ETWG requires a project manager to coordinate the activities and manage the flow of information and data between the ETWGs modeling group, GIS group, and site coordinators.  The project manager will act as a liaison between the ETWG modeling contractor(s), site coordinators, and with other Technical Working Groups (TWGs).  These services are to be performed on a part-time basis throughout 2009, but at varying levels of activity (i.e., some weeks will be full-time).<BR><BR>Given the complexity of issues at hand, it is the responsibility of the project manager to ensure appropriate linkages are made and that project synergies are maximized.  The ETWG requires a contractor that is already an expert in Great Lakes issues; has proven experience with data gathering approaches, including field studies; has a strong knowledge of the Upper Great Lakes Study; and understands the roles and responsibilities of the ETWG and the objectives of its data collection efforts. Preference will also be given to a contractor with demonstrated communication abilities, familiarity with software and modeling applications, and the ability to transfer large files using FTP protocols.<BR><BR>IV. Tasks:<BR><BR>The contractor (project manager) will provide multiple services throughout 2009:<BR><BR>"	Develop project timeline with key milestones and target dates<BR>"	Collect additional data/information sources and input from participants at ETWGs Experts Workshop (held February 3-4, 2009);<BR>"	Coordinate the development of metrics for performance indicators;<BR>"	Document and confirm selection criteria for study areas/sample sites;<BR>"	Develop documentation on the strategy for study approach for Peer Review;<BR>"	Coordinate the development of interest satisfaction curves;<BR>"	Serve as intermediary between the ETWGs modeling group, GIS group, and site coordinators; and<BR>"	Engage and coordinate with other relevant TWGs (e.g., Coastal Zone TWG) and work groups in their data gathering and modeling efforts.<BR><BR>V. Period of Performance:<BR><BR>TASK 1: Develop project timeline with key milestones and target dates  DUE - 15 Days After NTP<BR><BR>TASK 2: Collect additional data/information sources and input from participants at ETWGs Experts Workshop  DUE 30 Days After NTP <BR><BR>TASK 3:  Coordinate development of metrics for performance indicators  DUE - 30 days after Modeling workshop<BR><BR>TASK 4: Document/confirm selection criteria for study areas/sample sites  DUE - 30 days after Modeling workshop<BR><BR>TASK 5:  Develop documentation on the Study Approach for Peer Review  DUE -  July 1, 2009<BR><BR>TASK 6: Coordinate development of interest satisfaction curves  DUE  - November 6, <BR>2009<BR><BR>CLIN 0001,                1 LUMP SUM                         $___________________<BR>Description:  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and supervision necessary to provide services in accordance with the statement of work.  <BR><BR>CLIN 0002              	COST					$___________________<BR>Description:	In accordance with FAR 31.205-46, travel costs, if applicable, shall be reimbursed at rates not to exceed the maximum locality per diem (the combination of lodging, meals, and incidentals) in effect at the time of travel, as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations, Joint Travel Regulation and Standard Regulations, Section 925, as applicable.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

2.  ISSUANCE DATE: March 30, 2009

3.  CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: April 13, 2009, 5:00 pm EDT

4.  POSITION TITLE: Program Assistant / Program Manager

5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a “tandem/ladder” position.  The highest level of this position is a GS-12; however, USAID intends to fill this position at the GS-9 or GS-11 equivalent level.  The entry level for this position has been established at either the GS-9 level (Salary range: $50,408 - $65,531 per year) or the GS-11 level (Salary range: $60,989 – $79,280 per year).  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-9 or GS-11 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.  

The title of the position at the GS-9 level will be “Program Assistant”.  Following at least one (1) year at the GS-9 equivalent grade the candidate may have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-11 equivalent grade.  To be eligible for promotion to the GS-11 level, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications of the GS-11 grade, and receive an “Excellent” performance rating in the annual performance evaluation.  The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

The title of the position at the GS-11 level will be “Program Manager”.  Following one (1) year at the GS-11 equivalent grade the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-12 equivalent grade.  To be eligible for promotion to the GS-12 level, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 grade, and receive an “Excellent” performance rating in the annual performance evaluation.  The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-9 and GS-11 positions carefully.  Applicants may submit for more than one position/grade level (only at the GS-9 or GS-11 levels), but must submit a separate application for each position.  No applications will be accepted for the GS-12 level.  Applicants must be cautious:  those who submit an application for the GS-11 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-9 position unless they submitted a complete separate application for the GS-9 grade level and meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-9 position as reviewed by the TEC.  On the other hand, applicants who apply for only the GS-9 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-11 position will not be considered for the GS-11 position unless they also apply for that position.

6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  2 years, renewable up to 5 years

7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

The OTI Program Assistant / Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI’s Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC.

OTI’s Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  

The Program Assistant / Program Manager’s principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI’s regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises.  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.

When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

SPECIAL BUSINESS QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS

The Government anticipates that the work will be performed at the contractor’s facility.  
52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intneds to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on how it proposes to provide the printing services required.  The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPM’s operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

•	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports - and technical excellence.

•	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

•	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

•	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Government’s interests. 

•	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractor’s services. 

Assessment of offeror’s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 
3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.
	
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

These are; Body Adaptive Control combines a weigh-sensing synchronized tilt mechanism with a povoting back; Synchoronized tilt motion with seat lift; Independent pivoting back that moves separately from the seat back tilt; Quick Tension lever, 5 positions, adjusts tension without having to reach under the seat or by twisting knobs, Back lock or recline adjustment; Height-Adjustable lumber support, adjust back tension for the lumbar without using hard pads against the spine; Pneumatic Seat height adjustment offered in both a 5" and 3" cylinder range to meet BIFMA G1-2002 solutions for VDT users; Seat Depth Adjustment allows for a 3" range of adjustment front to back. Adjustable arms provide height, width, and depth adjustability; Seat back comes in mesh or upholstered options, and in a high and mid back version; Seating line offers matching side chairs and stools. The Allsteel Relate chair provides a superior ergonomic seating option as the flexibility of this chair improves pressure distribution, superior back support, improves mental focus, productivity while reducing neck and eye strain. The adaptive pivoting motion provides continuous back support while encouraging movement. Movement while sitting reduces fatigue and keeps discs healthy. Adjustment levelers are easy to reach to encourage adjustment through out the day to provide custom support for different tasks. This also encourages the users to adjust the seating as different people us the same chair and not set in a miss adjusted chair.<BR><BR>

The Nucleofector™ concept uses a unique combination of electrical parameters and cell-type specific Nucleofector™ solutions. Based on this combination, the Nucleofector™ Technology is the first efficient routine method for non-viral gene transfer into primary cells and hard-to-transfect cell lines. In addition, the Nucleofector™ Technology to date is unique in its ability to transfer DNA directly into the cell nucleus. The Nucleofector™ technology thus enables gene transfer into highly relevant cell types, often with unprecedented efficiencies.




The transfection process is a manual process in most instances with very low efficiency. Some automated processes are offered, but are not designed for high throughput.
The technology that we seek should be able to accommodate our studies in the providing the following:
1.	The ability to transfer biologically active molecules (e.g.DNA, RNA, proteins of varying size) into the cytoplasm and into the nucleus of primary cells and cell lines without significant cell toxicity.
2.	The ability to transfect non-dividing cells, such as neurons and resting blood cells.
3.	High throughput transfection of single and multiple samples. 
4.	The instrument must have a  single cuvette component, a 96-well format component, a laptop, including user friendly software interfaced with the system.
5.	A 96 well independent format, with each well being pulsed and treated as an independent sample, thus giving the capacity to process 96 different conditions across the plate. 
6.	The capacity to transfer non-viral genes into primary cells and cell lines that are hard to transfect.
7.	Transfected cells must be ready for analysis in 2-6hrs.
8.	Machine must be able to provide very high efficiencies. Up to 95% transfection efficiency with DNA combined with viabilities greater than 95% and up to 99% siRNA duplex transfer in suspension cells.
9.	Software interfaced with the system must be user friendly and provide protocols that are cell-type specific.
10.	Reagents and components for use with the system must be cost efficient.

DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.

Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government! . 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price fo! r reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism and balance of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts a! nd the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the offeror's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not conside! r the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide inf! ormation about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Offerors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-c! ompliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the
authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and
capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of
intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals
received within thirty days after date of publication of this
synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the
Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses
to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)  When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by --

     (ii) For DOD, NASA, and the Cost Gaurd, Unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.


DFAR 206.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(a) Authority.

(2)(i) Section 8059 of Pub. L. 101-511 and similar sections in subsequent defense appropriations acts, prohibit departments and agencies from entering into contracts for studies, analyses, or consulting services (see FAR Subpart 37.2) on the basis of an unsolicited proposal without providing for full and open competition, unless—
     (1) The head of the contracting activity, or a designee no lower than chief of the contracting office, determines that—

          (i) Following thorough technical evaluation, only one source is fully qualified to perform the proposed work;

AFFAR IG 5306


 ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE (OR LIMITED NUMBER)

Guidance regarding use of this authority is at FAR 6.302-1. It applies when either the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, when one or a limited number of responsible sources can satisfy agency requirements. Solicitations for other than full and open competition will not be released until the J&A has been approved when proceeding under this authority.

When Appropriate:

This authority is appropriate when impediments to full and open competition are known to exist, even though there may be more than one potential source. It is normally used for follow-on acquisitions when only specified sources are capable of performing the effort due to their involvement in earlier phases or contracts. The key to distinguishing a limited competition from a full and open competition is the type of information provided in or with the solicitation. If the offerors must possess additional information from previous efforts under the program in order to perform the proposed contract and the government is unable to provide this information, the competition is not full and open. This does not mean that the information must be so detailed that even Joe’s Garage could build a radar system. Potential competitors must have appropriate financial and technical resources (or the ability to obtain them) and the technical experience and organizational controls needed to accomplish the work within the required or proposed delivery schedule. The use of this exception may be appropriate under the following conditions:

       7. There is other reasonable basis to conclude that the government’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities (see FAR 6.302-l(b)(l)).


The minimum requirement is for this Flight Simulator Training, in all models of the C-130 Aircraft (A-H).  This training must meet these minimum requirements to be considered acceptable:

     1.  Flight training must be in a full motion (6-degrees of Freedom) simulator that can be configured for all models A-H

     2.  Flight training must include a full scale VAST simulator copit of the C-130 aircraft for simultanious training of the cockpit aircrew.

     3.  Flight training must also include classroom and computer simulation to include basic aircraft operations, general avaiation guidlines.

     4.  Flight training is to support several Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Customers as well as US Military and Government Students.

     5.  The supplier must have un-restricted access to the full motion simulator in order to support changing schedules of FMS students and have the ability to conduct the abouve training requirements simultaneously to support several students in different stages.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.

You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD), and 07-016 (VA)) in order to be considered for lease award.  REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the “Register to offer space” link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 14th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY: Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the fall of 2008.  DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-014 must be located in Washington, DC; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-015 must be located in Suburban Maryland; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-016 must be located in Northern Virginia.
