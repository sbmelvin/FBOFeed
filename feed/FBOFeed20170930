PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Both the selected contractor s facility and the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center (WJBD VAMC), 6439 Garners Ferry Road, Columbia, SC 29209. 

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  

Currently we have 7,642 cubic feet of old Veteran/patient medical and administrative record stored by a contractor at a fully approved NARA facility.  These records are from the VA Medical Center in Columbia and the Greenville Outpatient Center. We also have approximately 200 boxes (200 cubic feet) of records on site at the VA Medical Center that will also need to be stored. The current contract will expire and a new contract will be needed to store these records.  The contractor s facility will need to be a fully certified NARA facility.
The currently stored records will need to be retrieved from the current storage facility and the 200 boxes that are on site at the Medical Center will need to be picked up.  All records will be logged into some type of data system (preferable system would be Bar Coding) for easy retrieval by Dorn employees and the contractor.  That data system should be able to show what types of records are being stored (Medical, Administrative, Fee, Dental, etc.) and how many volumes of each (Medical 1, 2, 3 etc.) The contractor will have a secure web site that we can use to request records for needs of the Veteran/patient, Release of Information, and Veterans Benefits Administration.  The contractor will provide secure mailing of the records, per our request, of records as listed in VA Directive 6609. The contractor will also furnish a CD of these listing the records in their data system.



Dorn VAMC will provide the following:  The area for the approximately 200 boxes of records to be loaded for pickup.  

Contractor will provide:  

A NARA certified storage facility for retired records;
Shipment of records from the current contractor s facility to the new facility;
Shipment of the records still at the VAMC Columbia to the contractor s facility;
A secure web site to order records, a data system to log in/out these records and the type/volume of records, and secure mailing of requested records.  
After all records are logged into contractor s facility a CD shall be provided of all records stored.

The following paragraphs are from VA Directive 6609 and define the  securely mailed  under 5b and 7.

Mail containing information under VA control must be shipped via the most secure, economical, and effective means practicable. VA requires the protection of SPI during the mailing process. As such, special procedures must be used for its protection. Mail, including both hardcopy and electronic media, that is lost, sent to the wrong recipient, or stolen can result in identity theft. Identity theft may result in personal hardship to individuals, including Veterans, dependents, and VA personnel. In order to ensure the adequate protection of mailing both within and from VA, the following procedures will be implemented Department-wide: 

a. Risk Analysis: Pursuant to the results of a risk analysis, a sender may provide additional security protections for categories of mail based upon its format and content. The risk analysis should be performed in consultation with the appropriate Privacy Officer, and if the mailing is in electronic form, the appropriate Information Security Officer should be included. If the risk analysis dictates, the media may be shipped via a delivery service that exceeds the minimum security requirements set forth in this Directive. The cost of any associated and additional services and will be the responsibility of the sender. If the purchase of containers is identified as a necessary security solution, all responsibilities associated with the custody of these containers will be the sender s responsibility.
 
d. Use of Secure Delivery and Package Tracking: Original documents, as defined in Paragraph 5b of this policy, must be sent via a secure delivery service that tracks mail from pick-up to delivery. Examples of services that provide this type of online tracking system are FedEx InSight, UPS Ground, and United States Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail. 

b. Original Document   The best evidence of the contents of a document is the original of that document. For purposes of this directive, the term refers to the originals of documents used for evidentiary purposes which, if lost or destroyed, would be difficult or impossible to replace. Examples include service, medical or personnel records, marriage certificates, birth certificates, passports, and diplomas. A VA claims folder is an original document, even if it only contains copies. 

CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MONITORING:  The government reserves the right to monitor services in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Up to four firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $15,000,000.00. Up to four contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated. These contracts will be for a period of performance of up to five (5) years, consisting of a base contract period of three (3) years and an option to extend the contract term by an additional two (2) years. This MATOC will have a combined capacity of $35,000,000.00. The full $35,000,000.00 will be available for the base year and any remaining funds will carry over once the option years are exercised. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.1) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employee's office location (not the location of the work). If a large business firm is selected for one of these contracts, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date. A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330. If a large business is selected it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract. Sacramento District's recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 41.5% for small business. The goal further states that of the 40.08% to be subcontracted to small business, 21.69% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.33% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 5.58% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business), 3.0% for veteran-owned small business and 4.97% is for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (subset to small business). If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met. Firms should indicate personnel and subcontracts selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Task orders under this contract may include A-E services that provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. <br /><br />Civil Works project studies and designs could involve levees, floodwalls, dams, spillways, pumping stations, various mechanical gate structures, stilling basins, hydraulic flow control structures, bridges, buildings, infrastructure (road and utility) systems, operations and maintenance manuals, dam safety risk analyses, and flood damage reduction project/system risk based analysis.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC><strong>PLEASE SEE THE HIGHLIGHTED LINES BELOW FOR ANY CHANGES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE DUE DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL WEDNESDAY 25 MAY 2016.</strong> <br /><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Up to four firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $15,000,000.00. Up to four contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated. These contracts will be for a period of performance of up to five (5) years, consisting of a base contract period of three (3) years and an option to extend the contract term by an additional two (2) years. This MATOC will have a combined capacity of $35,000,000.00. The full $35,000,000.00 will be available for the base year and any remaining funds will carry over once the option years are exercised. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.1) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employee's office location (not the location of the work). If a large business firm is selected for one of these contracts, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date. A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330. If a large business is selected it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract. Sacramento District's recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 41.5% for small business. The goal further states that of the 40.08% to be subcontracted to small business, 21.69% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.33% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 5.58% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business), 3.0% for veteran-owned small business and 4.97% is for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (subset to small business). If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met. Firms should indicate personnel and subcontracts selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Task orders under this contract may include A-E services that provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. <br /><br />Civil Works project studies and designs could involve levees, floodwalls, dams, spillways, pumping stations, various mechanical gate structures, stilling basins, hydraulic flow control structures, bridges, buildings, infrastructure (road and utility) systems, operations and maintenance manuals, dam safety risk analyses, and flood damage reduction project/system risk based analysis.</p>
