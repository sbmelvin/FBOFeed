<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Modification to Contract with Development Alternatives Inc.
<DESC>USAID/Jordan intends to award a sole source modification to Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) under award no.  278-C-00-06-00329-00.  The estimated amount of this modification is approximately $116,300.

The above contract was awarded to DAI on a Full & Open Competition basis on March 28, 2007 for 4 years at a total amount of $8,863,437.00.  The purpose of this contract is to initiate sustainable water demand management in Jordan by establishing and strengthening an institutional and regulatory framework.  This requires building the institutional capacity for water demand management in the involved institutions, developing and supporting enforcement of laws and regulations for efficient water use, and to demonstrate selected water demand management initiatives to the public.

USAID wishes to Develop Best Management Practices Guide for High-Rise Buildings and High-Density Residential Development and draft a report that recommends to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation the specifications on water that need to be incorporated into a potential High-Rise Building Code. 

The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract.  Seeking new procurement to fulfill those expanded services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming.  This non-competitive modification is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b) (2).  Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals.  All statements of interest received within 15 days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  However, a determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract action based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
