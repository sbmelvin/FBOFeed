This program is aimed primarily to support USAID/Afghanistan’s Infrastructure Objective to create a thriving economy led by the private sector.

The objective of this program is to provide USAID/Afghanistan a full range of technical assistance and physical support to assist the Government of Afghanistan (GoA), Afghan people, and private sector to achieve objectives that mesh with and will contribute to the achievement of four infrastructure sector objectives –   Energy and Natural Resources, Transportation, Public Buildings, and Urban Development/Water & Sanitation.  Work in all sectors will include three main components:

1)	technical assistance in the four sectors for institutional development and capacity building, including  policy formulation, planning, studies, training and operation and maintenance; 

2)	engineering, including design, reconstruction and construction of infrastructure systems and facilities; and,

3)	provision of equipment and commodities to support the operations, as well as infrastructure-related equipment and materials.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935.  As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries.  The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows:  Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR.  USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award with a period of performance for 5 years at a total estimated ceiling of up to $1.4 Billion.  The RFP is expected to be issued on November 14, 2005 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  It will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-03
UNMANNED AND UNATTENDED UNDERWATER SURVEILLANCE (UUUS)

BAA CLOSING DATE: One year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov; FULL PROPOSALS FOR INITIAL SELECTIONS DUE: 1200 noon EST on 21 December 2005.  POC: Dr. Edward Carapezza, DARPA/ATO, 3701 Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714; Email: BAA06-03@darpa.mil; Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/UUUS/index.htm.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and demonstration to support the Unmanned and Unattended Underwater Surveillance program.  The UUUS objective is to develop enabling technologies and integrate said technologies into systems for unmanned and unattended underwater surveillance of littoral and fresh water (lake and river) areas with a distributed set of both stationary and mobile assets, via a phased, multiyear program.

Pursuant to the program objectives, this BAA solicits proposals that include (but are not limited to) the following technology areas: Miniature low-power underwater sensors and MEMs (acoustic, magnetic, turbulence, e-field, imaging, chemical, and biological); Multi-phenomenological sensors; Multi-sensor fusion and situation awareness algorithms; Real-time and distributed control systems, including intelligent planning algorithms; Fixed and mobile surveillance sensors to enable underwater communications, tagging, and geopositioning; Micro pumping and sampling systems to acquire and move chemical and biological materials; Electronic sensors and devices to non-intrusively monitor the state and health of divers and marine mammals; and Electronic sensors and devices to monitor key ocean and freshwater environmental parameters, such as ambient temperature, pressure, salinity, and biological emissions.  Details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria are provided in a classified addendum to this BAA.

This BAA affords offerors the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Procurement Contract, Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Technology Investment Agreement, or Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.

Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following criteria, in descending order of importance: 1) Technical approach, 2) Management approach, 3) Potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission, 4) Relevant experience in developing military systems, and 5) Cost reasonableness and realism.  Since no common work statement exists, each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates to the program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

This BAA shall remain open through one year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov.  Although the Government may receive responses at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  In order to be considered for initial selections, full proposals must be received by the Government no later than 1200 noon on 21 December 2005.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Also the Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 05-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

A TOP SECRET facility clearance AND a TOP SECRET safeguarding clearance is required to perform under this BAA (beyond the Proposers’ Day).  Organizations that do not have BOTH of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does. 

For additional information on the UUUS program, reference the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) and DD Form 254 “Contract Security Classification Specification”.  Additional details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria are provided in a classified addendum to the associated program BAA.  To receive the classified addendum, your organization's CAGE code must list both the facility and safeguarding clearances, as a minimum, at the SECRET level.  Proposers are advised to email their Facility Security Officer’s (FSO) name, phone number, secure fax number, and classified registry mailing address, and CAGE code to Eugene.McGoldrick@darpa.mil as soon as possible, in order to receive the classified addendum in time to prepare their proposal accordingly.  The classified addendum will be sent ONLY to each organization's FSO.

NOTE: DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. ALL INQUIRIES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO BAA06-03@darpa.mil.

This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis.  Solicitation Documents will be uploaded within 7 days after posting date of this notice.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror(s) that offers the best value for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's minimum technical requirements.  Multiple Awards may be made.  Supplier technical responses and initial price proposals will be due no later than 2:00 p.m. on May 5, 2005 at the address specified in the solicitation.  Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, will submit final pricing via GSA's Reverse Auction Website, and will be notified separately when the opportunity arises.  A pre-proposal conference is planned and the time and date will be announced in the solicitation, and posted to FedBizOps.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis, however the successful offeror will be required to be registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) as a Retail Electric Provider (REP).

<DESC>APPLICATION SUPPORT CENTERS (ASC) Operations and Facilities Services.  The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (DHS/USCIS) has a requirement to operate, lease, and maintain facilities for the Application Support Center Program.  Requirements include biometrics collection, mobile route operations, application collection, local scheduling, facilities leasing/ maintenance, special projects, and project/administrative support to process USCIS customers seeking immigration benefits.  Currently, biometrics capture and other services for approximately 3.5 million applicants are performed at 136 government or contractor-leased ASCs through the USA and its territories.  The prime vendor must assume all leases for contractor-leased space (currently 81 leases), and may be required to obtain leases for and operate a new domestic scheduling center and potentially overseas sites.  DHS anticipates significant ASC organizational and process changes during the life of the contract to meet future workload and homeland security issues.  Sites may be added, moved, or deleted as needs change.  Significant workload lulls and surges are expected.  All contractor staff must be U.S. citizens and must be able to obtain a T-2 (mid-risk) or T-1 (high-Risk) clearance.  Labor categories will vary by site and may consist of site supervisors, quality assurance specialists, quality assurance processors, biometrics technicians, unarmed guards, armed guards, schedulers, and other labor categories that cover the work listed above.

The projected date for issuance of the solicitation is within the first week of November 2005. 

USCIS encourages the use of teaming arrangements or mentor/protege agreements in this acquisition, however, mentor/protege agreements must be approved by DHS prior to proposal submission.  

The RFP will be issued on an unrestricted basis (full & open competition).  The Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract period of performance will be for a base year and four one-year option periods.

A reference library CD will be available to all potential offerors after the RFP has been posted.  To request this reference library CD, potential offerors shall forward their request by email to kristie.nestle @dhs.gov and ned.ross@dhs.gov.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Secretaría de Desarrollo Urbano y Obras Públicas (SEDURBECOP).

SEDURBECOP is responsible for all the activities related to public works, human urban development and environmental topics, including human settlements and housing. They have requested a study to help evaluate the feasibility of expanding and rehabilitating the water supply, wastewater and drainage management infrastructure in the Lake Valsequillo watershed area in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The objective of the Project is to reverse the current process of ecological degradation that is occurring throughout the watershed and promote the potential for economic development as a result of improved conditions.

The Feasibility Study would include the following three general work items: an assessment of existing and necessary infrastructure, including sewer systems, water and wastewater treatment plants, and potable water networks; a comprehensive plan for the clean-up of Lake Valsequillo and a plan to improve the efficiency of the organizations that operate the water sector systems. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $797,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their one (1) English original and a copy and one (1) Spanish original and six (6) Spanish copies directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m. on November 30, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Section 1: Executive Summary; Section 2: Innovative Claims; Section 3: Technical Approach (including: Description of CASE area(s) addressed, Scenario that illustrates expected use or impact, Performance Evaluation, Proposed Data Sources, and Deliverables); Section 4: Key Personnel & Related Experience.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 6 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07; FY09 by 1 Oct 08; and FY10 by 1 Oct 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 May 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  Submission of white papers will be regulated in accordance with FAR 15.208.

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: D. Daskiewich, IFED and reference BAA-06-02-IFKA.  Electronic submission to Daniel.Daskiewich@rl.af.mil is strongly preferred, or white papers on CD can be addressed to AFRL/IFED (D.

Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA-06-02-IFKA.

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Openness of Solution and Technology Evaluation  - including plans for participation with the evaluation and integration team (see http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFE/CASE_info.html for additional information), (3) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge.   Consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA , and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  ARDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.


VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.

It should be noted that CASE is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level.  Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level.  While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.

3.  REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.     Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VIII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below (Email submissions preferred):

    Daniel Daskiewich
    Telephone:  (315) 330-7731

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to the requirement.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use the information received to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy future requirements, as it is the Government’s intent to compete any follow-on actions at the end of the period of performance (POP) for the proposed contract action.  It is anticipated the POP will be for one base year plus one option year.

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) and Ernst & Young (E&Y) are excited to announce the Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB) Housing Privatization Project Request for Proposal (RFP) is to be released on or about 14 November 2005 via Ernst & Young’s housing privatization Web site: http://www.eypsc.com/.  Proposals will be due 60 days after the release of the RFP.

Tinker AFB, located in Oklahoma City, OK, is seeking to privatize its military family housing.  The Government will lease approximately 225 acres of on-base land for 50 years and convey 694 existing housing units and other improvements to a private developer.  The developer will finance, plan, design, renovate, and construct the housing.  Specifically, the project scope calls for 432 units to be demolished and replaced, 36 units will be newly constructed, 54 will be renovated, and 208 require no improvements, for an end state of 730 units.

The TAFB Project will employ a one-step solicitation approach.  The proposal submittal requirements, which are identified in the RFP, include submitting three volumes of information: 1) the project proposal (financial, development, and property management information), 2) the offeror’s qualifications, and 3) past performance information.  The Government seeks to award to the Highest Ranked Offeror (HRO) whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The Government will then enter into exclusive negotiations with the HRO.  

If you require a site visit before submitting your proposal, please contact Carol Hill at 405-734-7213 or Carol.Hill@tinker.af.mil in order to schedule a date and time.

Please visit www.eypsc.com to download the Statement of Needs and other information on the TAFB Project.  The Statement of Needs provides all the essential information that will be contained in the final official version of the RFP (to be released on or about 14 November 2005).  If you have questions regarding the TAFB Project, please contact Kim Marchand at KimMarchand@emaxllc.com or at 202-449-7722.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power supply to various Federal facilities, located in the deregulated markets, in the State of Texas.  The successful offeror will supply electricity and transmission for various contract terms of twelve (12) to sixty (60) monthly billing cycles generally beginning with the next available meter read after contract award.  The approximate one (1) year electric requirement is 133 million kilowatt hours (KWh).  The Government intends to have pricing groups that request flat, firm fixed pricing for generic power, with and without a "renewable energy" feature (5, 10 and 15% renewable energy proposals).  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR.  This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis.  Solicitation Documents will be uploaded within 7 days after posting date of this notice.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror(s) that offers the best value for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's minimum technical requirements.  Multiple Awards may be made.  Supplier technical responses and initial price proposals will be due no later than 2:00 p.m. on May 5, 2005, at the address specified in the solicitation.  Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, will submit final pricing via GSA's Reverse Auction Website, and will be notified separately when the opportunity arises.  A pre-proposal conference is planned and the time and date will be announced in the solicitation, and posted to FedBizOps.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis, however the successful offeror will be required to be registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) as a Retail Electric Provider (REP).  Any questions or requests for additional information should be directed in writing to Mr. Mark Brady, Contracting Officer, at mark.brady@gsa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  What are the specifications concerning the surface potential measurement requirement? Answer:  The EPA's  interests lie in the need to determine the surface charge of surfaces and see how the charge varies across a  surface.  The surface charge of a corroding metal, for example, is controlled by surface functional groups on the corrosion deposits that form and understanding how the charge changes across a surface might indicate differences in chemical composition.  The surface charge also plays an important  role in controlling the tendency of the surface to adsorb ions, and the attraction of colloids and attachment of bacteria to the surface.  Experiments designed to see how water chemistry changes the surface charge of metal surfaces, for example and other materials are planned.   Amendment  #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred simultaneous display of topography  image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:  Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an example of an application:  The EPA looks  at metal corrosion products frequently and is interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA may also be interested to know whether the  materials are reactive with certain other materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use appropriate modified tips to answer the  questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.  Basically, the EPA is looking for the capability of measuring both  height and amplitude for a comparison of the area between the two images.   The Last day for Technical Questions is Thursday November 02, 2005.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with  additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334513.  The specifications for the Atomic Force Microscope are as follows: 1.0	Atomic Force Microscope  Specifications and Requirements The atomic force microscope must be capable of providing the following features to meet the required needs of the EPA's experimental research projects: "	Capable of providing the following scanning capabilities: electric force microscopy, magnetic force microscopy,  conductive atomic force microscopy, surface potential microscopy. "	Capable of providing shear force, sample compression, and stick-slip motion for high resolution, true surface measurements (e.g. tapping mode AFM operation or operation mode with like capabilities). "	Capable of performing AFM  imaging in a closed fluid cell. (This is a key and necessary feature that will allow evaluation of surfaces while in an aqueous environment). "	Capable of  providing active, real-time scan linearization "	Capable of providing multiple pass topography scanning, which allows for direct separation of  topographic data from amplitude, phase, or frequency detection data. "	Capable of providing a vibration control table. (This is a necessary feature for this purchase order, as the EPA facility is known to have vibration issues).  "	Capable of providing enhanced sensitivity capabilities, i.e.  ability to provide surface information at nanoscale accuracy.  "	Capable of providing rapid scan time. "	Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography).

<DESC>Bulk fuel requirement for DF2 and MUM for Camp Cedar II, Iraq.
Diesel Fuel #2 (DF2), 83,950,000 USG (230,000 USG/ day), NSN: 9140-00-286-5294; and Gasoline, Auto, Regular, 87 Auto (MUR), 18,250,000 USG (50,000 USG/day), NSN: 9130-01-272-0983.  Delivery Period is from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 plus a single six-month option period running from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007.  Option period quantity is 41,630,000 USG (230,000 USG/day) for DF2 and 9,050,000 USG (50,000 USG/day) for MUR.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, this requirement has been re-identified for non-competitive contract action.  Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is deemed to be the only source capable of supplying the requirement.  Initially this was believed to be the case, but in the absence of any definitive evidence preventing the occurrence of competition, the notice was revised to open the solicitation to other interested parties.  Recently however, KPC has formally expressed that it is its sales policy to contract directly with end-users and not through third parties and that it would not be providing product or access to its facilities to any third party intending to supply DESC under this tender.  As KPC owns/controls the only facilities necessary for providing the requirement, it is not possible for any third party to tender a responsible offer.  Thus it is DESC’s intent to enter into a contractual arrangement with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC).

Other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 31 October 2005 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement (Note #22).Proposals are to be directed to the DESC Bid Custodian before the closing date and time to facsimile 703-767-0488.E-mail offers will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>V -- Source Sought for Fuel Compliance Officer Program Competitive Sourcing Study
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FCO-06-01
<RESPDATE>111605

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking sources for the Fuel Compliance Officer (FCO) Program Competitive Sourcing Study.   The Fuel Compliance Program is responsible for monitoring compliance with fuel tax laws by inspecting the flow of diesel fuel throughout the fuel distribution system.  IRS initiated the FCO program to promote and ensure voluntary compliance with the dyed fuel tax laws of the United States.  The FCO’s perform inspections of diesel fuel storage and transportation tanks ensures that fuel in the commerce stream is properly dyed, sold, and used in compliance with diesel fuel laws.  The IRS imposes taxes on taxable fuel per Internal Revenue Codes (IRCs) 4041, 4081, 4082, 4083, and 4091 and penalties for the misuse of taxable fuel per IRC 6715.  Taxable fuel is defined in IRC 4083 as gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene.   Diesel fuel is any liquid (other than gasoline) that without further processing or blending, is suitable for use in diesel-powered highway vehicle, train, or boat.  This monitoring is done primarily through physical inspection of diesel fuel through the fuel distribution system- from the terminals through distributors to end-users. The FCO’s conduct four primary types of inspections:  terminal inspections, wholesale/retail inspections (can be service stations or truck stops also), end-user inspections (farmers, home heating oil customers, trucking and construction companies), and on-road vehicle screenings.  Prior to conducting the inspections, FCO’s are responsible for researching potential inspection candidates provided to them by their managers, and for coordinating with State officials the times and date of any upcoming on-road screening inspections.  Fuel volume collected for testing is generally in a quantity not to exceed four ounces per sample.   Following the inspections, the FCO’s will prepare the fuel samples collected and ship them using IRS FedEx contract to a specified IRS required laboratory.  FCO’s are required to use the IRS ExFon database system to enter inspection-related information such as: dates, times and location of inspection, results of inspection, taxpayer and fuel distributor information and comments.  The element of the FCO program that is the candidate for the A-76 competition comprises the fuel compliance officers (the inspectors) in the field, their first line managers, and the manager’s associated  administrative staff.  The remaining element of the FCO program is deemed inherently governmental; and therefore not in scope for this study.  There are currently five geographic territories and Territory Managers that are responsible for inspections throughout the United States.  There are approximately 140 Fuel Compliance Officers in the five territories.  All employees need to be able to pass the IRS Minimum Background Investigation requirements and may require a medical physical examination once every 2 years.  Service Providers should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary .

The objective of this Sources Sought announcement is to obtain capabilities statements, based on the requirements outlines above, from all interested businesses (large and small).  Responses to this request will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside or restrict competition in some way, or whether to solicit offers from all responsible sources.  Respondents should identify their interest as either a Prime Contractor or a Subcontractor.  Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-4 “Limitations on Subcontracting “ (DEC 1996) will apply.  A small business interested in bidding as a prime contractor under a set-aside program must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that compliance with this requirement can be met.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 10 pages (not including past performance information).  The capabilities statement should be tailored to this request and specifically address the company’s capabilities to provide the services outlined above.  The statement should also include information on corporate experience, as well as key staff experience with Fuel Compliance programs of similar size, scope and complexity.  The response should include past performance information on Fuel Compliance programs of similar size scope and complexity including:  Contract Name, Point of Contact, Phone Number, email address, and Description of Services Provided.  The response should address basic corporate information including annual gross revenue, number of employees in the company, number of years in business, and the primary focus of the business and associated NAICS code 488490.  The cover letter submitted in response to this request should include the following information: Company Name, Primary Point of Contact, Address, Telephone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address for POC and Interest as Prime Contractor or Subcontractor.  The cover letter should also indicate the Socioeconomic status of the company as one or more of the following:  small business, 8(a) business  HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business,  veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned business, or large business.

Please note:  This sources sought notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This sources sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to ultimately award a contract, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  Response to this request will not serve as a proposal, bid, or offer, and will not be used by the Government to form a binding contract.  The responses shall be sent to email address: theressa.c.mitchell@irs.gov  and must be received by 3:00 P.M., EST,  November 16, 2005.  All questions are due by November  9, 2005 by 3:00 P.M., EST, via email address:  theressa.c.mitchell@irs.gov   Interested Service Providers are encouraged to check the IRS website at www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/opportun.htm  on a regular basis as all information concerning the Fuel Compliance Officer Program will be posted here.

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES (COTS) SPACE FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS
<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to solicit proposals from industry for Earth to orbit space flight demonstrations of any combination of the following mission capabilities:  Period 1  a) External unpressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  b) Internal pressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  c) Internal pressurized cargo delivery, return and recovery.  Option Period 2  d) Crew Transportation.  Period 1 demonstration(s) will culminate with a rendezvous and docking or berthing with the International Space Station and either disposal or reentry and recovery, depending on the selected mission.  Proposals will also be solicited for mission capability d), crew transportation, but only as an option to Period 1 proposals for mission capability c) as listed above. The Period 2 demonstrations will consist of one or more crewed missions to the International Space Station. The option will be considered for execution only after the successful demonstration of Period 1 mission capability c).  The objective of these space flight capability demonstrations is to stimulate commercial enterprises in space and lead to innovative, cost effective access to low-Earth orbit. It is anticipated that upon the successful demonstration of any one of the mission capabilities prior to 2010 timeframe, NASA may issue a request for proposals to competitively procure commercial orbital transportation services to resupply the International Space Station. NASA anticipates that these services will be needed through at least 2015.  NASA intends to use its Space Act authority or other non-FAR authority to enter into funded agreements resulting from this announcement. One or more initial agreements are anticipated.  Because a purpose of this investment is to facilitate commercial orbital transportation service capabilities for, in part, U.S. Government use, responders need to be aware that in making awards, NASA is constrained by statutory and U.S. space transportation policy requirements. NASA anticipates releasing a draft of our announcement on or about November 22, 2005. The draft announcement briefing at NASA Johnson Space Center is tentatively planned for November 29, 2005. Additional information regarding the draft announcement briefing will be forthcoming. Comments on the draft will be due on December 06, 2005. Final issuance of the announcement will be on or about December 20, 2005. Responses will be due on January 27, 2006, and final agreements are planned to be executed in May 2006.  Please notify the Contracting Officer of your intent to respond by noon local time December 6, 2005. This non-binding letter of intent should include the company name, president, address, phone number, and point of contact. Please provide an e-mail address, in order to expedite communications. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the announcement. Potential respondents will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the announcement and amendments (if any). Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  The announcement and any related documents will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-07 - Unmanned and Unattended Underwater Surveillance (UUUS) Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
UNMANNED AND UNATTENDED UNDERWATER SURVEILLANCE (UUUS) PROGRAM

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will sponsor a Proposers’ Day conference in support of the Unmanned and Unattended Underwater Surveillance (UUUS) program on 29 November 2005, from 8:30 AM until 4:30 PM, located at the Schafer Corporation facility at 3811 Fairfax Drive, 4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22203.  The purpose of the event is to provide information on the program, promote additional discussion on the associated research topics, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to identify teaming opportunities.

The UUUS objective is to develop enabling technologies and integrate said technologies into systems for unmanned and unattended underwater surveillance of littoral and fresh water (lake and river) areas with a distributed set of both stationary and mobile assets, via a phased, multiyear program.  Advanced low power, miniature underwater sensors and sensor systems (such as acoustic, magnetic, turbulence, e-field, imaging, chemical, and biological) will be developed to detect, locate, and classify targets of interest.  MEMs sensors, multi-sensor fusion and technologies to exploit multiple phenomenological surveillance approaches are of interest.  In addition, technologies to support these fixed and mobile surveillance sensors and to enable underwater communication, tagging, geo-positioning, navigation, situation awareness, and real time, intelligent control of distributed assets will be developed.  Micro pumping and sampling systems to acquire and move chemical and biological materials will also be developed.  Electronic sensors and devices to non-intrusively monitor the state and health of divers and marine animals and to monitor key ocean and fresh water environmental parameters (such as ambient temperature, pressure, salinity, and biological emissions) are also of interest.
  
For additional information on the UUUS program, reference DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 06-03, and the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) and DD Form 254 “Contract Security Classification Specification”.  Details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria are provided in a classified addendum to the associated program BAA.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Registration is available at the following website: https://www.schafertmd.com/uuus/index.html.  Attendees must register not later than 18 November 2005.  Due to space limitations, registration will be limited to 70 persons overall and 2 persons per organization.  Attendance of the Proposers Day is voluntary, and is not required to propose to the associated BAA.  

The Proposers’ Day will be classified DOD Collateral SECRET and open to all potential proposers possessing an active security clearance at that level.  To attend, your Facility Security Officer (FSO) must fax your clearance information to the DARPA Visitor Control Center at 703-528-3902 by COB 18 November 2005.  The “Purpose of Visit” should state “Unmanned and Unattended Underwater Surveillance (UUUS) Proposers’ Day”.

Unclassified information presented at the Proposers’ Day may be subject to US Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and National Security regulations.  All attendees must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations.  
 
Immediately following the conference, potential proposers may have the opportunity to meet individually with the UUUS Program Manager, Dr. Edward Carapezza.  Individual sessions may be requested via email to mbrown@schafertmd.com. 

NOTE: DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT. ALL INQUIRIES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO BAA06-03@darpa.mil.

<DESC>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT ISSUES SOLICITATION FOR “REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS” (RFQ) FROM DEVELOPERS &/OR TEAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF “ANACOSTIA GATEWAY GOVERNMENT CENTER” (AGGC) LOCATED IN ANACOSTIA, WASHINGTON, DC


RFQ NO. POAM-2005-Q-0008-RS:	The District of Columbia government (District) is issuing a solicitation for development, design, construction and initial management of an office building to serve as the new headquarters for the District of Columbia government’s Department of Transportation (DDOT) on a site owned by the District, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, Good Hope Road and 13th Street, SE, in Washington, DC.  The project, referred to as the Anacostia Gateway Government Center (AGGC), will include 335,270 gross square feet of above grade office space on six (6) levels, 177,800 gross square feet of below grade parking for approximately 436 spaces and 14,835 useable square feet of below grade office space. The building must meet the LEED Silver Certification rating as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council. The District’s Zoning Commission has given the approval to a C-3-A PUD designation and zoning map amendment for the AGGC project.  

The District will consider development of the AGGC site either with District provided financing or with developer provided financing.  If the District chooses to provide financing for the AGGC site, it will grant a ground lease to a trustee with a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years.  The trustee will concurrently lease back to the District the ground and improvements to be constructed on the ground pursuant to a lease for a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years (the “Master Lease”).  The trustee will sell Certificates of Participation (“COPS”) in the Master Lease payments in an amount sufficient to fund the cost of development of the AGGC site.  Funds realized from the sale of the COPS will be used by the District to pay a developer for development of the AGGC site pursuant to an agreement(s) to be entered into between the developer and the District.  Alternatively, the District may consider developer provided financing for the AGGC site through any means that utilizes Master Lease payments by the District as the sole source of re-payment of the financing.         

At least thirty-five percent (35%) of the work for the AGGC development must be performed by the entities that are certified as either Small or Disadvantaged Business Enterprises by the OLBD.  The developer should note that the District’s LSDBE laws were recently amended and that the regulations and contractual clauses are being rewritten by the cognizant agencies.  In addition, the District’s E.E.O. Policies, Davis-Bacon Act (for construction work) and  Service Contract Act of 1965 (for  services activities) shall apply.           

The District will consider responses to this RFQ and evaluate the quality and capabilities of proposed developers and their team members in accordance with the factors set forth in the RFQ package.  The District is not seeking site development proposals in response to this RFQ.
