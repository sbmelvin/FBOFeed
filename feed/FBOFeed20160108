<DESC>Pre-Solicitation: <br /><br />Complete Solicitation documents and drawings will be available on or about January 26, 2016.
<p>Project Title:<br /><br />Lower Jemez Fish Structure Project</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Nine (9) instream v-notch log structures designed to enhance fish habitat in the lower Jemez River were installed ca. 1989 as part of the larger Lower Jemez River Corridor Project. Seven (7) of these structures remain and are now in various states of failure, resulting in severe riverbed and bank erosion. The Forest Service intends to have the failing v-notch log structures removed from the lower Jemez River, and restore the riverbed and banks to stable condition.</p>
<p>Scope of Contract and Description:<br /><br />This solicitation is for the river restoration construction of four (4) sections within an approximately 3-mile reach of the Jemez River on the Jemez Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest. This project includes the one section located at The Bluffs and three sections at the Spanish Queen public use sites, with a bid option that includes San Diego and Las Casitas public use sites separately. The Vista Linda site will not be a part of this contract. The goal of the project is river restoration, focused on reducing erosion and sedimentation associated with the failing structures, including removal of the existing structures and stabilization of the riverbed and banks. A secondary goal is to improve instream habitat within these river sections by reducing the overall bankfull width/depth ratio, which will help reduce water temperatures and increase the quantity of pool habitat. The restoration construction incorporates natural channel design techniques for this Rosgen C3 reach, including the use of large woody debris (LWD) and boulders in the channel and floodplain. Increasing LWD and boulder placement will also increase pool habitat over time as well as promote bar formation and woody riparian vegetation establishment.<br /><br />The Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Removal existing v-notch log structures and disposal of removed material,<br />&bull; Procurement of all needed material as specified by the design (design provided by the Forest Service),<br />&bull; Construction of structures as designed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary perform the work specified in the contract.</p>
<p>The performance period will be starting approximately late February early March, 2016. Contract time will be 120 calendar days.<br /><br />This project is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside Project</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. LSM 880 2+1Ch NLO Ar, 543, 633LSM 880 Microscope System with Trade-In: Removal of Scan Head, Laser Module and Electronics Box, (Specified Brand Name: Carl Zeiss Microscopy) NO REFURBISHED OR USED SYSTEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE, Quantity: One Each, Catalog Number: 4109002147072000, 12 Month Warranty, Base System includes: 458,488,514,543 or 561, 633nm lasers; HP 30" monitor HP Z820 with 64 GB RAM Included.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The NHGRI Medical Genetic Branch (MGB)</p>
<p>The NHGRI/Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) seeks to identify and understand inherited disorders of metabolism and of human development. MGB investigators focus on human genetics, vertebrate embryology, inborn errors of metabolism, and neurogenetic disorders. Projects performed at the biochemical, molecular, and cell biological levels involve the direct study of human subjects as well as the development and use of experimental model systems, such as zebrafish and mouse. The Branch fosters outstanding basic research and serves as a model for translational research, emphasizing the compassionate and scientifically rigorous application of basic science discoveries at the bedside. Branch researchers develop and test new diagnostic tests and treatments for patients with rare genetic disorders in the NIH Clinical Center.</p>
<p>To achieve their goals, MGB investigators use a variety of cutting-edge techniques to address questions regarding disease pathophysiology and human development. In addition to making extensive and selective use of genomic data, MGB researchers routinely capitalize on partnerships with key laboratories at NHGRI, NIH, and worldwide. The Branch attracts patients with rare disorders and engages in collaborations that have led to the acquisition of large sample sets from unique populations. Studies of these rare patients and populations have proven invaluable for advancing the mission of the Branch.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVES:</span></p>
<p>The confocal microscope is a very high precision and expensive instrument. This system is used by many people to gather many high quality images for publication and patient diagnosis. NHGRI Scientific Research Investigators utilizes cell biology to look at cells, tissues, and organisms in order to diagnose, understand, and possibly help to treat genetic disorders and undiagnosed diseases. Confocal microscopy enables researchers to fluorescently label and scan our labeled samples with high resolution in x,y, and z point by point or multiple points at once. In addition to looking at fixed samples with multi-labeled proteins and markers, researchers can also image live cells and organisms to see what is happening in real-time and over time to provide qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
<p>NHGRI have been utilizing Zeiss LSM 510META since 2004 as a necessary tool. NHGRI has invested significant time and money into this system and the imaging facility and researchers are quite dependent upon it to help accomplish research goals. Researchers use this system to look at both fixed samples and live samples under a variety of conditions. The LSM880 will allow researchers to bring imaging capabilities up to current capabilities. In upgrading the equipment scientific investigators will be able to increase sensitivity, resolution, and speed of imaging. This will aid researchers in correctly imaging and collecting data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:</span></p>
<p>Carl Zeiss is the manufacturer of the LSM 880 instrument and they have engineers from Zeiss with in-depth knowledge and training to upgrade such complex microscope system. The microscopes are custom built by Carl Zeiss and any changes or upgrades must be done by Zeiss. Carl Zeiss have the expertise to take the old system, which will no longer be supported by warranty and upgrade it to a current system with increased optimal use for the next 20 years.<br />ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />Delivery Upon Award</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DELIVERABLES:</span></p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver equipment to NIH, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:</span></p>
<p>Upon delivery, investigators at the National Heart, Lung and Blood (NHLBI), National Institute of Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) will inspect the equipment before acceptance.</p>

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is
anticipated pending configuration changes.

<DESC>This is the synopsis of Repair BOA N00383-14-G-001D with Honeywell International, Inc., Defense  and  Space, Tempe AZ and various other Honeywell repair facilities in USA and UK, and serves as the pre-solicitation notice for all repair orders issued by NAVSUP WSS  for the period from adding the items to the BOA (estimated 30 April 2016) of one year for evaluation and repair of various components of the P-8 aircraft  weapons systems.  A representative sample of the types of items covered under this Annual Synopsis is as follows: 
NIIN 01-573-3495, Auxiliary Power Unit, P/N 3800702-1, estimated quantity 2 ea;
NIIN 01-627-6038, NRP, Display Unit, P/N 4091900-942, estimated quantity 5ea;
NIIN 99-385-4547, Detector, Gas, P/N 3522W000-001, estimated quantity 5ea;
A complete list of potential repairable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the listed point of contact.
 Honeywell is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these requirements and is the only known source to possess full repair capability. Complete data, drawings and the rights to same are not available from the Government. Therefore, the above-cited items are sole source to Honeywell. Even though the items are sole source to Honeywell, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, D. McGettigan, N721.03, at (215) 697-6549.
The items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
 Only the sources previously approved by the Government will be solicited.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Gamma Technology to provide its simulation software, GT Suite, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures under NAICS Code 541519  Other Computer Related Services with a small business standard of $27,000,000.00.  

The EPA has a requirement for software that allows for total engine and vehicle simulations in an integrated powertrain and vehicle platform.  This software is necessary for the EPA to perform various engine and vehicle simulations in order to effectively address many technical issues related to GHG rulemaking.  The software required by EPA must allow the user the ability to plug and play and build any engine, vehicle and combination of both into a platform to run the simulation in a cost effective manner.   The software must link vehicle with engine, and engine with engine cooling system and fuel injection system, and engine with after treatment device in a compact and integrated form. The software shall also be 100% compatible with all of the models that EPA has already built in GT-Suite. The software required by EPA has to virtually cover all components associated with engine and vehicle.  Examples include engine, after treatment devices (SCR, LNT, DOC and DPF), transmission, driveline, engine cooling system, beaning, fuel injection system, and hybrid vehicles.  

Gamma Technology, Inc is the only known source able to satisfy the software requirements for the EPA.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing this type of software may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit capabilities documentation via the FedConnect website at www.fedconnect.net. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>Special Notice:  PreSolicitation/Preproposal Conference Notice SOL-R5-15-00007
NOTICE:  This is not a solicitation but a presolicitation synopsis.  THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.  No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.
This synopsis is for non-personal services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regular (FAR) Subpart 5.2.  These services previously were acquired using General Service Administration (GSA) 8(a) Streamlined Technology Acquisition Resources for Services (STARS) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Information Technology Support Services (ITSS).  The U.S EPA, Region 5`s main office is located in Chicago, IL and is the primary location for performance.  Additional IT support services will be required at alternate and satellite locations listed in the Performance Work Statement.  The Region 5's territories of responsibilities include Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. Currently, the Region 5 IT contract supports over approximately 1500 users which fluctuate in the spring and fall for interns.
The support services include six (6) major tasks;  1) Voice/Data Telecommunications Support, 2) Network Infrastructure Support (Windows Servers, and Storage Area Network Systems Administration, Wireless Local Area Network, Laboratory Information Management Systems), 3) Help Desk Support, 4) Database Administration Support, 5) Computer Network and System Security Support, and 6) External Networks Technical Support.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, with a size standard of $27,500,000.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A firm-fixed price, performance based contract will be used to award ONE vendor a one-year base period contract with two (2), one (1)-year options, for a maximum total contract period of performance of three (3) years.  It is anticipated the acquisition will use Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation procedures.  In December 2015, the Agency anticipates issuing a request for proposals (RFP).  The Agency anticipates making award in February 2016 with the period of performance commencing by April 2016.  The estimated cost for the base period and all option periods will be between $5M and $10M.

The Agency anticipates keeping this requirement in the 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program, and set-aside for Small Business Administration subcontractors also known as 8(a) Contractors.  Prospective vendors MUST be actively registered as a SBA 8(a) firm, a small business concern at least 51 percent owned, controlled, managed, and operated on a daily basis by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged persons.  Interested parties are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  EPA uses Fedconnect for an acquisition system and will require prospective vendors to register with Feconnect.net for the submission of offers.  Access can be established at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.
Historically, the services provided were considered professional services for twenty-eight (28) full-time employees (FTE) and the Service Contract Act did not apply.  If vendors are providing services which are not exempt, the Service Contract Act may apply.  Offers will need to be clear on what job categories/titles are being proposed so a clear distinction of professional versus non-professional duties can be made. Since the Service Contract Act did not previously apply, the right for first refusal under Executive Order "Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contract Act" did not apply. 
THE COLLABORATIVE OBJECTIVE of the preproposal conference is two-fold.  First the event permits prospective vendors an opportunity to visit the site.  Second, the event permits exchanges between Government and industry.  Reference FAR 15.2.
Region 5, U.S. EPA is hosting a Small Business Conference on November 10, 2015.  Between 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm, a preproposal conference for the Region 5 EPA ITSS will occur on the 12th floor at 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.  Due to space limitations, attendance to the Conference will be limited to a total of two (2) representatives from each interested vendor.  Interested vendors wishing to attend must convey its interest, the names of the individuals attending, and e-mail address for the contractor's single point of contact (POC) no later than close of business October 30, 2015.  In addition, please register at: http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/forms/register-region-5-small-business-conference.  
Attached is a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for industry review and feedback  The preproposal conference will afford interested parties an opportunity to provide feedback directly to the Information Management Branch and provide preliminary technical information and discussion on the draft PWS.  In case you cannot attend the conference, all questions and answers received during the conference will be posted.  You can also submit comments/questions on the draft PWS to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Sara king via email @ king.sara@epa.gov.  All responses to comments/questions received via email will be included in the posting.  The Draft PWS is subject to change as key elements of the acquisition strategy(ies) are being determined.
Incumbent contractor is Ensoftek Inc., under GSA contract GS-06-1145Z.  The EPA direct task order award EP-G155-00356 was for $2,886, 674.04.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Steiner , Phone 202-205-8926, Email Elizabeth.Steiner@hhs.gov
<DESC>Within the Federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures for the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to CBRN threat agents, pandemics and emerging infectious disease threats.
<p>HHS, through the interagency Public Health Emergency and Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is responsible for the integration of requirements for the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for CBRN, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious disease threats. The 2014 HHS PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan describes the strategic policy goals and objectives for identifying requirements and establishes the priorities for the development of the medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The Nonclinical Studies Network is a key element in the successful development of medical countermeasures for biological threats, particularly since efficacy of products directed against most of these threats cannot be verified using clinical studies. The United States Government (USG) therefore seeks appropriate Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) facilities that are adequate and available to support establishing new or existing animal tests and/or models for the development of Biological Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) against biological threats, influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The United States Government (USG) seeks to maintain a network of GLP laboratories that will provide capability for nonclinical animal studies, analytical services, and toxicology services in support of the BARDA portfolio. In these models, the challenge dose generally should be the same as that which produces the human disease or condition and the pathophysiological mechanism of its toxicity should be reasonably well-understood and mimic the human disease/condition as closely as possible. When these models are used to test the efficacy of potential MCMs for CRN agents, the mechanism of action of the countermeasure will need to establish the utility of the animal model as a surrogate for humans. BARDA anticipates that contracts awarded from this RFP will serve to facilitate the animal model development of medical countermeasures and/or supportive reagents and assays for regulatory acceptance in the U.S.</p>
<p>HHS, through AMCG and BARDA, anticipates 9-12 contract awards will be made to establish capabilities in toxicology, analytical services and nonclinical (animal) testing through Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The anticipated period of performance for any resultant contracts will be for a total of up to 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. Offeror's will be required to respond to Sample Request for Task Order Response (RTOR) documents as part of their proposal.</p>

<DESC><p>The work described herein involves the replacement/upgrade of the navigation lock downstream gate hoist mechanical machinery and the associated electrical and control equipment, and the rehabilitation of the gate hoist friction sheaves.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Ice Harbor navigation lock downstream gate is a counterbalanced vertical lift gate and measures approximately 90 feet tall by 88 feet wide and weighs approximately 740 tons. The gate is connected to two counterweights (one on each side) with twelve 2-1/4 inch diameter wire ropes. The hoist machinery is located in two machinery rooms located at the top of the downstream structural towers, one on each side of the lift gate. The wire ropes pass over an 18 foot diameter friction sheave. The friction sheave is driven through an electric hydraulic pump driving a high speed hydraulic motor. The speed is reduced and torque increased through a gearbox having an external pinion driving the gear around the perimeter of the sheave. The wire rope passes over the uppermost surface of the hoist sheave. The two hoist sheaves support the cumulative weight of the gate, the counterweight, and the hoist ropes.</p>
<p>The downstream lift gate hoist machinery is the original machinery installed when the lock was placed into service in 1969, with the exception of a coupling (replaced in 1980), pedestal mounting system (added in 1980), output gear in box (reversed due to bent shaft in 1980), gearboxes and hydraulic system (replaced in 1989), hoist wire ropes (replaced in 2012). Electrical and control systems are original.</p>
<p>Summary of Work</p>
<p>Mechanical upgrades consist of the hoist drive components required to operate the gate, the overhead service crane in each machinery room, and the mechanical aspects of limits and controls for gate operation.</p>
<p>Furnish and install the following items for the hoist drives in each machinery room: new pillow block bearings, ring gears, pinion gears, pinion shafts, pinion bearings, couplings, and brakes. In addition, install new Government furnished gearboxes.</p>
<p>Install new bearings and ring gear for the friction sheaves in each machinery room. In order to replace the friction sheave bearings and ring gears, the contractor must have technical experience, labor, and physical plant required for jacking and shoring of the existing 18 foot diameter friction sheaves that weigh approximately 112,000 pounds each and the counterweights which weigh approximately 740,000 pounds each. Upon completion of the bearing replacement, the contractor will be responsible for precise alignment of the friction sheave bearings and the alignment of open gear contact between the new pinion gears and the existing friction sheave ring gears.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous elements of the contract include RCRA 8 metal based paint and asbestos containing material (ACM) removal and disposal from existing equipment, and reroofing both tower roofs with a liquid applied membrane.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for gate hoist wire rope load balancing that will require the services of a qualified engineer with a minimum of three years experience with load cells and load monitoring equipment to ensure the loads are evenly distributed across all hoist wire ropes at the completion of the work. The overhead service cranes in each machinery room will be replaced with commercially-available four ton rated electric wire rope hoists. New overhead cranes shall be single-girder top running bridge-type furnished with pendant style pushbutton remote control and wall-mounted pushbutton control station. Structural upgrades consist of weld repair of the downstream gate hoist friction sheaves, fabrication and installation of new machinery supports and pedestals, fabrication and installation of new safety handrails, and structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels.</p>
<p>Structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels consist of the installation of an adhesive anchor system to increase the load capacity of the corbels from 5,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds. Evaluate concrete drilling locations for the presence of existing reinforcing steel with Ground Penetrating Radar or an approved equivalent method. Electrical upgrades consist of replacement of the machinery room motor control centers and power supply wiring and circuit breakers, installation of new variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped motors, new main power disconnects, new power distribution blocks, new VFD's, new control voltage transformers, new dynamic brake resistors, new programmable logic controllers (PLC), new network switches, new fiber optic panels, and new control relays.</p>
<p>New PLC installations require the contractor to provide PLC program development, licensed software packages, shop testing, and operator field tests. New VFD installations require specified hardware, programming software, onsite installation supervision by the VFD manufacturer, VFD test plans, and execution of performance verification tests.</p>
<p>New control panel, graphic panel, and equipment panel installations require specified hardware to be verified through Government-witnessed shop testing prior to delivery to the work site. A critical element of the project involves complex sequencing and coordination of commissioning and cut-over of new equipment and systems, and highly technical interfaces between new and old systems. The Contractor must demonstrate experience and qualifications necessary to manage challenging Quality Control and Commissioning programs for both factory and on-site testing requirements. The project involves long lead time procurement of complex electrical and control equipment and fabrication of large mechanical gears. Complete on-site work in close coordination with the Government lock and dam facility, and minimize outages and disruptions to operations.</p>

<p>Subject: Expression of Interest (EOI)</p>
<p>Reference: Future Solicitation for Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC) services at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)</p>
<p>Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking an expression of interest from firms in relation to a major construction/renovation project at BNL located in Upton, NY. It is the intent of BSA to utilize the CMGC procurement methodology for this project, which has a project cost estimated to be approximately $30,000,000. The purpose here is to inform the local construction community of our intent and to provide qualified firms the opportunity to express their interest in partnering with BSA to execute this work via the CMGC project execution methodology. Responses will be retained for record and referenced for future Requests for Proposals.</p>
<p>CMGC has become widely used throughout the Department of Energy's Office of Science for significant construction projects. Identifying and partnering with highly qualified firms is critical to the success of CMGC projects.

The Morgantown, WV site of the NETL has a requirement to maintain a high speed communications service to the 3ROX. The communications service is required to support computer modeling and simulation work performed by the NETL?s Office of Research and Development.  WVU is the only known vendor in the Morgantown, WV area that can provide the fully managed communications service between the NETL Morgantown, WV site and 3ROX.
This is considered a sole source to WVU because, to the best of NETL's knowledge and based on market research conducted, WVU is the only service with the required bandwidth to manage the communication services.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:00 PM ET on January 23, 2016.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Erin.Kirchoff@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the value of conferences that are relevant to its mission and to the public interest. Conferences permit individuals and organizations to engage in a variety of activities that are critical to the development and implementation of NIST programs and play an important role in fulfilling NIST's mission.</p>
<p>Conferences are an effective way to bring together various groups of people to share information, educate the scientific community and the public, work with state and local government partners, and/or learn from non-governmental stakeholders.</p>
<p>Conference planning at NIST has been centralized within the Conference Program, part of the NIST/Public &amp; Business Affairs Office. The Program supports NIST Laboratories and Major Programs at NIST sites in Gaithersburg, MD, Boulder, CO, and Charleston, SC, by providing professional conference planning and conference-related support services in a cost effective manner and in accordance with all Government rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The Government is contemplating a procurement to establish an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide conference support services for NIST. Conference support services shall include, at a minimum: Registration, website creation, travel arrangements and reimbursement, obtaining meeting space, speaker support services, and audio visual support.</p>
<p>Within the scope of this IDIQ, the Contractor will be required to provide professional services to NIST to perform subject matter analysis, implementation and reporting, opportunities document development and in-depth analytical strategic, and project management advice and support. These services will focus on the following technological areas: <br />-Chemical, Physical and Materials Sciences; <br />-Biotechnology;<br />-Manufacturing, Construction and Physical Infrastructure;<br />-Medical Technology; and <br />-Information Technology.<br />Selected technological focus areas may also be cross-disciplinary and include subsets of more than one of the above areas.</p>
<p>Conference support will include workshop development in the technological areas above as well as other technical and administrative areas.</p>
<p>Given that this requirement anticipates the Contractor will have access to personally identifiable information (PII) that will be transmitted and stored electronically, the Contractor will be required to possess, at a minimum, an authorized FedRAMP security and privacy controls package at a moderate level, or FedRAMP authorization or an Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter issued by a Federal Government agency as proof of evidence that the Contractor has been assessed and authorized at the moderate level. If using an ATO letter, that letter shall clearly state that the Contractor has been authorized at the moderate level.</p>
<p>The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is a United States Law that recognized the importance of information security. The Act requires that all federal agencies develop, document and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided by or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. The FISMA requirements are not just for websites, but apply to any vendor, network, or computing environment that has NIST data in it. FedRAMP was developed to be compliant with FISMA.</p>
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) is a risk management program for large outsourced and multi-agency information systems used by the U.S. Government. FedRAMP authorizes and continuously monitors IT services that are used by multiple federal departments and agencies. This approach uses a "do once, use many times" framework that will save cost, time, and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments.</p>
<p>The requirement for FedRAMP approval and/or the Authorization to Operate applies when the Contractor, and possibly their subcontractors, will have access to personally identifiable information. This process of assessing the Contractor's (and subcontractor's) processes and procedures with respect to the handling and securing of PII is not limited to electronic data, but also applies to data that is or will be maintained in hard copy form as well.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541611, as those domestic sources having annual revenues of $15.0M or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct one or more competitive procurement(s) and subsequently award contracts. If at least two qualified small business are identified during this market research stage, then competitive procurements that result would be anticipated to be conducted small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The following information is required to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br /><br />1. Does your company currently possess FEDRAMP or ATO certification from any Government Agency? <br />This question also applies to all subcontractors with whom you would consider working.</p>
<p>If submitting an ATO letter, the letter must clearly state the impact level (i.e., moderate or high), at which the Contractor has been assessed and authorized. If subcontractors are involved, each party must have the above stated FedRAMP authorization or Federal agency-issued ATO letter stating the authorization;</p>
<p>2. While FedRAMP authorization or ATO is preferred, in lieu of the above, the Contractor and its intended subcontractors, may demonstrate that they have passed an independent security audit (e.g. Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE), PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)). The Contractor shall provide to NIST, a description of the audit(s) performed, evidence of the audit(s), or instructions on how to obtain evidence of the above, if the Contractor has had any audits described above or other security audit;</p>
<p>3. Relevant documentation which demonstrates your company's overall capability to complete any or all tasks associated with planning for conferences and workshops of any size from 20 persons to 500 persons;</p>
<p>4. Documentation of the company's expertise in the areas of Chemical, Physical and Materials Sciences; Biotechnology; Manufacturing, Construction &amp; Physical Infrastructure; Medical Technology; and Information Technology;</p>
<p>5. Documentation of the company's expertise in the areas of subject matter analysis, implementation and reporting, opportunities document development and in-depth analytical strategic, and project management as they apply to task areas identified;</p>
<p><br />6. Documentation of the company's existing compliance or willingness to comply with the following information technology security standards as defined on the attached sheet: <br />-IPV 6<br />-Section 508<br />-Authentication and<br />-Incident Response.</p>
<p>7. Name and business size of the company;</p>
<p>8. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than Wednesday, January 20, 2016, at 3:30 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<p><strong><br />Introduction:</strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong><br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. <br /> <br />The NINDS Sleep Laboratory is a part of the Electroencephalography (EEG) Section, which is part of the Office of the Clinical Director, NINDS.  Its mission is two-fold: 1) to provide clinical diagnostic and therapeutic sleep studies to patients participating in research protocols at the NIH Clinical Center, and 2) to provide research support to intramural investigators in developing and carrying out research protocols related to sleep and sleep disorders, including protocol development, obtaining and interpreting sleep and EEG recordings, and designing appropriate testing protocols and outcomes.<br /><br />At least 40 million Americans each year suffer from chronic, long-term sleep disorders, and an additional 20 million experience occasional sleep problems. These disorders and the resulting sleep deprivation interfere with cognition, rehabilitation, work, driving, and social activities. They also account for an estimated $16 billion in medical costs each year, while the indirect costs due to lost productivity and other factors are probably much greater. In addition to primary sleep disorders, many neurologic, psychiatric and other medical diseases have associated sleep disturbances, many of which can be managed effectively once they are correctly diagnosed.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:</strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the NINDS EEG Section, under the Office of the Clinical Director, with professional consulting support services to assist in the analysis and interpretation of polysomnographic studies, as well as in providing technical expertise to assist intramural investigators with study design and outcome measures in the protocols investigating sleep or sleep disorders.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements:</strong><br />The Contractor shall provide the following professional consulting support services:<br /><br />&bull;	Analyze and assist in overseeing the analysis of sleep staging, heart rate, respiratory status (including oxygen saturation rate), limb movements, arousal and unusual behaviors.<br /><br />&bull;	Interpret sleep study clinical findings; make clinical correlation and treatment plan recommendations.<br /><br />&bull;	Serve as a sleep medicine technical expert to the NIH/NINDS staff on study design and outcome measures. <br /><br />&bull;	Prepare, deliver, and track records of final sleep study interpretation for studies performed at the NIH Clinical Center by the NIH/NINDS staff. Reports shall be completed in the template provided by the Government (see sample report, attachment A). The Program Office and Contractor may discuss updates to the template during the award period of performance. Reports will be submitted to a NIH secure shared drive as a PDF within ten (10) days after study completion. <br /><br />&bull;	Provide activity status reports and assessment updates as needed to the EEG Section Chief. This includes a periodic summary of number of studies completed and hours required for completion, as well as discussions of technologist performance and other technical, clinical or performance issues on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Level of Effort:</strong><br />The level of effort is estimated at one (1) contractor employee for 60 labor hours per contract period.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, and IS NOT a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP or RFQ). Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD), Lakehurst, NJ, is seeking information about companies who have the capability to design and build a Capstan Actuator Test System (CATS) for the V-22 Osprey if provided the Capstan Actuator Drive and Control Module Wing Stow Drawing and Parts List, a Statement of Work for the Test System, the current Acceptance Test Procedures for the Capstan Actuator, and specifications for the CATS itself. This RFI is released to determine if there are manufacturers who have an interest in providing a fully qualified CATS. Those potential manufacturers are asked to identify themselves as part of current market research to determine if competition is feasible for the required CATS.
<p><br />This RFI requests information from potential offerors able to provide CATS that are built to provide test results for Capstan Actuators that have undergone Depot repairs and refurbishment. The end product will include providing NAWC-AD a complete production level drawing package and specifications (including adequate rights for future competition and possible manufacture by a third party). Potential manufacturers are asked to only provide their Name, Contact Information, CAGE code, and any small business categories they may qualify for. The drawings and some information associated with a potential competition is export controlled. This IS NOT a request for potential manufacturers to send DD2345s or any sort of proposal specific information. It does inform of a requirement for a valid DD2345 should this progress to an active RFP. Any information beyond the requested Business Name, Contact Information, CAGE Code and Small Business Categories will not be retained by the contract office during the interim period between this RFI and any potential RFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this requirement is released for competition, the end product would be a CATS that meets performance and design requirements set forth in a) performing tests required in the ATP for Capstan Actuator and b) Technical Specifications for the CATS. Based on information received, applicable Small Business Set Asides may be used in any eventual competition.</p>
<p>Once again, this is a Request for Information only, not an RFP or RFQ. The only action requested is to self-identify interest in providing CATS to NAWC-AD for Market Research purposes only. In the event a solicitation is released for CATS at a future date, a presolicitation notice will be posted to FBO requesting interested and qualified manufacturers (based on small business category) send a DD2345 to the contract specialist, and they will be provided at that time the necessary information to provide a proposal based on all of the necessary information to propose a CATS.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>REQUEST FOR SOURCES SOUGHT<br />SOFATL-KP2015-PMCP</strong><br /><br />DESCRIPTION: USSOCOM is requesting the identification of sources as it determines the appropriate limitation of full and open competition for a possible future requirement. USSOCOM is contemplating award of a five-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Counterproliferation support. At this time, USSOCOM is anticipating competition to be limited to include only Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and is interested in determining interested sources. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to evaluate the current industry landscape and determine if there are enough interested SDVOSBs, capable of performing these very specific services, to warrant an SDVOSB set-aside. This Sources Sought, however, is not limited to only SDVOSBs. All Small Businesses are encouraged to submit a package. If it is determined that there are not enough capable SDVOSBs to compete the effort as a set-aside, or that given the industry response it is not in USSOCOMs best interest to do so, the results of the Sources Sought will still be used to determine the most appropriate path forward.<br /><br />As a requirement for this award, the SDVOSB must be capable of conducting at least 50 percent of the workload (or be able to combine with other SDVOSBs to reach 50 percent of the workload) for all five years per FAR 52.219-27(d)(1). Current staffing levels are approximately 30 personnel annually split between Aberdeen, NC (16) and Virginia Beach, VA (14). Contract award is anticipated no later than December 2015.<br /><br />The IDIQ contract shall provide critical services for development, product improvement, training, testing, acquisition support, logistics support, and other related technical and engineering support services to Special Operations Forces (SOF) focused on counter Radio Controlled Explosive Improvised Device (RCIED), Explosive Ordnance Demolition (EOD), Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), and Counterproliferation (CP).<br /><br />All interested parties shall submit a White Paper not to exceed 7 pages. Specific directions as to the format and substance of this White Paper are attached. In addition, a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) which is needed to respond is attached.&nbsp; Both of these attachments have been uploaded with explicit access only, and therefore each interested party will need to request access via FBO.&nbsp; FBO granted access is the preferred method however if an interested party cannot receive access via FBO&nbsp;it can be reviewed and granted by the contracting officer directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the Contracting Officer should be contacted directly&nbsp;with documentation the&nbsp;offeror is registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the profile reflects that the offeror is registered with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 541990 for All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services and/or 541330 Engineering Services.&nbsp; Interested parties must not be on the Excluded Parties List (EPLS) https://www.epls.gov/.<br /><br />All white papers shall be submitted electronically to both the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist (POC information below in this posting) by the designated deadline.&nbsp; This deadline may be extended as determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), is providing an invitation to interested contractors to attend and participate in an Industry Day presentation pertaining to VHA Recruitment Services on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 via teleconference. The presentation of information and the subsequent submission of feedback/comments from industry is considered an exchange of information (FAR 15.201). The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services, ascertain reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.

An agenda is being planned whereby the SAC and VHA Workforce Management & Consulting for VHA Recruitment Services intend to share its strategic goals, priorities and objectives. An agenda will be provided to registrants at a later date.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is evaluating the market to determine if there are commercial vendors with the capacity to assist VHA with the recruitment of experienced Physicians, Nurses, Pharmacists and other critical healthcare professionals.  In response to the need to rapidly improve access to care for our veterans and to augment the "hiring spree" announced by the Secretary, additional recruitment resources will be useful to help recruit healthcare professionals to the VHA's 1400+ medical centers and outpatient clinics throughout the continental Unites States and Puerto Rico.  In order to achieve the momentum necessary for sustained transformation, we must have the capability to engage, attract, and recruit the best talent and promote VHA as the healthcare provider of choice. 

Physicians within VHA are dedicated to ensuring that the men and women who served this country are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  VHA is experiencing significant shortfalls in its physician workforce particularly specialties of Mental Health, Gastroenterology, Radiology, etc, causing lengthy wait-times for veterans seeking care and significant increased cost associated with outsourcing services through fee-for-service, use of interim staff, and direct referrals for medical care outside VHA.  Given the current shortage of physicians and increasingly competitive recruitment environment, as well as the urgency of the need, VHA is seeking recruiting support in sourcing qualified candidates for physician and non-healthcare provider vacancies.

<p>USDA APHIS MRPBS AAMD<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Suite 510C<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>Situation</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal, Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) Miami field office provides boarding services to horses that are traveling in and out of the United States (US). This office requires roughly 13,000 bales of 100% white pine shaving premium horse bedding per year. The Miami field office currently has a BPA in place to provide this bedding.</p>
<p>The field office along with the contracting specialist were informed in December of 2015 that the contractor with the BPA in place, could no longer provide bedding at this time and that USDA would have to seek other sources for at least a short period of time. It was determined that an interim PO be issued for a 6-8 week supply of bedding while new contractor/s were sought and new BPA/s were put in place.</p>
<p>The estimated timeframe to solicit RFQs and award BPAs needed to be extended and the interim PO needed to be modified to provide for the needed bedding during this extended time. This Modification to the PO increased the quantity of bales from 4,160 to 6,400. The estimated time for which these bales are expected to satisfy the current need was extended from January 31st to February 28th. The PO was increased in value from $21,840.00 to $33,600.00.</p>
<p>This notice in published in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1)(ii). The contracting specialist for this action is Jeremy Pouliot. Any questions can be directed to Jeremy.pouliot@aphis.usda.gov or at 612-336-3204.</p>

<DESC><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT</strong><br /><strong>TITLE:</strong> Stryker Mobile Gun System (MGS) Advanced Gunnery Training System (AGTS)<br /><strong>CLOSING DATE:</strong> 09 February 2016
<p><strong>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Procurement:</strong> Market Research is being conducted to verify that no other sources can meet the requirement to develop, integrate, and install Training Circular (TC) 3-20.31 software upgrades on the Stryker MGS AGTS, manufacture, produce, and install mobile and tabletop Stryker MGS AGTS, and develop and deliver New Equipment Training for the Stryker MGS AGTS. Interested sources are invited to provide their company's capability statement to support this program as described in this Sources Sought program description, acquisition approach, and delivery schedule as described herein.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</strong> Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (LM MST) has been the sole source, prime contractor since the inception of the Stryker MGS AGTS program competitively awarded in 2006, and for all subsequent upgrades and improvements to the Stryker MGS AGTS and its derivatives. The Stryker MGS AGTS upgrades and improvements are based on a proprietary system design developed at private expense by LM MST and 10 U.S.C. 2320(a)(2)(F)(i) precludes the Department of Defense from making release or sale of proprietary technical data a condition of contracting with the Government. The Government possesses only Limited Purpose Data Rights, with Restricted Data Rights on some software components. The Manufacturing Technical Data Package (TDP), which includes manufacturing drawings, hardware technical data, crew station molds and runtime software, is not owned by the Government.</p>
<p>Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PdM GCTT) has a requirement to upgrade the instructional subsystem of the Stryker MGS AGTS training devices to the latest gunnery training standards found in TC 3-20.31 to ensure that the AGTS trains to the exact gunnery standards that Stryker MGS crews will be evaluated against during live fire gunnery qualifications and to prepare crews for their wartime tasks. The contractor will develop the software modifications, conduct Government Acceptance Testing, and deliver and install the software at the first delivery site, then test again with the Government to ensure full functionality. In total, the contractor shall provide software upgrade kits (software and documentation) for thirteen (13) full fidelity Stryker MGS AGTS, eleven (11) tabletop Stryker MGS AGTS, and two (2) Pre-Briefing After-Action Review (PAAR) Stations for the Stryker MGS AGTS.</p>
<p>PdM GCTT has a requirement to produce and deliver up to one (1) mobile Stryker MGS AGTS to the 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) upon their transition from an Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). Upon the exercise of the option for one mobile Stryker MGS AGTS, the contractor will produce one new mobile Stryker MGS AGTS and spares based on the existing designs for already-fielded systems, conduct production testing with Government personnel, and deliver them to the site. Once on-site, the contractor will setup the system and conduct on-site acceptance testing with Government personnel to ensure full functionality of the system.</p>
<p>PdM GCTT has a requirement to produce and deliver up to five (5) tabletop Stryker MGS AGTS systems to the 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) upon their transition from an Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). Upon the exercise of each option for one tabletop Stryker MGS AGTS, the contractor will produce one new tabletop Stryker MGS AGTS and spares based on the existing designs for already-fielded systems, conduct production testing with Government personnel, and deliver them to the site. Once on-site, the Government will setup the system and conduct on-site acceptance to ensure full functionality of the system.</p>
<p>PdM GCTT has a requirement to produce and deliver up to ten (10) Stryker MGS AGTS New Equipment Training (NET) Courses to each Stryker MGS AGTS site. Upon the exercise of each option for one Stryker MGS AGTS NET course, the contractor will produce the materials for and provide a 5 day Stryker MGS AGTS NET course at the site specified in the contract based on the existing Stryker MGS AGTS NET course curriculum. The course will include classroom and practical application focusing on the AGTS instructional subsystem, instructor/operator duties, daily readiness, diagnostics, student records, deploy ability and transportability of the system, and the overall operation of the system.</p>
<p><strong>ACQUISITION APPROACH:</strong> PEO STRI Acquisition Center intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302 (a) (2) (ii) (A). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to award a new Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with Time and Material (T&amp;M) contract line item numbers to LM MST. Execution of the contract is projected for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2017 (FY 17). The total contract period of performance will not exceed five years to include all options.</p>
<p>LM MST alone possesses the required system technical data and knowledge needed to integrate subsystems effectively to meet user performance criteria. Consequently, the proprietary design of AGTS as described are unique to LM MST. Since upgrades and improvements will use the existing AGTS as a basis for the upgraded components, knowledge of the existing system is imperative in order to ensure a smooth transition between the current AGTS and the improved AGTS configuration.</p>
<p><strong>ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:</strong> Approximately $7.1M</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY:</strong> Production, delivery, installation, and testing of the TC 3-20.31 upgrades is due 15 months after contract award. Production, delivery, installation, and testing of each new mobility systems is due one year and six months after each option is exercised.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, limited source, fixed price contract with Life Technologies Corporation, 5791 Van Allen Way, Carlsbad, CA 92008-7321 for the purpose of procuring one Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and necessary associated peripherals.
<p>In order to support the FBI Laboratory's DNA program activities by advancing the technologies applied to DNA casework and expand the range of specimens from which probative data can be recovered, the DNA Support Unit (DSU) is evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) instruments/technologies. DSU's pilot studies to date have been conducted using the MiSeqFGx, an NGS instrument manufactured by Illumina, Inc. However, now that NGS has been shown to be a worthy technology for future DNA casework application, it is necessary for DSU to compare and evaluate different NGS instruments/technologies offered by other vendors in order to adequately assess the options and determine the most promising technology for BAS applications. The Ion Torrent<sup>TM</sup> PGM, an NGS instrument manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation, employs a specialized chemistry and detection system different than the system employed by the MiSeqFGx; therefore it is critical that DSU acquire an Ion Torrent<sup>TM</sup> PGM so DSU can test both instruments side-by-side in order to assess which platform has the most potential for BAS casework applications. The Ion Torrent<sup>TM</sup> PGM instrument and associate peripherals are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; 1 Ion Torrent Sequencer- S5 system<br />&bull; 1 Ion S5 installation kit<br />&bull; Ion S5 customer training (on-site)<br />&bull; 1 Ion Chef System<br />&bull; 1 Ion Chef installation kit</p>
<p><br />Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Life Technologies Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and necessary associated peripherals.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: <strong>Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Friday, January 15, 2016, 2016 (3:00 pm Eastern).</strong> Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Vision Research, Inc., 100 Dey Road, Wayne, NJ 07470. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 333316, Photographic and Photocopying Equipment Manufacturing; the size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Vision Research, Inc., 100 Dey Road, Wayne, NJ 07470 for two high speed Phantom V2512 color cameras. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The FBI is often faced with questions from the law enforcement and intelligence communities regarding the effects of improvised explosives. An extremely efficient method of directly visualizing and analyzing the detailed formation and development of shock waves and their interactions is to use a high-speed camera. Capturing the details of the detonation event on video also provides a backup measurement of detonation velocity that is currently being measured with piezoelectric pins. If the pins malfunction during the detonation the results from the camera can be directly used to determine the detonation velocity.</p>
<p>The Vision Research Phantom V2512 Color camera would provide the FBI with a dedicated high-speed camera to accomplish the task of capturing the details of the detonation event of an improvised explosive on video. This capability will add greater flexibility in terms of answering time-sensitive requests, as well as provide the FBI the ability to visually evaluate the effects of changing testing parameters, such as mixture ratios, and being able to visually represent the results.</p>
<p>Vision Research is the sole manufacturer and distributer of the Phantom 2512 high-speed camera system. The FBI must have the ability to directly capture a detonation event using high-speed videography in order to accurately develop a behavior profile for improvised explosive devices. In order to accomplish this requirement and to properly measure this essential parameter, the Phantom 2512 from Vision Research is the only high-speed camera that will meet the requirements of the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements - See attached Sole-Source Justification</strong></p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, January 12, 2016, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contracting Officer, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with Physio-Control, Inc., 11811 Willows Rd NE, Redmond, WA, 98052-2003 for the purpose of procuring a technical service agreement for its existing Physio Control LifePak 15's.
<p>THRU requires a service agreement for its existing Physio Control LifePak 15's based on mission requirements and unit expansion. THRU has identified that continued fully functional Physio Control LifePak 15's are a continued need. The LifePak 15 will allow THRU paramedics to perform vital signs, Electrocardiograms, Defibrillation and Cardioversion. THRU has determined that these units are needed because the combination of the ability to monitor vital signs and perform ECG, Defibrillation and Cardioversion, combined with advanced medical training, ensures mission operability and continuous personnel safety. To be able to continue to have these capabilities requires a fully functioning LifePak 15. The purchase of the Physio Control LifePak 15 service agreement is essential to THRU as this will ensure that all LifePak 15 monitors are in full operational condition. This service agreement will make certain the mission of THRU is accomplished and will guarantee the safety of FBI personnel. In addition, to purchase new machines would incur significant cost that would be far greater than the price of the service contract. The required maintenance is below.</p>
<p>&bull; A one year Service Agreement for routine, preventive and needed maintenance of the LifePak 15 monitors.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Physio-Control, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and seller of their products and is the only authorized vendor to perform maintenance/service on their products. Any other vendor performing maintenance/service on the Physio Control products would void the FBI existing warranty with Physio Control, Inc.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, limited source, fixed price contract with Hamilton Robotics, Inc., 4970 Energy Way Reno, Nevada for the purpose of procuring a preventative maintenance and service contract for its existing Hamilton Robotics Workstations.
<p>The Nuclear DNA Unit (nDNAU) has two (2) existing Hamilton Robotic Workstation Systems, which is a high-capacity, high-throughput system designed to extract 96 samples at a time, as well as perform quantification and amplification set-up using commercially available chemical methods. The Hamilton Robotic System is the only automated instrument that can be programmed for multiple extraction chemistries at the same time. The Hamilton Robotic System is also the only automated instrument that can be used for all three steps of the DNA Casework Unit (DCU) process on the same platform: extraction, quantification set-up, and amplification set-up. An added benefit of the Hamilton Robotic System/software customization package is the ability to accommodate commercially available kits that should become available in the future as well as the ability to adapt to evolving needs of the DCU. In order to have these instruments in service for casework, regular maintenance and timely service repairs are not only necessary to obtain reliable results but also required by accrediting forensic organizations. In addition, Field Verification evaluations of each instrument are necessary to ensure that the instruments are performing properly. The maintenance and field verification evaluation requirements are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; A one year Service Maintenance Contract with a target response time of 24 hours and guaranteed response time of 48 hours for a down instrument, a guaranteed call back time of 4 hours, 2 PM's per year, and all parts, travel and labor.<br />&bull; Field Verification II Evaluations of each instrument using gravimetric and photometric measurements to ensure accuracy and precision of the instrument.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Hamilton Robotics, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these workstations and customized software; therefore, they are the only authorized manufacturer to provide maintenance and repair of these instruments.</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, limited source, fixed price contract with Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, California for the purpose of procuring a service agreement for its existing MiSeq FGx instruments and server.
<p>DSU is in the process of evaluating NGS instruments and technologies in order to support the FBI Laboratory's DNA program activities by advancing the technologies applied to DNA casework and expanding the range of specimens from which probative data can be recovered.

Now that NGS has been established as a worthy technology for future DNA casework application, and in order for DSU to continue its evaluation of the Illumina platform, a maintenance contract for the MiSeq FGx instruments and associated server is required. The contract will ensure that software updates, preventive maintenance needs, instrument failures, instrument upgrades, and other necessary items are addressed in a timely and cost-effective manner. This will in turn ensure that instrument testing can progress unhindered. The maintenance/service requirements are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; Service Agreement for 2 MiSeq FGx instruments<br />&bull; Service Agreement for FGx Server<br />&bull; Coverage to include all parts and labor<br />&bull; 1 Preventative Maintenance service visit per year<br />&bull; Adequate and timely on-site response/support when necessary</p>

Agency Contact Information: Acquisition Services Directorate Interior Business Center Department of the Interior 381 Elden Street, Suite 4000, Herndon, VA 20170 

ATTN:  Sheila Johnson, Sheila_johnsonmontalvan@ibc.doi.gov 

Place of Performance: Washington, DC 

The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Markets, a subsidiary of the Financial Times Ltd.  This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate on the behalf of the Department of Commerce/SelectUSA.

Description of Requirement: 

Background:  SelectUSA, established by Executive Order of the President and located within the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), is a U.S. Government-wide effort to encourage, facilitate, and accelerate business investment in the U.S. by both domestic and foreign firms - a major engine of economic growth and job creation.  SelectUSA provides enhanced coordination to existing resources and functions within DOC and across all federal departments and agencies with operations relevant to business investment. It also works with states, regional and local economic development organizations to promote and facilitate overall U.S. business attraction, retention and reshoring.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major economic driver of globalization, accounting for over half of all cross border investments. Nearly $1 trillion in Greenfield investment was announced by companies in 2008, creating almost 3 million jobs in their overseas subsidiaries. Companies are rapidly globalizing through FDI to serve new markets and customers, map out their value chains in the most efficient locations globally, and to access technological and natural resources. To promote the United States as the world's premier business location, SelectUSA requires access to a comprehensive, global, web-based FDI service that also provides current data regarding recently announced Greenfield FDI deals in the States, and early warning signals that a company may be considering investment to identify new business opportunities.

Objective: 
The web-based FDI database must provide current and comprehensive data to SelectUSA to:
	Research individual foreign-owned companies that have invested in the United States
	Organize these companies by industry sector, country of origin, investment destination, among other categories
	Track the USD($) value (real and estimated) of announced Greenfield investments
	Track the number (real and estimated) of announced greenfield investment projects
	Track the quantity of new jobs produced (real and estimated) from announced Greenfield investment projects
	Use investment data to help SelectUSA determine priority markets and industry sectors for job-creating investment attraction efforts
	Use investment data to advise economic development organizations on trends by company, industry sector, and geographic location to assist with activity prioritization efforts.
	Use investment data to assist economic development organizations in determining investment targeting and outreach activities for investment attraction and job creation.
	Track early-warning signals that a company may be considering investment before it has decided where to invest, to help SelectUSA stay ahead of the curve in identifying new business investment opportunities

This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13, only one responsible source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein. The period of performance for this effort will be one year and may include four one year option periods. 

The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 9 am EST, Friday, January 22, 2016.  Please be advised that it is the offeror's responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date. Submissions shall be sent electronically to Sheila Johnson, Contracts Specialist, at Sheila_johnsonmontalvan@ibc.doi.gov.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). This notice of intent applies to one single action.
<p>The Government has a requirement described below that has been supported under our Global Battlestaff and Program Support (GBPS) contracts since 2010. This requirement was scheduled to be among the first/original requirements to transition to our SOF-Wide Mission Support (SWMS) Group A contracts. Due to an extended acquisition timeline and multiple protests, SWMS Group A is not yet available. The contracted services described below are mission critical and this support cannot lapse. As such, the Government intends to issue a purchase order to bridge this critical support for a period of 6 months allowing the SWMS Group A contracts to clear protests. The purchase orders will be issued under NAICS 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>The requirement is:</p>
<p>Logistics Support Services. The purchase order will be issued to CAC-WGI, Inc., 302 Knights Run Ave, STE 950, Tampa Fl 33602-5936. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $437K.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within seven days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A change in the strategy detailed above based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to sole source to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for the continuing development, maintenance, and support of IT applications initially developed by UCLA in Phase One of the Veterans Administration (VA) research project entitled Effective Screening for Pain. We believe they are the only vendor capable of providing the required services and they are the only vendor approved by the VA to store data collected for this study.
A draft of the Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.
If you believe that your company is capable of providing the required services in the SOW, then please provide your information to greg.evans3@va.gov by January 15, 2016.
Please note that small business contractors must comply with the limitations in subcontracting clause, which requires the prime contractor to perform at least 50% of the work. The Government will not make an award to a small business concern that intends to subcontract the services to a large business and is simply acting as a "pass through". Please demonstrate in your response your capabilities showing that your company is capable of providing at least 50% of the work.

An estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 2.7 million neonatal deaths and 303,000 maternal deaths occur globally each year, signaling a major gap in interventions specifically around childbirth and the early postnatal period - a time when mothers and babies are most vulnerable and global progress in reducing mortality has been particularly poor. This gap in interventions is particularly acute in poor, underserved communities and among women who are disadvantaged.<br /><br /><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Innovative ideas that can leapfrog conventional approaches to address inequities and inequalities of care are critical in surmounting these gaps. If we are to accelerate substantial and sustainable progress in reducing maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths at the community level- and contribute to the goals and targets of Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality and the Every Newborn Action Plan - we need to foster and scale innovative prevention and treatment approaches across three domains:<br /><br />(1) Science &amp; technology;<br />(2) Service delivery; and<br />(3) Demand-side innovation that empowers pregnant women, their families, and their communities to practice healthy behaviors and be aware of and access health care during pregnancy, childbirth and the early postnatal period, especially the first two days after birth.<br /><br /><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">We are particularly interested in investing in and supporting approaches that integrate the latest behavior change approaches with scientific and/or technological advances and service delivery platforms into radical solutions for widespread impact on maternal and newborn health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We encourage these ideas that integrate scientific / technological, social and business innovation to foster sustainability.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<CONTACT>Lisa A. Fisher, Contracts Manager, Phone 843.760.3356, Email lisa.fisher@scra.org
<DESC>The National Shipbuilding Research Program Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP ASE) is interested in receiving abstracts describing potential project ideas which involve technologies or process improvements that accomplish the mission of the NSRP. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy ships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers - these solutions include leverage of best commercial practices, use of new technologies and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Successful projects are those that: incorporate aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards, demonstrate value, and clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is posted on the NSRP and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) websites. It will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in government and/or industry priorities.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted request for information</p>

The offeror is solely responsible for the performance of all inspection, tests requirements and quality control. The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7 Alternate I, System for Award Management; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. The government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
Price and Past Performance. 

1)	Price: 
The price quote will be evaluated separately from the other factors.  A contract will be awarded to the Vendor who has submitted the lowest price technically acceptable. Quotes will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing. Options: the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
2)	Past Performance:

The Vendors shall provide contract information of maximum three (3) relevant services currently being performed, completed or performed within five (5) years of the combined synopsis-solicitation release date. The service should be similar or greater in size, scope, magnitude and complexity to this acquisition.

Past performance will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the following ratings:

Acceptable: Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offerors performance record is unknown.
Unacceptable:  Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, unknown shall be considered acceptable.
The Government may consider past performance information from other sources such as: offeror's former customers, business associates, Federal, state, and local government agencies; the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, and Contracting Officers.
The offerors are requested to use the Past Performance format in order to submit the information regarding this evaluation factor.

If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply:<br /><br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each Offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br /><br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide Offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the auction process.<br /><br />(c) Prior to conducting the reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the Offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br /><br />(d) Unless auction instructions indicate that only Offeror's rankings will be displayed, the lowest Offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other Offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each Offeror's identity will be concealed from other Offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each Offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced Offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, Offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other Offerors, during the reverse auction.<br /><br />(e) An Offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final price proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.<br /><br />(f) The following requirements apply when the Government uses a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction:<br /><br />(1) Each Offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the Offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.<br /><br />(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such Offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and&nbsp; conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.<br /><br />(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other Offeror's pricing in confidence until after contract award.<br /><br />(4) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the<br />solicitation, the "Not Lead" Offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award if their final price in the auction is the tie offer price. If evaluation factors in addition to price were listed in the solicitation, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated in accordance with those evaluation factors.<br /><br />(5) Any Offerors unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the Offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the Offeror and outside the Offeror's control.<br /><br />(6) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.<br /><br />(7) Training:<br /><br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to Offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br /><br />(ii) An employee of an Offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a "Trained Offeror." Only Trained Offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that Offerors provide an alternate Offeror employee to become a Trained Offeror. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the Trained Offeror's designation from any Trained Offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:<br />Submit quotes by email (preferred) to: Nicholas.Moore@dla.mil no later than January 21st, 2016 at 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time.&nbsp; Attention should be noted to FAR 52.212-1(f), concerning late submissions.&nbsp; The offeror bears the risk of non-reciept of any email transmissions, and should ensure that all pages of the quote have been received by the designated office before the deadline indicated. Quotes may also be mailed to:<br /><br />DLA Disposition Services<br />ATTN: Nicholas Moore (J7)<br />74 N. Washington Ave.<br />Battle Creek, MI 49037<br /><br />Offerors shall provide the applicable CAGE code and DUNS number with their bid submission. The information located in FAR 52.212-3 (Offerors Representations and Certifications) shall be current on SAM.gov at the time of quote submission.<br /><br />QUOTE EVALUATION:<br />Award will be made to the contractor whose quote conforms to the solicitation, is deemed technically acceptable, and has the lowest price. &nbsp;A pass/fail technical review will be completed to assess the technical acceptability of the quotes. Determination of technical acceptability will be based off meeting or exceeding all of the requirements outlined in Section 2.0 of the Specifications.&nbsp; The quote shall demonstrate how each of the requirements in Section 2.0 will be met in order to be determined technically acceptable.&nbsp; Specification or product information sheets from the manufacturer shall be submitted for each requirement to ensure technical acceptability of the truck scale.&nbsp; Any quote that is missing a specification or product information sheet for a particular requirement may be determined technically unacceptable and may no longer be considered for award.&nbsp; All CLINs shall be priced to be considered for award.&nbsp; The total CLIN prices (including optional CLINs 0003 and 0004) will be evaluated prior to award.<br /><br /><br />

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Cassandra Lawrence, at cassandra.p.lawrence.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>The Contractor shall NOT make partial line item shipments against any resulting purchase order/contract issued as a result of this solicitation; e.g., if a line item on the contract reads - Computer, 10 each, the contractor shall NOT ship 3 computers on one shipment and 7 computers on a second shipment.  Failure to adhere to this requirement will result in invoices being rejected in WAWF and/or a delay in payment for non-conforming shipped quantities. <BR> <BR>SAM  Requirement - Company must be registered on System for Award Management (SAM) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in SAM, they may do so by going to SAM web site at http://www.sam.gov <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (CONtinental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 90 days, after submission.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii)	The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2016-23 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii)	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85-1/01-04-2016.<br /> Business size standard: other than small with 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(iv)	A notice regarding any set-aside restrictions, the associated NAICS code 325199- Chemical Manufacturing - All other basic organic chemical Manufacturing</p>
<p>(v)	Stereochemistry of lead compounds and Synthesis of lead compounds</p>
<p>(vi)	Background  <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways. First, our quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique. Second, NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define and assess new biology. This focus is reflected in our unprecedented outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS. Third, NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of translational science, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms.  Ultimately, NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in order to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve people's lives. Included in this process is the development of unique biological discoveries into potential pharmaceuticals which can greatly assist patients.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

4. The following questions were submitted in response to this RFP; the Government's "Answers" are provided below:
QUESTIONS	ANSWERS

Does the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation under solicitation VA244-15-R-0411 contain requirements similar to a current contract?

If possible, please provide the current contract number. Or, is this a new requirement for the government? 
	
Yes, the current contract contains similar requirements. 


This is not a new requirement for the government. Awarded contracts can be viewed on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).



Would this RFP/Solicitation be open to an IPA?	
The VA does not award contracts to Third Party entities. This is not a clinical contract which calls for any clinical services that would require a physician group or service to determine pricing. This is a delivery service which is further defined in the SOW of the contract. 


The items listed for a proposal price seem to be service related; are you looking for a proposal on DME setup?
	
Each item listed for proposal price is listed in detail in Section B.4.5 Performance Work Tasks, page 9 of RFP. Each task listed in section B.4.5 corresponds with the line items in section B.5 Price/Cost Schedule, page 20 of RFP. Example - Item 0001 is explained in detail in Task 1, Item 0002 with Task 2, and so on. 


Is there a set fee schedule for the items delivered (i.e. Medicare or Medicaid related fee schedule)?
	
Through market research of other facilities that hold similar DME contracts, other vendor have been able to determine if a proposal is within a reasonable range.


?

Who currently has both of these contracts?	
Klingensmith, Inc. is servicing Butler and Health Aid of Ohio is currently servicing Pittsburgh.


Is the vendor required to have a location in both Butler and Pittsburgh or can the vendor have one location that services both VA?	
The vendor is NOT required to have a storage facility located in both Butler and Pittsburgh. One storage facility to meet the requirements stated in the RFP is sufficient.


5. The HOUR and DATE proposals are due remain unchanged at January 15, 2015; 1:00 P.M. E.S.T.
6. Offerors are reminded "Failure to acknowledge receipt of this amendment may result in rejection of your offer.

_____________________________________________________

This OFFICIAL synopsis/solicitation is for a firm-fixed-price multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) enterprise contract to satisfy an ongoing need at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) enterprise level to procure or lease Multifunctional Devices (MFDs).  This will fulfill VA's printing, copying, and scanning needs (including installation, configuration, training, and standard one-year commercial warranty support and maintenance) by offering eight unique MFD configurations for purchase or lease.  This acquisition is required in order to provide VA organizations with an efficient means of replacing and/or refreshing its MFD inventory that is at or approaching its end-of-life.  Establishment of a multiple-award ID/IQ enterprise vehicle will enable any VA organization to quickly and efficiently acquire current generation MFDs to meet its minimum MFD requirements.  

The IDIQ contract will consist of a single 2-year ordering period.  This will be a competitive acquisition and a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  VA intends to make up to three awards and reserves the right to make additional awards if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is anticipated to be 334118.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-16-R-0882 (previously issued as a Request For Information under ID# VA118-15-N-0225 and cancelled solicitation #VA118-15-R-0257 and VA118-15-R-0395).  The final synopsis/solicitation was released on December 9, 2015 with a closing date (as of A00006) of January 19, 2016 at 8:00AM EST.  The Point of Contact for this effort is Samantha Fletcher, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-440-9652, Email:  samantha.fletcher@va.gov.

<DESC>Amendment 05<br />The purpose of this Amendment 05 is to post questions and answers.<br />Q5. Are Large Companies allowed to join my proposal as a subcontractor?<br />A5. Yes. Please read the new clauses in Attachment E, especially FAR 52.219-14.
<p>Q6. Our company does not have a facility clearance but my subcontracting partner does. Will a submission be compliant where only the subcontractor has the facility clearance?<br />A6. Please read the posting above, repeated here:<br />Volume 1 - Security. This volume shall provide the Offeror's CAGE code identifying that the Prime Offeror has a TOP SECRET facility clearance and shall include the Offeror's Security Officer's contact information. Facilities Clearances will be validated through the Defense Security Service. The Government shall evaluate the Security factor on a "Pass/Fail" basis. If the Offeror does not receive a "Pass" in the Security Factor, the proposal will not be evaluated further.</p>
<p>Q7. Are completed Attachment E - Non Disclosure Agreement Forms required to be submitted in the DOMEX Proposal Response submission?<br />A7. No.</p>
<p>Q8. We request clarification of the data rights the government will receive in the work performed under this contract, as follows:<br />Paragraph 8 ("Data Rights") of the Combined Synopsis / Solicitation provides that the Government will receive "Government Purpose Rights to Technical Data and computer software developed and delivered" under the contract. Are we correct in assuming that the relevant FAR/DFAR provisions - i.e., FAR 52.227-14, DFAR 252.227-7013 and/or DFAR 252.227-2014 - will thus be added to the contract, and that DFAR 252.227-7020 (which currently appears in Attachment E to the SOW) will be deleted?<br />A8. The Government has revised Attachment E to include FAR 52.227-14 Rights in Data (General),  DFAR 252.227-2014 Rights in noncommercial computer software and nocommercial computer software documentation.  However DFAR 252.7020 Rights in Special Works will remain. DFAR 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data - Noncommercial is not applicable.</p>
<p>Q9. Is this a recompete contract? If so, on SITE? Other? Can you please clarify whether or not this opportunity is now being moved under the E-SITE contract?<br />A9. This is a recompete. It is not on SITE, other, or under E-SITE. Please read 3. under the Description, repeated here:<br />3. The Government contemplates a single award of a Time and Material contract type resulting from this solicitation, FAR Subpart 52.216-1, Contract Type of Contract (APR 1984).</p>
<p>Q10. I would like the opportunity to speak to you re: this opportunity. It appears that what you are looking for may be available in my current tool set, or derivatives.  Please let me know when you might have time to speak.<br />A10. Verbal communication with only one vendor is not permitted. Please review this posting. Oral questions/phone calls will not be considered. Any information provided by the contracting office concerning this solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective vendors in writing.</p>
<p>Q11. Does the Government anticipate that the contractor maintain a separate system in the contractor facility to support this effort?  If so, will the Government provide the system?  <br />A11. The contractor is expected to perform development and testing at the contractor's facility. No Government Furnished Equipment will be given to the contractor to complete this work. There is no expectation that the contractor will have an operational instance of the platform at the contractor's facility beyond the instance of the platform needed under this award.</p>
<p>Q12. Would the government consider switching to a different Platform and Triage system if that system provided significant capabilities of both the existing code and significant capabilities described as future RDT&amp;E efforts out of the box? <br />A12. The Government would consider switching platforms if the replacement platform met the capabilities of the existing platform, would meet the efforts outlined within the SOW, and is releasable as open source per the SOW section 3.</p>
<p>Q13. The formatting on the FBO website wasn't clear. For clarification, does the table below accurately reflect the Government's requirements for submission?<br />A13. Section 13 is provided as a separate attachment for clarity.</p>
<p>Q14. Section 13 states the following:<br />"Hard Copies: Each hard copy shall have a detailed table of contents to delineate the topics within that volume. Electronic: Each CD-ROM shall contain a detailed table of contents file to match the files on the CD. Folder/file names shall be named according to the table of contents to facilitate navigation."</p>
<p>Does the Government intend that each CD-ROM have a separate Table of Contents file which is a list of all of the files on the CD-ROM. For example:</p>
<p>CD-ROM for Volume 1 Table of Contents: <br />"Volume 1: Security and Contract Documentation.pdf" <br />"Volume 2: Technical and Management.pdf" <br />"Volume 3: Past Performance."</p>
<p>CD-ROM for Volume 2 Table of Contents:<br />"Technical and Management.pdf"<br />"Technical and Management.doc"</p>
<p>If so, what file format would the Government like the CD-ROM Table of Contents to be in?</p>
<p>A14. Yes, each CD-ROM should have a table of contents listing the content of that CD-ROM. The format of the table of contents may be Word or PDF.</p>
<p>Q15. What is the PPQ submission deadline?<br />A15. The deadline for the PPQ is the same as the proposal: noon on 21 January. The Govenment understands that the submission of the PPQ is not within the offeror's control; please communicate to those filling out the Past Performance Questionnaire that we will start evaluations on 21 January.</p>
<p>Q16. SOW attachment B2 identifies a contractor sample QASP provided for government consideration. Is the sample provided after contract award or should this be part of Vol. 2?<br />A16. The Government will post this sample shortly. Please do address the deliverables.</p>

<DESC>Please see the following answers to the questions that were received in response to the draft RFP:<br /><br />
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>SF-1449 - CLINX002 states that "the Contractor shall bill monthly for the kilograms handled each month." The proposal instructions, however, indicate that a firm fixed price should be provided for each CLIN. Please confirm the Government's intent based on the estimated quantities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the mail processing CLIN X002, it is the Government's intent for the contractor to submit monthly invoices based on the firm fixed price per kilogram and the kilograms actually processed.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The use of Fixed Unit Price seems appropriate for the variable nature of the effort provided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the government is requesting the contractor to take on significant fixed costs, both in facilities and personnel, to accomplish the requirements of the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without a guaranteed minimum value each month, the contractor will have to increase the costs to account for the risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, with a floor amount, the government could ensure the most competitive pricing from all bidders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recommend either adding a FP monthly component to cover these fixed costs or providing a minimum monthly volume guarantee.</p>
<p>Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has determined that guaranteeing a minimum monthly volume and or a CLIN to cover fixed costs is not a strategy we would like to pursue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The PWS contains historical records for the past several years to help convey the scope of this effort to industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One item that will likely change is the labeling of the CLIN quantities in Section B from "Not To Exceed" to "Estimate".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CLIN quantities actually represent the Government's estimate, rather than any kind of ceiling amount, as currently stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Section 5.4 - Are the subcontractors' past performance citations in addition to the required references or considered part of the total count? How many past performances should be submitted for each major subcontractor?</p>
<p>Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontractors' past performance citations are considered part of the total count.</p>
<p>4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Evaluation Criteria - Will the Government consider deviating the evaluation plan from LPTA? While LPTA is a valuable strategy to acquire simple, purely commoditized items, choosing a contractor who only meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation with a past performance that only provides reasonable expectation of success introduces unnecessary risk to the GAMT program. Based on the importance of this contract and the criticality of timely and accurate mail delivery to sustain the morale of our nation's troops, will the Government consider evaluation criteria that ranks technical capability and successful past performance ahead of price?</p>
<p>Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has considered all source selection types and feels that LPTA is the most appropriate for this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement is a well-defined, not technically complex, commercial service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has been contracting out this service for 13 years now and feels it is not in the Government's best interest to utilize a tradeoff source selection strategy.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><span>5.<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;</span></span></span>In the last years it was a requirement that only US companies could bid on the contract. We cannot find anything on this in the current RFP. Can you let us know, if we as German GMBH could take part.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt">Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement is not restricted to US companies.</p>

<p>Response:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be no handling of Registered Mail in this requirement.</p>

<p>Degraded Visual Environment Solution for Rotary Wing Aircraft</p>
<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION<br />We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of a Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Solution for Rotary Wing Aircraft.<br />Existing system capabilities do not provide adequate situational awareness of uncharted terrain/obstacles for safe flight operations in Degraded Visual Environments (DVE). Enroute DVE created by low visibility conditions can result in Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) or other manmade/natural obstacles. Takeoff and landing DVE created by rotorwash-induced brownout/whiteout conditions cause loss of visual reference with the ground/obstacles at low altitudes and airspeeds. Loss of visual reference during these critical phases of flight significantly increase the risk of dynamic rollover and hard landing that often results in aircraft damage/loss and/or personnel injury/death. A system is required to sense and display uncharted enroute and terminal area terrain/obstacles to enhance aircrew situational awareness for additional safety during DVE operations. <br />The DVE solution should meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; The system shall provide aircraft navigation/pilotage capabilities in both day and night DVE conditions. <br />&bull; Aircrew should be able to easily identify enroute hazards such as terrain, antennas, wires, and poles. Aircrew should be able to easily identify terminal area hazards such as poles, vehicles, fence posts, wires, ditches, berms, holes, and large rocks. <br />&bull; Precision approach/landing cues should command navigation to a landing point with no more than 5 kts forward velocity, zero aft velocity, and no more than 1 kt lateral drift. Cue commanded descent rate should not exceed 100 FPM at touchdown. <br />&bull; The system should detect and display wires at a minimum range of &ge;1 km, and should incorporate a Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) which will alert aircew of hazards based on terrain/obstacle databases and real time sensor data.<br />&bull; The system should integrate with existing HH-60G sensor, display, navigation, and flight management systems to the maximum extent practical.And shall not be mounted on the aircraft so as to cause or create damage when full aircraft weight is on ground.<br />&bull; The system shall be composed of line replaceable units (LRU) that are normalized in the Air Force supply system and replaceable at the organizational level.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY<br />Degraded Visual Environment Solution for Rotary Wing Aircraft</p>
<p>Part I. Business Information</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">UPDATE 07 January 2016: If interested in attending the USAICoE Industry Day or participating in a&nbsp;one-on-one meeting with the HTASC team, please submit your request no later than Monday, 11 JANUARY 2016, 12:00 PM EST. Accordingly,&nbsp;"USAICoE INDUSTRY DAY" section updated below.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as the Huachuca Training and Support Contract (HTASC). This SSN is associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC.</p>
<p>Potential NAICS for HTASC: 611430 Professional and Management Development Training.</p>
<p>Based on the requirements, the Government is considering a single award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government has provided a DRAFT HTASC "common"/basic Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN) along with several additional DRAFT PWSs that may be Task Orders under the HTASC single award IDIQ contract if this was determined to be the best acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle (or multiple contract vehicles) capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy to generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the Performance Work Statements (PWSs) provided. Questions received will be consolidated, answered and, if deemed valuable information for all interested parties, will be posted at a later date on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAICoE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. The majority of USAICoE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new HTASC.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of USAICoE's WFF/SETA requirements (previously discussed under the Special Notice/RFI for HTASC) will be supported by other contract vehicles (to be announced through separate FBO announcements) allowing the Government to focus HTASC's scope on USAICoE's core mission: Military Intelligence training. Requirements anticipated to be outside of HTASC include:</p>
<p>- USAICoE Chief Information Office (CIO) - G6;<br />- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) - Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0024; and<br />- Knowledge Based Assistance and Advisory Services to include: USAICoE Knowledge Management Office; USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO); USAICoE Safety requirement; and USAICoE Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC).</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Please submit all responses (and any other written correspondence) to the following email inbox (the size limitation is 20MB) with email Subject: "HTASC Sources Sought Notice Response". <br /><br />usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.htasc@mail.mil</p>

Describe your firm's applicable capabilities related to the enclosed PWSs and related past performance (to include contract name/number, customer name/contract information, period of performance, and a brief description of the related services). Past performance should be recent (meaning contract is ongoing, or, if the contract has ended, the contract end date shall be no more than three years prior to this SSN posting date). Firms can provide verbatim language from the HTASC RFI #1 submission as needed.</p>
<p>Section II. The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc. Describe your firm's perspective on effective strategies for satisfying this requirement, focusing on real-world and/or conceptual solutions and relevant lessons learned that address the Government's HTASC requirements.

<p>1. The Government may narrow the HTASC scope to strictly instructors and training development requirements to allow a) industry to focus on USAICoE's core mission, Military Intelligence training, and b) provide more competitive opportunities to industry to support the other training support/professional services USAICoE requirements (to include, but not limited to, advisory/assistance services, USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO) support, Safety requirement support, and Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) support as described in the HTASC RFI #1). What is your firm's perspective regarding this acquisition strategy?</p>
<p>2. Is it your firm's intention to support HTASC as a prime contractor? If so, which requirements/tasks would your firm intend on supporting through subcontracts (if your firm is identified as a small business under one of the identified NAICS, please consider FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting)?</p>
<p>3. What would your firm consider an appropriate length of time for transition from the incumbent contract to the HTASC contract?</p>
<p>4. In general, are there specific portions of the Government's DRAFT requirements documentation that your firm feels need to be defined more clearly?</p>
<p>5. Do you feel the requirements are defined enough to allow for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, or, some FFP line items for specific tasks?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY AS DEFINED IN FAR 15.201(e). THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES - IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A PROMISE TO ISSUE AN RFP IN THE FUTURE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ISSUED IN SUPPORT OF MARKET RESEARCH, TO GATHER INFORMATION, AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCES.
<p><br />A. STATEMENT OF NEED</p>
<p>As further described below, the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) is interested in Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) contract support services in support of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS), to include (but not limited to) the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of sensors and systems, mission data collection, support to customers for missile and system testing, and space surveillance and object identification for the Warfighter. Additionally, contract support services are required to support activities at a control center in Huntsville, AL, known as the RTS Operations Center-Huntsville (ROC-H).</p>
<p>B. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>RTS</p>
<p>The RTS is an approved DoD Major Range and Test Facilities Base (MRTFB) that supports approved Department of Defense Military Service, Joint Forces, and commercial tests. As a MRTFB, RTS services primarily focus on Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.</p>
<p>RTS is a tenant organization on the U.S. Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), which is managed by the U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM). The U.S. Army leases 11 islands within Kwajalein Atoll from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) under a Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement (MUORA); the MUORA is part of the Compact of Free Association between the US and the RMI. RTS equipment, instrumentation and facilities are located on 8 of these 11 leased islands. Kwajalein Island and Roi Namur Island require 24 hour, 7 days a week contractor support of RTS mission operations. During test operations the RTS operational area expands to encompass an area with a radius of 500 nautical miles of both Kwajalein Island and Wake Island. Mission operations include radar, optics, telemetry, command and control, launch ordnance, calibration, voice and data communications, data collection/distribution, data reduction, and information services including intercontinental communications. Note that many of these capabilities are one of a kind in both their function and employment, and include both O&amp;M and Improvement and Modernization (I&amp;M).<br />RTS conducts mission operations in a split base configuration with data collection sensors and the secondary operations control center (KMCC - Kwajalein Mission Control Center) on the Kwajalein Atoll and the main operations control center at ROC-H.</p>
<p>Location/Demographics</p>
<p>Kwajalein Atoll is approximately 2,100 nautical miles west-southwest of Hawaii; it is a crescent loop of coral islands enclosing the world's largest lagoon (1,100 square miles). The atoll is 75 miles from Kwajalein Island (on the south reef) to Ebadon Island (northwest corner) and 15 miles west/east (at the widest point). Kwajalein Island is home to approximately 1,500 people and its population is a mix of DoD active duty (AD) personnel, Department of Army civilian (DAC) employees, and DoD contractor personnel and their family members. Roi-Namur Island is 50 miles north of Kwajalein Island and is home to approximately100 unaccompanied DoD contractor personnel. Meck Island is 20 miles north of Kwajalein Island, has no permanent residents, and is used primarily during missions as a launch site. Ebeye Island is 5 miles north of Kwajalein Island and is home to approximately 15,000 local nationals. Wake Island, which is approximately 700 miles north of Kwajalein Atoll, is utilized by RTS test customers and is supported during test activities on a campaign basis.</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>RTS is a remote location with limited travel options. Currently, only the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command and United Airlines service Kwajalein Atoll (both options require travel through Hawaii). The minimum travel time from the Continental United States (CONUS) is two days. Of note, the remote location increases the transportation costs and lengthens supply chain operations.</p>
<p>Corrosive Environment</p>
<p>Kwajalein Atoll is one of the most highly corrosive environments in the world. The salt content of the ocean and salt spray causes most metals (including stainless steel) to begin to oxidize within a matter of weeks. This environment results in a significant cost consideration as equipment refreshment rate and maintenance costs are substantial.</p>
<p>Host Nation Infrastructure</p>
<p>The RMI is a developing nation. The neighboring islands do not have adequate infrastructure to support the population currently residing on Kwajalein Island. Local and third country nationals reside on Ebeye Island and must transit through Kwajalein Island to reach the international flights operated by United Airlines. This island has a struggling infrastructure due to the dense population (.125 square miles or 80 acres in size; 5th most densely populated island in the world). Due to the limited infrastructure, USAG-KA houses and/or hosts all AD, DAC, and DoD contractor personnel, as well as selected local national personnel.<br />C.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: 16-R-05357.

AMENDMENT A004: Issued January 8, 2016 to replace Attachment 1 with Attachment 1R to update the SOW, Attachment 9R is replaced by Attachment 9R(a) to provide completion instructions, and GFE clauses have been added to the SIR.

The due date for receipt of proposals has not bee changed. 

AMENDMENT A003: Issued January 4, 2016 to replace Attachment 9 with Attachment 9R to correct the due date for receipt of Past Performance Questionnaires.

AMENDMENT A002: Issued December 23, 2015 to extend date for questions to January 6, 2016 and due date for proposals to January 21, 2016.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 21, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: 16-R-05357.

AMENDMENT A004: Issued January 8, 2016 to replace Attachment 1 with Attachment 1R to update the SOW, Attachment 9R is replaced by Attachment 9R(a) to provide completion instructions, and GFE clauses have been added to the SIR.

The due date for receipt of proposals has not been changed. 

AMENDMENT A003: Issued January 4, 2016 to replace Attachment 9 with Attachment 9R to correct the due date for receipt of Past Performance Questionnaires.

AMENDMENT A002: Issued December 23, 2015 to extend date for questions to January 6, 2016 and due date for proposals to January 21, 2016.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 21, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, connie.m.houpt@faagov, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, January 21, 2016.  


Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, January 21, 2016, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

The ability to ensure data completeness associated with each specimen required a coordinated effort across numerous institutions and information systems. This coordination will become increasingly difficult and important as the program triples the number of tumor types in the coming five (5) years. The purpose of the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to collect, analyze, review, store and distribute the data associated with CPTAC.</span></p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies.

<DESC>This solicitation has been cancelled in its entirety due to the Government requirements changing.<br /><br /><br />The Norfolk District, Army Corps of Engineers is contemplating a Firm Fixed Price, Design-Build Construction contract for the construction of a new combined heat and power plant (CHPP) at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), Radford, Virginia. <br /><br />Background - <br /><br />There is a need for the Army to replace the circa 1941 powerhouse with a modern combined heat and power plant (CHPP) at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, Radford, Virginia (RFAAP) due to current facility infrastructure passing economically useful life creating an unacceptable risk of impact to plant operations and the requirement of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT), issued on 31 January 2013 as part of 40 CFR Part 63 of the Clean Air Act, mandating all major air emitting sources meet more stringent Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emission standards. The Government has determined it is not economically justifiable to retrofit advance air emission control measures into the existing power plant. <br /><br />RFAAP is a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) energetic materials manufacturing facility established in 1941. RFAAP is the principal domestic source of propellants for small, medium, and large caliber ammunition and some missiles. <br /><br />The intended contract action is for the award of a contract for full design-build services to design, construct, test, commission, and train new operating staff for a new CHPP that can generate 16 megawatts of electricity and 460,000 lbs/hour of superheated steam. Associated equipment/spaces include but are not limited to the following: natural gas fired combustion turbines, dual fuel (natural gas and fuel oil) steam boilers, emergency/black start reciprocating generator, steam turbine(s), compressed air system, boiler feed water systems, chilled water system, brine maker, electrical switchgear, electrical substation, monitoring and control systems, emissions control systems, control room and administrative spaces. <br /><br />This project will be solicited as unrestricted following a two-phase best value procurement process in accordance with FAR Part 15 and 36.3. The contracting officer will award a firm fixed price contract to the responsible offeror in accordance with FAR 9.1, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and offers the best overall value to the Government, determined through a two phase evaluation. The factors for Phase 1 are anticipated to consist of the following: Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization, Technical Approach, and Key Personnel. The Phase 2 evaluation is anticipated to consist of price and the following non-price factors: Power Generation and Emissions Performance Guarantees, Design Concepts, Quality of Materials, Schedule, Key Subcontractors, and Small Business Participation. <br /><br />The magnitude of construction is between $50,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 237130, Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million. <br /><br />Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data <br />obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror. <br /><br />The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available. Other methods of requesting a package will not be honored. This solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov on/about February 13, 2015.

<DESC><p>The work described herein involves the replacement/upgrade of the navigation lock downstream gate hoist mechanical machinery and the associated electrical and control equipment, and the rehabilitation of the gate hoist friction sheaves.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Ice Harbor navigation lock downstream gate is a counterbalanced vertical lift gate and measures approximately 90 feet tall by 88 feet wide and weighs approximately 740 tons. The gate is connected to two counterweights (one on each side) with twelve 2-1/4 inch diameter wire ropes. The hoist machinery is located in two machinery rooms located at the top of the downstream structural towers, one on each side of the lift gate. The wire ropes pass over an 18 foot diameter friction sheave. The friction sheave is driven through an electric hydraulic pump driving a high speed hydraulic motor. The speed is reduced and torque increased through a gearbox having an external pinion driving the gear around the perimeter of the sheave. The wire rope passes over the uppermost surface of the hoist sheave. The two hoist sheaves support the cumulative weight of the gate, the counterweight, and the hoist ropes.</p>
<p>The downstream lift gate hoist machinery is the original machinery installed when the lock was placed into service in 1969, with the exception of a coupling (replaced in 1980), pedestal mounting system (added in 1980), output gear in box (reversed due to bent shaft in 1980), gearboxes and hydraulic system (replaced in 1989), hoist wire ropes (replaced in 2012). Electrical and control systems are original.</p>
<p>Summary of Work</p>
<p>Mechanical upgrades consist of the hoist drive components required to operate the gate, the overhead service crane in each machinery room, and the mechanical aspects of limits and controls for gate operation.</p>
<p>Furnish and install the following items for the hoist drives in each machinery room: new pillow block bearings, ring gears, pinion gears, pinion shafts, pinion bearings, couplings, and brakes. In addition, install new Government furnished gearboxes.</p>
<p>Install new bearings and ring gear for the friction sheaves in each machinery room. In order to replace the friction sheave bearings and ring gears, the contractor must have technical experience, labor, and physical plant required for jacking and shoring of the existing 18 foot diameter friction sheaves that weigh approximately 112,000 pounds each and the counterweights which weigh approximately 740,000 pounds each. Upon completion of the bearing replacement, the contractor will be responsible for precise alignment of the friction sheave bearings and the alignment of open gear contact between the new pinion gears and the existing friction sheave ring gears.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous elements of the contract include RCRA 8 metal based paint and asbestos containing material (ACM) removal and disposal from existing equipment, and reroofing both tower roofs with a liquid applied membrane.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for gate hoist wire rope load balancing that will require the services of a qualified engineer with a minimum of three years experience with load cells and load monitoring equipment to ensure the loads are evenly distributed across all hoist wire ropes at the completion of the work. The overhead service cranes in each machinery room will be replaced with commercially-available four ton rated electric wire rope hoists. New overhead cranes shall be single-girder top running bridge-type furnished with pendant style pushbutton remote control and wall-mounted pushbutton control station. Structural upgrades consist of weld repair of the downstream gate hoist friction sheaves, fabrication and installation of new machinery supports and pedestals, fabrication and installation of new safety handrails, and structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels.</p>
<p>Structural modifications to the existing overhead service crane corbels consist of the installation of an adhesive anchor system to increase the load capacity of the corbels from 5,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds. Evaluate concrete drilling locations for the presence of existing reinforcing steel with Ground Penetrating Radar or an approved equivalent method. Electrical upgrades consist of replacement of the machinery room motor control centers and power supply wiring and circuit breakers, installation of new variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped motors, new main power disconnects, new power distribution blocks, new VFD's, new control voltage transformers, new dynamic brake resistors, new programmable logic controllers (PLC), new network switches, new fiber optic panels, and new control relays.</p>
<p>New PLC installations require the contractor to provide PLC program development, licensed software packages, shop testing, and operator field tests. New VFD installations require specified hardware, programming software, onsite installation supervision by the VFD manufacturer, VFD test plans, and execution of performance verification tests.</p>
<p>New control panel, graphic panel, and equipment panel installations require specified hardware to be verified through Government-witnessed shop testing prior to delivery to the work site. A critical element of the project involves complex sequencing and coordination of commissioning and cut-over of new equipment and systems, and highly technical interfaces between new and old systems. The Contractor must demonstrate experience and qualifications necessary to manage challenging Quality Control and Commissioning programs for both factory and on-site testing requirements. The project involves long lead time procurement of complex electrical and control equipment and fabrication of large mechanical gears. Complete on-site work in close coordination with the Government lock and dam facility, and minimize outages and disruptions to operations.</p>

<p><br />19. PARKS INFORMATION</p>
<p>A. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND FOR CHARBONNEAU &amp; FISHHOOK PARKS</p>
<p>Ice Harbor Lock and Dam was named for an ice-free cove just upstream from the location of the dam. Steamboat captains used the cove as a safe place to wait out the winter without danger from ice. The Dam is located on the lower Snake River approximately ten miles from its confluence with the Columbia River. The waters of Lake Sacajawea now cover the cove. The lake was named for the Shoshone Indian women who accompanied the Lewis and Clark expedition in their search for the easiest route to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Ice Harbor Lock and Dam and Lake Sacajawea are located on the lower Snake River in Walla Walla and Franklin Counties, near the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers in southeastern Washington. The dam is 9.7 miles above the mouth of the Snake River, which enters the Columbia River at River Mile 324. Lake Sacajawea is the downstream unit of the series of four impoundments authorized for the development of slack water navigation on the lower Snake River, extending from the head of Lake Wallula to the vicinity of Lewiston, Idaho. Ice Harbor Lock and Dam is 2,822 feet long, and 100 feet high. It is of the concrete gravity type, with an earth-fill embankment section at the north abutment. It was a ten-bay spillway 590 feet long, and ten 50-foot tainter gates. Lake Sacajawea, when full, extends northeast thirty-two (32) miles upstream to Lower Monumental Dam, and has a surface area of 9,200 acres</p>
<p>Summers are generally very dry with abundant sunshine and maximum temperatures averaging near 90 degrees. There are days with temperatures in excess of 100 degrees, but the low summer humidity reduces the impact from the heat. Cliffs and rounded basalt bluffs predominate along the 32 mile length of Lake Sacajawea. These high rugged features are created by the down cutting action of the Snake River through the layers of basalts and other lava-derived materials that underlie the Columbia Plateau. Thus, the reservoir lies at the bottom of a gorge entrenched within grain fields, vineyards, orchards and dry land pasture of the plateau uplands.</p>

<p>D. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND FOR HOOD PARK <br />Lake Wallula is the reservoir which lies behind McNary Lock and Dam and came into existence in 1957. Lake Wallula begins at Columbia River Mile (RM) 292.5 and extends 64 miles upstream. The lake shoreline extends past McNary Beach, Hat Rock State Park, and Warehouse Beach, through the Wallula Gap, past the confluence of the Walla Walla River and Sacajawea State Park and the confluence of the Snake River, through the Tri-Cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, and to the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site, located approximately twenty-seven miles upstream of Pasco. Lake Wallula also extends ten miles up the Snake River to Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Lake Wallula has a water surface area of 38,800 acres, with 242 miles of shoreline, and a normal operating range between 340 and 335 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>Lake Wallula is a diverse area. The 16,908 acres surrounding the lake are public lands used for recreational, wildlife habitat, wildlife mitigation, and water-connected industrial development. Approximately 2,400 acres are licensed either to State or local park agencies, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service owns and manages approximately 3,500 acres of public lands as part of the McNary National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The Wallula Gap (near Pasco) is one of the most significant natural features in the story of the Ice Age floods. All the floodwaters from glacial Lake Missoula after having spread out over hundreds of miles of the Channeled Scabland were funneled through this single narrow opening only a few miles wide. During Ice-Age floods more water entered the Gap than could pass through, so the water backed up. Behind the bottleneck, floodwater rose to an elevation of 1,250 feet, almost a thousand feet above present river level. This forced floodwaters up the Yakima and Walla Walla river valleys, submerging Yakima and Walla Walla under hundreds of feet of water and backwater rose to almost a thousand feet over Richland.</p>
<p>Surrounding ridgelines tell tales of the unique geology and cataclysmic forces that shaped the Columbia Basin. Treeless mountains (Badger Mountain, Rattlesnake Mountain, and Red Mountain) rise from the earth, great basalt remnants of the Ice Age floods. The Ice-Age floods' impact is also evident in the sediment layers at White Bluffs, in the unique vegetation of the shrub steppe, and in Columbia River bars. The basalt and lava landscape was carved by the great Ice-Age Floods.</p>
<p>E. HOOD PARK - INFORMATION SHEET</p>
<p>Hood Park, in Eastern Washington, is on Lake Wallula, formed by McNary Lock and Dam on the Washington/Oregon border. The park is three miles south of Pasco, Washington. From Pasco take U.S. Highway 12 East. After crossing the Snake River Bridge, take the first off ramp at the junction of State Route 124. Cross over the bridge and the park entrance is 65 yards on the left side of the road. Physical address: Hood Park, 592 Camp Circle, Burbank, Washington. This is not a mailing address.</p>
<p>Hood Park has sixty-seven (67) fee collection campsites, all campsites are paved, and have electric hookups. All campsites are reservable. The camp-ground has a dump station, showers/restrooms, and playground. Each site has a fire pit/grill, picnic table, and is surrounded by green grass with mature shade trees scattered throughout the area. There is a day-use area next to the campground which includes grills, tables, horseshoe pits, basketball court, nature trails, swimming area, boat ramp, and a large group shelter. Pay phones are available in both the campground, and day-use areas. There is also a wildlife refuge next to the park which provides habitat for migration, waterfowl, bald eagles, shoreline birds, and other resident wildlife. There are fishing ponds in the habitat area.</p>
<p>F. LOCAL AREA</p>
<p>All the parks are convenient to the Tri-Cities where there are shopping malls, a semi-pro baseball team, and wineries. Ice Harbor Lock &amp; Dam, located near Charbonneau Park has a visitor center, with fish viewing. There is also a wildlife refuge near in Burbank, which provides habitat for migrating, waterfowl, bald eagles, shoreline birds, and other resident wildlife.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Correspondence Engine Notification (CEN) project will support VA's long-term vision by providing secure, timely, and convenient communications to Veterans based on their preferred communication channel, whether electronic, mobile, or mail.  The CEN delivery model will be Software As A Service (SaaS), which will provide an Application Programming Interface (API) to integrate with existing VBA systems.  CEN envisions all requirements hosting, platforms, any other infrastructure) service costs will be bundled within a single procurement for VA, but also is willing to explore hosting some parts or all on VA hosting services.  Ultimately, CEN will help reduce the VBA claims backlog by providing Veterans with timely access and the ability to respond to requests for additional data on a timely basis.

During the SOW development phase of the Reconstruction IDIQ, USAID identified alternative approaches to rebuild vital infrastructure after a disaster or emergency. Therefore, USAID has decided not to pursue a global Reconstruction IDIQ at this time, and instead will focus its resources to utilize existing mechanisms and build internal USAID capacity for reconstruction planning and procurement.</span>

<DESC>See Procurement Type:&nbsp; Fair Opportunity / Limited Sources Justification<br />Title:&nbsp; JEFO Sole Source 30 Day Bridge<br /><br />The above JEFO posting explains the rationale for restricting competition for this 30 day bridge contract. Awarding a bridge contract for 30 days is necessary to provide continuity of Scientific, Engineering, and Technical Assistance (SETA) program management support for Product Director, Installation Information Infrastructure Modernization Program (PD I3MP) which is being performed in CONUS and OCOUS. The current task order with Engility expires 01/09/2016. A follow-on acquisition which will result in a suite of competitive awards to multiple small business contracts for Program Manager, Installation, Information, Infrastructure, Communications and Capabilities (PM I3C2) and its programs to include I3MP for the Enterprise Integration Technology Services (EITS) competition which is in process but is not expected to be awarded until 02/08/2015. Pending the award of these EITS contracts, there is no recourse other than to award a bridge contract for 30 days for the extension of services with the incumbent contractor to provide continued support the PM I3MP SETA support services.
