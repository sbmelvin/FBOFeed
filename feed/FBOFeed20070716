Sole Source Justification

The Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) is the only organization that can provide an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow on September 1, 2007 as required by OBSSR.  The SRCD has identified Dr. Dara Blachman as a candidate who is willing and qualified to perform the tasks identified above.  Further, Dr. Blachman has previously served under the OBSSR and therefore has the required knowledge base.

Contractor Qualifications

The SRCD was founded in 1933 to advance research in child development, to foster an interdisciplinary consideration of substantive and methodological problems in the field of child development, and to encourage applications of research findings.  The Society publishes two journals, a newsletter, a membership directory, and a social policy report; holds biennial meetings in March or April of odd-numbered years; sponsors conferences; and supports a Washington, DC-based policy and communications office.  Its membership of more than 5,600 is representative of the various disciplines and professions that contribute to knowledge of child development.  

Under the guidance of the Committee on Policy and Communications, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of policy affecting children and families.  One way this is done is through the Society for Research in Child Development Policy Fellowships.  Since 1978, SRCD has recruited and facilitated the placement of more than 60 AAAS congressional and (since 1991), executive branch fellows.  The goals of these fellowships are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge in developing public policy, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and the federal policy-making mechanisms.

Evaluation Criteria

The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to allow NIH to evaluate the following criteria for award.  Criterion A:  (50 points) - Vendor must have at least 15 years experience in the area of child development and executive branch policy, as well as an in-depth understanding of the role played by social and behavioral sciences research within the NIH mission.  Vendor must be experienced in placing research and policy fellows within the executive branch (specifically NIH).   Criterion B:  (50 points) - Vendor must have an executive branch fellow with a Ph.D. in psychology from a highly rated academic program.  The fellow must also have extensive experience in psychology, child development policy, and the behavioral and social sciences.  

This requirement is for a twelve (12) month period.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received by the closing date of this notice will be considered by NIH.  The quoter shall include all information, which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  

All interested parties shall submit electronic responses to Sally Boakye at boakyes@mail.nih.gov.  Responses must be received no later than 4:00 PM EDT on July 31, 2007.   Please reference solicitation number 07-151/SB on all correspondence to this notice.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE:  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intent to sole source award in support of Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) integration. NOAA intends to award a sole source a contract to Peter Colohan. The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus two (2) one-year option periods.  The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 611430, size standard is $6,000,000.  

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has directed that US component of GEO (USGEO) develop a new national EO policy and a national strategic plan that will provide a framework for US government investment decisions in major Earth observing systems.  This work must be accomplished over the next 15 months and will entail extensive coordination with the intergovernmental GEO community to ensure that the US is well positioned to advance our national economic and societal objectives through our national and international investments. Peter Colohan has the proven ability to plan, integrate, organize, synchronize and utilize their complex knowledge and experience and hence expertise in the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observation and the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).  As the former senior program officer and head of planning for the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland,  Peter Colohan has unique knowledge and experience and hence expertise in the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observation and the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).  He personally assisted in preparations for two high-level Earth observation summits at which representatives of nations, including the Prime Minister of Japan declared the commitment of their countries to pursue the development of a GEOSS through the work of the GEO.  As a senior member of the original secretariat sponsored by the United States, Mr. Colohan stood up the permanent GEO Secretariat offices in Geneva, Switzerland, where he then was hired as a member of the staff of that office and served for another year.   Given this extensive experience, Mr. Colohan is the only person who can perform this function.	

Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a notice of intent to sole source only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NOAA.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), Executive Office Division (EOD) has a requirement to execute an Employee Climate Survey.  OMHA faces a variety of challenges including, but not limited to:  a)  New supervisors who are not familiar with teambuilding skills and typically have minimal supervisory experience; b) Employees who have come from the private sector, other federal agencies, and other public agencies with different cultural and organizational climates; c) Responding to the unique challenges of working in an organization that is led by judges and has a significant attorney presence and understanding the impact of those organizational perspectives on bargaining unit employees; d) Clarifying what administrative and management practices can be improved as the organization establishes standard policies and procedures; e) Attorneys who expect a level of customer service and support from administrative support staff that may or may not be possible with the current staffing plan; and f) As OMHA has primarily focused on workflow processes, relatively little time has been spent on organizational improvement strategies or strategic planning related to human capital, recruitment and retention strategies, and staff productivity analyses.  An Employee Climate Survey is critical to understanding what organizational improvements need to be made to ensure the satisfaction and productivity of its staff.  Tasks include the development of a survey, administration of a survey, collection and storage of the results, analysis and reporting of the results, and providing a summary of the findings and recommendations to OMHA Senior Leadership.  The objective of the Employee Climate Survey is to identify areas in which OMHA can make organizational improvements.  This requirement shall be completed within 12 months.

No solicitation document is available at this time.  Any firm that believes it may have the capabilities to perform this requirement is encouraged to submit their capability statement addressing each of the items/areas cited above.  Interested parties must possess intimate knowledge of OMHA's history, organizational structure, mission, and unique organizational challenges.  Interested parties possessing these required capabilities should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor's name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor's Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.

However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small business concerns (including small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, etc.) are encouraged to review this notice.  E-mail capability statement to lwolf@psc.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This project is for the procurement of continuous beam x-ray systems.  These x-ray systems will be used to detect projectiles in flight in the AEDC aero-ballistic ranges near the launcher muzzles.  The x-ray systems will include x-ray sources, x-ray detectors, power supplies, interface cables, and associated local and remote controls.  X-ray sources and x-ray detectors will be installed by AEDC on opposite sides of aero-ballistic range tanks so that the continuous x-ray beam crosses the trajectory of the projectile.  Interruption of the beam by the projectile will cause the detector to produce an output signal.  The x-ray systems must be capable of discriminating between a launched projectile and sources of interference including muzzle flash and launcher gases.  Deliverables include:  five complete and ready to install x-ray detector modules, five remote detector threshold adjustment panels and interface cables, three complete and ready to install x-ray source modules including power supplies and operator controls, five CD's containing as-built drawings and schematics, five CD's containing operation, installation, and maintenance manuals including the parts list, and test results reports.  Estimated period of performance shall be 150 calendar days after notice of award.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination to Arnold Air Force Base Tennessee 37389.

<DESC>Solicitation for Construction Manager (CM) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO27140.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about May 15, 2007.  Time for completion:  365 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The geographic area is the City of St. Louis, the State of Missouri east of Columbia and the State of Iowa east of and including the metropolitan area of Des Moines.  Project involves:  for building construction projects having a construction cost less than $35,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, develop management plan, schedule, budget, studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings); and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,800,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded in the initial period (1-year) will be $5,000 per firm/joint venture and a minimum of $5,000 per firm/joint venture for each of the exercised option periods.  The maximum amount payable shall not exceed $2,800,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractor?s performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year periods.  The successful CM contractor(s), including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A/E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the ?best value concept? in selecting a CM.  The ?best value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a May 15, 2007.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about June 14, 2007.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220.

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions.

Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the vendor community of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) proposed contract action.  DISA intends to award sole-source to CoreStreet, Ltd., for copyrighted java libraries for Global Directory Service (GDS) and Joint Enterprise Directory Service (JEDS).  The following is the approved justification and approval for use of other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)1

This combined synopsis will close on Monday, July 23, 2007 at 11:00am EST.

Nature/Description of Actions:  The Global Directory Service (GDS) and Joint Enterprise Directory Service (JEDS) requires the use of these copyrighted java libraries to greatly enhance their code?s memory usage and performance handling of PKI certificate validation requests against DOD?s very large PKI Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL).  Usage of these libraries will also enhance the enterprise support that GIDS provides the Department of Defense (DOD) to distribute CRL?s across the GIG architecture in support of the CRL validation request processing from the mandated CAC Card Logon effort.  For JEDS this vendor?s Java libraries will greatly increase the efficiency of how JEDS will process CRL?s as part of its PKI authentication and authorization processes.  Use of these copyrighted Java libraries will result in significant improvement in memory processing such that it will reduce the amount of additional hardware and associated GDS and JEDS required to support the continued growth of CRL validation requests and processing within their architectures.  These libraries have been vetted and tested as part of the existing DOD PKI architecture On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) implementation.  GDS and JEDS programs are key Directory components supporting DoD PKI architecture and NCES core SOA services.

GDS and JEDS will use these two Java CoreStreet Java Libraries
-com.corestreet.rtc.cert.fastX509CRL
-com.corestreet.rtc.cert.FastX509CRLEntry

The CoreStreet software development kit has been certified for interoperability with the Department of Defense (DoD) PKI by the Joint Interoperability and Test Command (JITC).  Delaying the procurement of this critical software places both the JEDS and GDS Programs at risk at not being able to scale to meet expanding customer directory services and PKI CRL validation demands.  It will also hamper testing and deployment of JEDS access control mechanisms, thus hindering implementing secure information exchange to support operations and security of DoD networks.

Description of Work:
The following services and supplies will be provided under this requirement:
Hardware/Software required:
-Corestreet PKI toolkit (for Java platform) JAVASDK Toolkit
-24x7 Support for CoreStreet PKI Toolkit (for Java Platform)-SKU:JAVASDK

The CoreStreet PKI JAVASDK Toolkit is a software library that was created to efficiently process PKI certificate validation processes.  It has a number of features that make it completely unique Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Java SDK, especially for DoD usage; including:
-The only COTS solution interoperable with DoD PKI (as certified by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).
-The only COTS product that includes a Policy Decision Point (PDP) and Policy Administration Point (PAP).

N00244M313     EVALUATION OF OFFERS USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO) (a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.        (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM     (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE     (ii)  PRICE Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (iii), PRICE. Although cost is not as important as past performance, it should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of proposals in relation to past performance, or when it is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the past performance superiority to the Government.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.   (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE REPORT/RATING (Three business references (to be completed by the business reference only) within the last two (2) years to be submitted with offer)  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: ________________________________________ CONTRACT NUMBER: ______________________________________________ SERVICE:                                                         1.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the development of CDF tools for analysis of multi-flow flows.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the University of Michigan for the following reasons:  1.	The University of Michigan is the developer of the STREAM research code which MSFC is presently using on-site for the Main Propulsion System (MPS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).  The University of Michigan is also currently working with MSFC on the development of CFD analysis of MPS components. 2.	It is essential that the modules developed in the proposed work be compatible when being integrated into the STREAM code.  This work is needed for analysis of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). 3.	NASA earmarked money for the CUIP (Constellation University Institutes Program) under which the STREAM code was developed as research code. As research code, it is not commercialized for others to use. Therefore it is to the Governments best interest to keep any work associated with the STREAM code with the same contractor.     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 07/23/2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This is a combined pre-solicitation and solicitation notice. The purpose of this solicitation is to define the range of programmatic activities that will comprise an approximately two-year, $310,000/year, program to provide technical support to the National Assembly of Tanzania (Parliament). This support will enable the legislative branch of Tanzania government to provide focused oversight on the actions of the executive branch, and will promote a transparent and accountable system of key public institutions.   This solicitation outlines a range of support that has been appraised and designed in conjunction with the Office of the Speaker and the Parliamentary Services Commission, which has requested USAID assistance to implement it.  This builds upon previous USAID (and DFID) support to the National Assembly, and is a continuation of ongoing US Government support to the legislative process in Tanzania.

<DESC>This is notice of intent to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to High Desert Special Operations Center (HDSOC), 410 E Street, Hawthorne, NV  89415-1237 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot, Hawthorne, NV during the period 3 Aug ? 2 Sep 2007.  The information received to support this sole source reveals that the environment in the Hawthorne, NV area closely resembles that of Afghanistan, consequently providing the most realistic training environment for these soldiers.  Further, HQ, Army Sustainment Command issued a no-cost agreement to HDSOC for sole use of the ranges on Hawthorne Army Depot.  This agreement limits the use of the ranges to provide training to soldiers to HDSOC only.  This notice is not a request for offers.  The anticipated date of award is 25 July 2007.  Because of the inability of any other contractor to obtain authority to training on these ranges, and because it is necessary for the soldiers to train during this period and in this environment, the contractor identified is the only known source for the subject requirement.  Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bona fide competition exists to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot.  This training shall include extensive training in the care, use, riding, and employment of horses, pack animals, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (specifically the 450 ATV), and general purpose mobility vehicles (GMV).  It shall also include day and night and off-road driving in GMVs.  The training shall also include shooting at moving targets and shoot-on-the-move instruction, door breacher training, IED simulation and scenarios and shall require the contractor provide urban combat range facilities.  Vendor responses shall be in writing and include documents that clearly demonstrate the ability to train on the Hawthorne Army Depot and have full use of the installation ranges and other facilities to support this training.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered; however, determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government.  No extensions will be granted.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  The point of contact for this requirement is Ms. Sandra Aman, Contracting Officer, e-mail:  amans@soc.mil.

<DESC>COMNAVAIRSYSCOM is seeking information from potential suppliers regarding electret microphones for MBU-20 Series Aviator's Oxygen Masks.  The microphones will be used in the MBU-23/P Aviators Oxygen Mask to mitigate "hard-to-fit" subjects that fall outside the 3 to 97 percentile intended fit range for the male aircrew population and smaller stature females.  The microphone will be a noise cancelling, DC-powered, high gain microphone designed for use in pressure type oxygen mask.  It will be a component part of the airborne communication system, which will provide communication of high intelligibility under extreme noise conditions encountered in military aircraft.  THIS ANNOUNCMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This sources sought synopsis is seeking information from sources that are capable of manufacturing electret microphones.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis should be in the form of a technical approach that outlines processes needed to ensure that all aspects of a microphones systems engineering methodology are used in the execution of the program.  As a minimum, (1) the new microphone will be compatible with existing MBU-20 series Aircrew Oxygen Masks; (2) compatible with current inventory tactical aircraft electrical systems and; (3) smaller than current microphone elements. It is requested that all interested parties submit a capability statement/documentation (under 25 pages) specifically addressing the technical approach to be taken to satisfy their statement of work tasking, potential teaming arrangements, related past performance, general corporate information, and their business size.  TELEPHONE REPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING (i.e. fax, email, or letterhead).  All responses will be kept confidential and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any proposal preparation costs associated with responding to this synopsis.  Proprietary Data in the responses will be protected where so designed.  All responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 9 Aug 2007.  All responses must be submitted to the Naval Air Systems Command, Attn:  Denise Farmer, Code:  AIR-2.4.3.3.3., Bldg. # 2272, Suite 353.15, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Email address:  Denise.Farmer@navy.mil; Telephone Number (301) 757-3667; FAX (301) 757-6597.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Sensor Sciences in Pleasant Hill, California for the purchase of an Neutron Detector with MCP Stack under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Sole source determination is based on the need for a Neutron Detector with MCP Stack, which can be obtained only from Sensor Sciences.  NIST requires a one-to-one emergency backup of its current MCP based, high resolution neutron imaging detector.  Sensor Sciences is the provider of the original detector currently in use at NIST, which is a proprietary design of Sensor Sciences.  Sensor Sciences does not license this technology to any other companies.  

NIST requires one (1) high resolution neutron imaging MCP detector system, with new detector housing, new MCP stack with brazen body and aperture stop.  In addition, the required system shall meet the following minimum specifications:

1.	Detector technology shall have neutron imaging special resolution of at least 0.020 mm.  This resolution shall have been publicly demonstrated by measuring the edge spread of a neutron absorber such as Cadmium or Gadolinium using a thermal neutron beam.  Spatial resolution is defined as the variance determined from an error function fit to the measured edge spread.  Public demonstration includes either publication in a peer reviewed journal, or image data and experimental details that can be shared with and evaluated by NIST.
2.	The detector shall have a global count rate that is at least 3 MHz.
3.	The detectors field of view shall be at least 25 mm in diameter, with the capability of scaling up to a field of view of 32 mm  x 32 mm.
4.	The detector pixel pitch will be less than 0.010 mm.
5.	The neutron sensitive portion of the detector will be able to be separated from the readout electronic (such as ancillary signal processing equipment such as NIM modules and/or a computer) with cables up to 10 meters in length.
6.	The detector shall be exposed for up to 1000 hours with only a gradual reduction in performance that can be software corrected.  After 1000 hours, the detector shall be able to be refurbished to a new condition by the supplier.
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on July 30, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Request for Information
Postal Lab - Printing, Duplicating Services and Office Supplies

Responses to Request for Information (RFI) on Postal Lab ? Printing, Duplicating Services and Office Supplies

July 13, 2007

Question #1

If the Postal Service?s test is successful in Schaumburg, IL, how many more sites would the USPS look to expand to in the long term, and in what types of markets? 

USPS Response:

The concept being tested is new and at this point in time we are not prepared to discuss expansion nor do we know what markets.

Question #2

Could a provider offer their transportation related services in the space allotted to the Copy & Print center location?

USPS Response:

No, those types of services would be seen in direct conflict with similar services offered by the USPS with in our location.

Question #3

If a provider felt that more than 330 square feet of space would be necessary, is the USPS open to a larger footprint?

USPS Response

No, current design restraints with the Schaumburg location have place a limit to the 300 square feet.  However, thoughts and perspectives on what would work best work can be helpful as the USPS looks forward after the test.

Question #4

If the USPS is successful in their test and during the future planning of locations would the USPS allow a provider to assist in the selection of locations?

USPS Response

It is too early in the test development phase for the USPS to seek assistance for expansion. Though, if a provider has company expertise in selecting retail sites this could be made known to the USPS through their informational response.
Question #5

Do you have a site layout or floor plan of the Schaumburg location?  If so, can this be shared?

USPS Response

The site floor plan will be provided once the USPS has narrowed its focus to those who have taken the time to respond.

Question #6

Would a provider be able to use their brand colors and signage at the Schaumburg location?

USPS Response

This is a possible option under consideration but would need to take into account USPS and ?The Village of Schaumburg? considerations.

Question #7

Is the USPS open to self service only copy and print options without appropriate vendor/provider staffing?

USPS Response

Yes.

Request for Information
Postal Lab - Printing, Duplicating Services and Office Supplies

Responses to Request for Information (RFI) on Postal Lab ? Printing, Duplicating Services and Office Supplies

July 13, 2007

Question #1

If the Postal Service?s test is successful in Schaumburg, IL, how many more sites would the USPS look to expand to in the long term, and in what types of markets? 

USPS Response:

The concept being tested is new and at this point in time we are not prepared to discuss expansion nor do we know what markets.

Question #2

Could a provider offer their transportation related services in the space allotted to the Copy & Print center location?

USPS Response:

No, those types of services would be seen in direct conflict with similar services offered by the USPS with in our location.

Question #3

If a provider felt that more than 330 square feet of space would be necessary, is the USPS open to a larger footprint?

USPS Response

No, current design restraints with the Schaumburg location have place a limit to the 300 square feet.  However, thoughts and perspectives on what would work best work can be helpful as the USPS looks forward after the test.

Question #4

If the USPS is successful in their test and during the future planning of locations would the USPS allow a provider to assist in the selection of locations?

USPS Response

It is too early in the test development phase for the USPS to seek assistance for expansion. Though, if a provider has company expertise in selecting retail sites this could be made known to the USPS through their informational response.
Question #5

Do you have a site layout or floor plan of the Schaumburg location?  If so, can this be shared?

USPS Response

The site floor plan will be provided once the USPS has narrowed its focus to those who have taken the time to respond.

Question #6

Would a provider be able to use their brand colors and signage at the Schaumburg location?

USPS Response

This is a possible option under consideration but would need to take into account USPS and ?The Village of Schaumburg? considerations.

Question #7

Is the USPS open to self service only copy and print options without appropriate vendor/provider staffing?

USPS Response

Yes.

<DESC>UPDATE (16 July 2007) Response date has been extended to 31 July 2007.  Amendment 0003 has been posted. UPDATE (13 July 2007) Amendment 0002 has been posted. DESCRIPTION:  Solicitation Number FA8601-07-R-0046:The scope consists of  furnishing all labor, equipment, appliances, devices and materials, and  performing all operations necessary in connection with Project 050011,  Replace SCADA System Basewide. This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days. This is an  unrestricted acquisition in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must  be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award  of solicitations issued after 31 May 1998.

It requires the correct installation of thousands of  control conductors, hundreds of relays, and hundreds of sensors. Mistakes  can cause unscheduled power outages to multiple facilities throughout the  base, and can be difficult to trace to eliminate. Each unscheduled power  outage has a large financial impact to the base, and the primary  electrical distribution system is the most critical utility system of all.  Notes: (1)The solicitation will be available on the website on or about 22  June 2007, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.

<ARCHDATE>11302007
<CONTACT>Charlotte Puthoff, 937-257-6636 x4094
<DESC>Department of the Air Force, AFSAC  Air Force Security Assistance Center,  1822 Van Patton Drive, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433-5337 The Air Force  Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) is issuing the attached Request for  Proposal (RFP) to provide Emergency Airfield Lighting (EALS) for nine (9)  air bases, twenty-one (21) EALS Transport Vehicles, Program Management,  and any associated training for the Taiwan Air Force (TAF). A Statement of Objective (SOO) is attachment 1 to the RFP.  The contractor  is required to prepare the Statement of Work, based on the SOO, for this  effort. The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and the period of  performance will be for two (2) years starting approximately 28 Sep 2007.  Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Charlotte  A. Puthoff, Contract Negotiator, AFSAC/PKT, Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio via  email: charlotte.puthoff@wpafb.af.mil. Charlotte A. Puthoff, Contract  Negotiator, Phone 937-257-7298, ext. 4094. Email:  charlotte.puthoff@wpafb.af.mil Questions & Answers Submitted: Q:  -- SOO, paragraph 4, states training shall occur at each of the 9  bases, but Field Service is only allowing for 3.5 weeks for training and  PMRs.  The last contract which provided complete training for Taiwan EALS  was scheduled as 1 week per base (1 day preparation, 2.5 days classroom, 1  day field, .5 day student testing).  The Field Service timing identified  would only allow for training at 3 bases, not all 9, for the same level of  training provided previously.  Is this correct then, that training will  only occur at 3 bases?  Please clarify. A:  The plan is to do 3 bases as stated below.  This will be 1 week at  each base including training ( 1day preparation, 2.5 days classroom, 1 day  field  1/2 day student testing).  At the end of the 3 weeks training, a  Program management meeting will be held.  This will be approximately 2  days.    Return to the US until the next 3 sets of equipment are ready for  the next 3 bases which as stated in the RFP is approximately 6 weeks  later.  Go back to Taiwan and do the next 3 bases when the equipment is in  Taiwan.  Return to the US for approximately 6 weeks later until the next 3  sets of equipment are in Taiwan.   This is a 3 part plan.  There will be 3  trips to Taiwan consisting of 3/12 weeks each trip.  Q:    -- Evaluation Factors, Sub Factor 2:  the export license process  requires a valid contract, therefore, it is not possible to provide  documentation verifying that the export license already exists prior to  contract award.   Based on past experience, an export license was obtained  for the required items, after contract award.  Is it acceptable to provide  the past export license for these items as a reference?  Please clarify A: The contractor must demonstrate that they can obtain an export license  in a timely manner to meet the delivery requirements of the contract. This Solicitation is hereby cancelled.

<CONTACT>GREG LENGSFELD PURCHASING AGENT 3032369337     glengsfeld@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Columbia Environmental Research Center, has a requirement for a high frequency, high resolution imaging sonar with tilt rotator, for the study of inter-jurisdictional fishes including paddlefish, shovelnose sturgeon and the critically endangered pallid sturgeon.  Extensive capture and telemetry studies are underway with the primary objective to document and verify spawning behavior.  Technology currently employed only allows for gross determination of movement and aggregation by fishes, without the ability to actually determine when and where the event occurred.  The USGS requires the technology to visually verify that the targeted behavior has occurred in the deep and turbid water of large rivers.  Direct visual or video observation using standard technology is not possible due to high turbidity, high suspended solids, and high bed load conditions where these fish live.  The only technology that currently exists to identify and visualize fish behavior in real-time under these conditions is high-frequency, high definition imaging sonar. The U.S. Geological Survey, considers this specified requirement as a sole source to Sound Metrics Corporation, 15029 Bothell Way NE, Ste. 100, Seattle, WA 98155, because the DIDSON-Dual Frequency Identification Sonar is the only commercially available sonar system that meets the listed specifications and is capable of accomplishing the study specifications.  The DIDSON is a dual frequency identification sonar or acoustic camera which provides almost video quality images in zero visibility and turbid environments.  The equipment and technology are proprietary and are protected by several U.S. Patents.  DIDSON is the only commercially available high definition imaging sonar on the market today. Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these products at the same cost may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer USGS, PO BOX 25046, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225-0046 no later than the closing date of this requirement (07/26/2007) 4:PM MST.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with a noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a request for a quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate a written solicitation.  This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-04, effective 08 June 2005.  No number notes apply.  Any questions may be directed to Gregory Lengsfeld, Contract Specialist, at 303-236-9337 or email glengsfeld@usgs.gov.

<CONTACT>John Hedeen Contract Specialist 2083785105     jhedeen@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) Pacific Northwest Regional Office intends to a negotiate a sole-source advisory and assistance services contract with ETM Consulting (soon to be Synergy Northwest, LLC) of Beaverton, Oregon to support and improve the operations of the Federal Caucus.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  Reclamation is one of eight Federal agencies, collectively known as the Federal Caucus, that has natural resource responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to coordinate a comprehensive, long-term strategy to restore threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead throughout the Columbia-Snake River Basin of the Pacific Northwest.  A key responsibility of the Federal Caucus agencies is coordination of activities related to Biological Opinions for the Columbia River hydro system. NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have the lead in developing Biological Opinions to protect ESA-listed fish from jeopardy and formal recovery plans to guide their recovery. The three agencies with responsibilities for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) are the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Bonneville Power Administration. They are collectively referred to as the "action agencies" (also known as the "FCRPS action agencies"). They carry out the actions under the Biological Opinions that are designed to protect ESA-listed fish affected by existence of the dams. There are 13 ESA-listed populations of Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead that migrate through the Columbia and Snake Rivers to the ocean and back. In addition to these fish, also referred to as anadromous, one Columbia Basin resident (non-migratory) fish, the bull trout, is also listed under ESA. The Federal Caucus agencies are committed to the recovery of these fish to sustainable levels. Reclamation has determined that ETM Consulting is the only reasonable source to advise and assist the Federal Caucus with its salmon recovery program based upon the following criteria: Knowledge of FCRPS operations in the Columbia-Snake River Basin, and its impact upon endangered and threatened fish; options for fish survival improvement throughout the range of species in the Columbia River basin; experience and past performance associated with the strategic planning efforts for endangered and threatened fish in the Columbia-Snake River Basin; experience and past performance in a high-level administrative position, and capability to interact successfully with the executives of Federal agencies; location in the general geographical area of Portland, Oregon; and price.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Marie S. Spurgeon Contracting Officer 9169897218     mspurgeon@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: The Bureau of Reclamation, Central California Area Office has a requirement for a firm-fixed price contract, for the installation of Recreation Area signage at New Melones Lake/Resources, Sonora, CA.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 238990, small business size standard of $13.0 M.   The scope of work will involve digging post holes, attaching signs to posts, and installing signs in accordance with Reclamation Sign Standards.  Reclamation will provide the signs, posts and mounting hardware. Technical Requirements are:  The installation of signs within the New Melones Lake Project Area will be in accordance with the Bureau of Reclamation Sign Guidelines.  No deviation from the Sign Guidelines will be made when installing the signs without the approval of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  All sign locations will be determined and marked by the COR prior to installation. Sign Posts - all sign posts will be 4"x 6" or 4"x 4" pressure treated Douglas fir as indicated on the sign table Sign Post Depth - All posts will be buried 36" below ground level Sign Post Backfill - Backfill will be compacted gravel or shale.  The material removed from the dug post hole can be used for backfill if it consists of more than 50% rock.  If the dirt removed is more than 50% sand, silt or clay, compacted gravel will be used to backfill the post hole.    Sign Post Orientation - The sign will be attached to the 4" side of the post. Sign Height - The height above ground line for the bottom of each sign will be as indicated on the sign table.  Any needed alterations to the height above ground line must be approved by the COR prior to installation.  After a sign post is cut, the exposed cut will be coated with a suitable preservative and the cut side of the post will go below ground. Sign Lateral Clearance - Edge of the sign is a minimum of 6' from the edge of the road unless the topography does not allow it. Sign Canting - The sign is to be mounted at 93 degrees to the direction of, and facing, those they are intended to serve.  This helps to reduce sun glare.  When the sign is located on a slope, the sign will be angled for maximum visibility. The top edge of the sign is to be level. Post to Sign Attachment - The sign post will be attached to the sign so that the top of the post is one inch below the top of the sign and the outside edge of the post is just inside of the end of the radius.  If the sign requires two posts, the edge of the post will be 4 inches from the edge of the sign.  The purpose of offsetting posts is to ensure the edge or top of the posts will not be visible to oncoming traffic. Bolt Holes - Signs that have one post will require 2 drilled bolt holes.  Signs that have two posts will require 4 drilled bolt holes. Bolts -The signs will be attached to the post using a carriage bolt, washer, and nut.  The size of the fasteners will be 3/8", or ", as indicated on the sign table.  Bolt Attachment - The end of the bolt should not extend more than " past the nut.  The exposed reads at the end of the bolt will be crimped or upset in a way that will not allow the nut to be removed.  Work should be completed no later than October 31, 2007. Interested parties should include should include the following in their response: Business name, address, contact, and telephone number. Any contractor to be awarded a government contract must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is requesting information from 8(a) sources that provide hazardous waste removal and disposal services. Interested sources shall submit a capabilities statement to Ms. Nanaesi Amoo at: 
U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Attn: N. Amoo, FAC 2401 Jefferson Davis Highway, Alexandria, VA 22301 or Fax: 202-307-4877, or email nanaesi.amoo@usdoj.gov.  All statements must be received on or before July 30, 2007 at 4:30pm EDT.  No literature will be returned to responding sources and each source is solely responsible for all expenses associated with submitting their literature.

GENERAL:  This section covers the requirements for the management of ?hazardous waste,? as defined herein, seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), or seized by state or local law enforcement agencies and authorized by DEA for removal from domestic clandestine drug laboratories, DEA?s Forensic Laboratories, DEA?s Office of Training, and other waste-generating activities authorized by DEA.   

CONTRACT AREA:
Nevada (08-03) (09-03) 
Colorado (13-03)

OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this contract is to secure the services of a hazardous waste removal/disposal Contractor who is qualified to perform the "duties of a generator" of hazardous waste on behalf of law enforcement agencies, and to properly manage the hazardous waste seized by law enforcement at clandestine drug laboratories, generated by forensic laboratories, mobile laboratories, training exercises, or by other waste-generating activities authorized by DEA. 
Waste management, including disposal and a certificate of said disposal, shall be in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations. All on-site work shall be conducted with the appropriate level of personal protection equipment including OSHA Levels A through D and Confined Space Entry, as defined by 29 CFR.  DEA, and therefore the Contractor, is not responsible for the remedial cleanup and disposal of residual waste (e.g., contaminated soil, septic tanks, appliances, structure interiors, etc.), which may remain after the removal of gross contamination.  There is no funding authorization under this contract for cleanup and disposal of residual waste 

Remedial cleanup does not include the removal of contaminated property except that the Contractor may be directed by the DEA Representative to remove contaminated property that constitutes a law enforcement concern (e.g., inextricably contaminated with a controlled substance), including any equipment or containers subject to forfeiture that the DEA Representative directs the Contractor to remove because it cannot be separated safely from any dangerous, toxic, or hazardous raw materials or products. Otherwise, this contract does not authorize payment for disposal of such items removed from the authorized removal site.  The Contractor shall advise the law enforcement officer in charge at the authorized removal site if the Contractor believes any item identified for removal is not allowed under this contract.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to Airline/Passenger Wireless Communications Services for Enhanced FAMS Applications. Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than August 17, 2007 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA is supporting the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) in this investigation and does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow the industry an opportunity to provide technical and business information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about wireless telecommunications services that are or soon will be available to U.S. airlines and/or passengers of U.S. domestic and international aircraft to assess the potential use of these services in enhancing both on-board and off-board (air-ground) communications services for FAMS applications.  The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA and the FAMS to assess the technology readiness level of potential solutions and plan for potential establishment of a future public-private partnership that enhances on-board and off-board communications for Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) in all phases of flight. In general, FAMs on duty need to be able to communicate with other FAMs and, potentially, crew members and other law enforcement officers onboard the aircraft, as well as with FAMs in ground-based mission operations control centers.  Communications primarily take the form of messaging and digital data file exchanges both onboard the aircraft and between the aircraft and the ground.  However, voice capability is required for some modes of FAMs operations.  Details on specific minimum, desired and maximum requirements for data rates, availability during each phase of flight, and acceptable latency will be provided only to those companies deemed qualified for follow-on private discussions by the FAMS and/or NASA. That determination will be based on the content and quality of the response to this RFI or on established credentials from existing relationships with the FAMS and/or NASA on this or similar activities.    One of the primary goals of a potential future public-private partnership is to leverage to the greatest extent practicable the existing service capabilities and infrastructure made available to all air travel passengers in the form of airline passenger communications services (APC).	This goal is believed to provide the most benefits to all parties for the least additional total life-cycle costs and operational risks for each party. However, the FAMS is open to consideration of public-private partnerships with providers of airline administrative communications (AAC) services and airline operational control (AOC) services.   Qualified providers are considered to be those U.S. commercial entities including established and recognized: air transportation carriers, APC, AOC or AAC service providers, wireless telecommunications network service providers or equipment manufacturers, aircraft or avionics equipment manufacturers, aeronautical communications systems integrators, or business consultants to the aviation industry.	 Qualified providers are requested to provide information that describes the capabilities of their currently available systems and components as well as near-term enhancements or longer-term development efforts that may be of potential benefit to FAMS in any and all flight domains. The primary goal of this investigation is to identify those communications services that are already available and those that may soon be available to all passengers.  However, the FAMS is also interested in influencing or leveraging through public-private partnerships the design of future onboard and air-ground communications services to provide even greater capabilities.   Interested companies are invited to submit specific information on any or all of the following topics: 1. Category of responder:     Indicate your status as an: air carrier; on-board service       provider; off-board service; provider; terrestrial service       provider; component supplier; systems integrator; or       advisor/consultant; and     Provide data on the actual or potential size of fleet, type       of aircraft, or percentage of relevant market penetration. 2. Equipage:      Provide relevant equipage data and/or plans as desired. 3. Primary communications system(s) proposed for general airline and/or passenger use:     Describe primary solution for on-board wireless data local       area network,        Including operational spectrum, bandwidth and latency,        Including expected interfaces to commercial-off-the-shelf  	(COTS) personal electronic devices (PEDs);         Including on-board cabin/crew communications, and        Including sensor data distribution within the airframe;     Describe primary solution for off-board air/ground data       communications,        Via APC, AAC, or AOC services,        Including operational spectrum, bandwidth and latency;     Describe primary solution for terrestrial interconnectivity;      Describe primary solution for on-board and off-board voice       communications;      Describe alternate or secondary solutions for data and voice       communications; and 4. Proposed concepts of use of airline and/or passenger communications systems for FAMs specific support:     Describe how FAMs access and use commercial on-board       systems;      Describe how FAMs access and use off-board systems (via       terrestrial RF or satellite);     Describe approach to compatibility with COTS PEDs and       applications, or the need for any custom PEDs and/or       applications;     Describe connectivity with mission operations control       facilities via terrestrial infrastructure;     Describe concepts for FAMs use in specific phases of flight;       and      Provide estimates of capacity available to FAMs during       nominal and peak operations. 5.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Greater Southwest Acquisition Center is responsible for the products and services under Schedule 84, Total Solutions for Law Enforcement, Security, Facility Management Systems, Fire, Rescue, Special Purpose Clothing, Marine Craft and Emergency/Disaster Response.  As part of this responsibility, we are reviewing current trends in the industry and in Agency requirements.  The trends we are interested in are regarding changes in security approaches and the integration of security requirements with other requirements.  Additionally, we are interested in whether the term Security Convergence is used to describe the integration of physical security, informational security, and other operational requirements into single contract actions.    

Specifically, the Greater Southwest Acquisition Center is requesting information from Industry, Academia, and Government Agencies regarding experience with contracts, task orders, Blanket Purchase Agreements, and contract requirements involving security and security convergence.   

SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED:    
The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center is requesting the following specific information from current or previous contracts and/or Task Orders:    

A.  Definitions of Security Convergence or other terms used to describe requirements that cross functional or life cycle boundaries.  .For example, is Security Convergence used to describe contract requirements that involve both Physical and Informational Security?  What are the different requirements being incorporated in contracts along with traditional security requirements (such as facility/energy management and building maintenance)?  Are Contingency of Operations (COOP) support efforts being integrated into security requirements?  Are Life Cycle requirements being included in contract requirements and if so, how?    

B.  How requirements are being met by the industry.  Are formal or informal contractor teams being used?  Are Prime / Sub-Contractor arrangements being used?  How are all the various requirements across all the functional areas being addressed (such as physical access, surveillance, data, information security) if a specific vendor does not possess all the expertise required?    

C.  Pricing structures being used in security/security convergence contracts.  Are Fixed Price (FFP/FPIF), Time and Materials (T&M), Cost type (CPFF/CPIF/CPAF), or some hybrid pricing structures used?    

D.  Information on the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract Task Orders in fulfilling security requirements.  Are Federal Supply Schedule contracts being used to meet security and/or security convergence requirements?  If so, what Schedules and SINS are being used?  If not, what are the roadblocks to using Schedules? If Schedules were used, what were the problems or issues (if any)?  Is GSA E-Buy being used to facilitate the use of Schedule contracts, and if so, is it effective?    

E.  Any information on facilitating or simplifying the contracting process for using Schedule contracts.  Are there changes to systems such as GSA Advantage or E-Buy that would facilitate the use of those systems to contract for these requirements?  Are there additional training or training materials (such as templates) that would assist in facilitating the contracting process?    

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED:  
The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center is also requesting the following information and examples:    

A.  Examples of Contractor Teaming Arrangements or other formal documentation that outlines responsibilities among multiple-contractor teams.    

B.  Examples of Performance Based Work Statements or Statements of Work for integrated security contracts or task orders.    

C.  Identification of Federal Agencies utilizing integrated security / security convergence contracting.    

D.  Information regarding commercial security and security convergence trends.    

Additionally, you are invited to provide any additional information regarding Security or Security Convergence not addressed above.  Also, any suggestions that would improve the use and value of Schedule 84 to meet security and security convergence requirements will be greatly appreciated and is actively solicited.    


This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not plan to award a contract based on any responses or otherwise pay for the information solicited.        

Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.   Responses to this RFI will not be returned.    

Replies to this RFI should be sent via e-mail to larry.mathias@gsa.gov with a subject line of Security Convergence RFI Response.

<DESC>The Tactile display system works for clandestine tactile communication, and allows for experimentation in the laboratory and in the field.  System uses an 8-tactor belt, 8-channel portable, and enclosed evaluation board with rechargeable battery and AC power supply.  The system utilizes a Samsung Q1 tablet computer, which uses sample programs to allow for the control of tactors, and downloading and controlling sequences through text-based input.  A tactor system API for Windows (Win32) simplifies prog ramming.  All of the components are housed in a Pelican (or similar) case.  Further, the advanced evaluation board must have three available UARTS (serial ports) for connection to external sensors such as GPS, INS, and Compass.  It must have an on-board Zi gbee radio for communication with a wrist display module or other peripheral devices.  The evaluation board must have an upgraded on-board processor to allow control of tactor and processing data from external sensors, and must also have a serial interface  compatible with Bluetooth dongle.

<SUBJECT>68 -- Dibrom 8 Pesticide
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Government intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order with ADAPCO, Inc. for Dibrom Insecticide.  Macdill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to ADAPCO, Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the existing agency requirements, for the following reasons stated in the J&A: Hillsborough County Mosquito Control uses Dibrom in flyovers on behalf of MacDill AFB.  MacDill AFB replaces the pesticide they use on our property.  MacDill can not expect Hillsborough to recalibrate their equipment and interrupt their routines to utilize a different pesticide.  It is likely that they would decline to perform our flyovers and we would be forced to request help from Scott AFB.  Dibrom is only available from ADAPCO, the sole source distributor for the product.  Utilization of another product would also require Hillsborough County to inventory a second product just for our convenience and require that we purchase larger inventories of that product.  It would not be prudent to over burden Hillsborough County with these requests when they are providing us a service at no charge. This announcement constitutes the only announcement. A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 325320 The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 2879 with a small business size of $23 million. A Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  Market Research was conducted for the purchase of Dibrom Insecticide.  AMVAC Chemical Company is the sole manufacturer and ADAPCO is the only authorized redistributor for the state of Florida.  If no response to this notice is received by 4:00 p.m. EST. on 24 Jul 07, the award for Dibrom will be made to ADAPCO.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Small-Arms-Fire Source Localizer Locate sources of small-arms fire, mortars, RPGs, and similar weapons used in Urban Combat with LifeGuard
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Small-Arms-Fire Source Localizer

Locate sources of small-arms fire, mortars, RPGs, and similar weapons used in Urban Combat with LifeGuard

Does not rely on muzzle flash to locate source of fire, robust to optical clutter, very low false alarm rate
                                      
Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license the LifeGuard small-arms-fire source localizer technology for use by military, law enforcement, and government agencies.

Background: There are several optical technologies that locate sources of small-arms-fire, but these systems rely on muzzle flash, making them ineffective against weapons with flash suppressors, when the shooter is behind a wall or sniping from inside a building.  Moreover, these systems cannot determine the trajectory of the projectile, and are susceptible to optical clutter.

Description:  This technology provides algorithms that accurately localize small-arm-fire by tracking bullets from high-powered weapons, automatic rifles, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), mortars, and similar projectiles.  The software integrates commercially available infrared video cameras, processes raw imagery data, detects and tracks projectiles, and determines the location of the shooters within error bounds. The technique and algorithms have been shown to be resistant to optical clutter.  
To see a simulation picture, go to: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/SmallArmsFireLocalizer.php
Advantages:  
?	Does not rely on muzzle flash ?? Can track bullets from weapons with flash suppressors ?? More useful than traditional small-arms-fire localization
?	Adaptable to environments with high optical clutter ?? Reduces false alarm locations ?? More accurate shooter locator, very low false alarm rate
?	Detects and tracks projectiles in-flight ?? Detects and localizes multiple shooters ?? Rapid data analysis for immediate offensive action
?	Uses off-the-shelf components ?? Lower manufacturing costs

Potential Applications:   Small-arms-fire detection and source localization have many applications in the urban battlespace:
?	Situation awareness and battlespace management in urban combat operations
?	Threat localization for helicopter self-protection
?	Sniper neutralization for law enforcement agencies and protective services

Intellectual Property:  Portfolio of two U.S. patents and one U.S. patent application.

Development Status:.
?	Basic LifeGuard technology developed during the 1990s with IR&D funds.
?	DARPA sponsored 2005 experiments extended range to 400 m and robust performance against optical clutter.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market.  Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Small-Arms-Fire Source Localizer technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>V -- Metrochecks for Transit Subsidy Program
<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval. The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the United States Access Board (ABA), intends to negotiate sole-source procurement with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for metrochecks and fare cards. The Government intends to award for a base period of one year and four option years.

Mission:  The United States Access Board is an independent Federal agency devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities. Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Board is now a leading source of information on accessible design. The Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and for electronic and information technology. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and on accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that cover federally funded facilities.

ABA Background:  1973 The Access Board was created
Several years after the ABA had become law, Congress observed that compliance had been uneven and that no initiatives to create Federal design standards for accessibility were underway. Clearly, one central agency needed to take charge of enforcing the ABA and ensuring development of design standards. The concept of such an agency began to take shape as Congress considered the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 502 of this law created the Access Board, originally named the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. The Board was charged with ensuring Federal agency compliance with the ABA and proposing solutions to the environmental barriers problems addressed in the ABA.

Nature and Description of Action:  The United States Access Board requires metrochecks and fare cards for the public rail transportation service in the DC metro area including Maryland and Virginia communities.
 
A sole source to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is intended for this order. No other known sources have access to the metrochecks and fare cards.

No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than seven days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.

Other Information:  Electronic submissions, in response to this Notice, shall reference SS-07-0015 and be sent to the attention of Susan Barker and e-mailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00 PM ET, Tuesday, July 24, 2007. Please notethat an RFQ document is not available at this time.

<SUBJECT>B -- STUDY OF LATENT MORTALITY OF JUVENILE SALMONIDS
<DESC>THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER 
THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR 
INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT 
PROPOSALS. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE 
PROPOSALS. HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF 
PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS 
IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000. 
The office of Fish Ecology Division located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire services from the University of Washington to study and analyze possible mechanisms associated with potential latent mortality to juvenile salmonids during passage through the Federal Columbia River Power System.  The period of performance is through 31 September 2008.  The University of Washington is the only entity that is capable of performing the work because they have developed the theory and protocols for applying the theory to the subject study and analysis.  Vitality theory (Anderson 1992, 2000) was developed by Dr. Anderson to deal with latent mortality by characterizing the effect of stress on the rate of loss of vitality, a measure of an organism?s remaining survival capacity. Vitality changes stochastically with age, selectively culling the weaker individuals leaving the strong, more vital, organisms to reproduce. They have demonstrated with laboratory (Cobleigh 2003, Springman et al. 2005) and field studies (Anderson et al. In press) that the effect of cumulative stress, or more generally past environmental conditions, can be quantitatively related to future survival. Furthermore, they have demonstrated that the linkage between cumulative stress and future survival can be estimated through challenge experiments where organisms of differing experiences are subjected to a standardized challenge (Salinger et al. 2003). Vitality theory and the challenge experiments conducted means to identify the effects of specific life history experiences on salmon for the first time. The theory has been applied to several groups of animals but not to juvenile salmon and the physiological burdens they experience when migrating downstream through the FCRPS. To do so, the theory and application protocols that have been developed and applied by the University of Washington will have to be modified and adapted for the unique sampling conditions and facilities at Bonneville Dam.  Therefore, implementation for this NOAA Fisheries study under the FCRPS Biological Opinion requires the services and capabilities of the University of Washington.  All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 526-6025 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This is a 100% Small Business set aside.

 The requirement consists of the following items:  

CLIN 0001- Ten (10) each- Pinnacle Dual Tube Goggle with Gain.  Should come with Hand Select Pinnacle Tubes, LIFs and Standard Accessories.  This goggle must:

?	Offer depth perception enhanced with Gain Control. Each eyepiece will have its own gain control knob to allow the user to adjust the tube brightness (gain) lower to compensate for overly bright conditions or to increase the gain under extreme dark conditions. The user can also lower the gain in one eye so that when the binoculars are removed one eye is more dark adapted.
?	Be powered via one AA battery for up to 10 hours of continuous use and be fully submersible up to 66 feet.
CLIN 0002- Six (6) each-Monocular Nigh Vision Goggle gain control, comes with all accessories plus weapon mount and shuttered eye guard.  Its optics are the highest quality. The new redesigned battery housing (uses one each AA battery) simplifies use with greater dependability and lighter weight, and most important of all, this model must be able to:

?	Be head and helmet mounted allowing the user to retain his night adapted vision in one eye while viewing his surroundings through the illuminated eyepiece.

Under extremely dark conditions, gain control allows the user to adjust the gain upward, giving him a better image. Under high light conditions, details can be washed out due to an excess of light.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

<DESC>1.  Background:

The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to taking care of its own.  Our Air Force (AF) members and their families deserve the best support possible.  AF readiness targets combat stress reactions, the deployment environment and deployment-related stressors. Tailored support of the base helping agencies targets deployment challenges and engages the services of base helping agencies.  The AF community is represented by several agencies, one of which is the Office of the Surgeon General (SG), Community Behavioral Health Division (CBHD).  

The USAF SG CBHD provides military readiness support through management of various programs engaged in individual, family and community health initiatives.  These programs include Family Advocacy; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment/Demand Reduction; Education and Development Intervention Services/ Special Needs; and Suicide Prevention.  Their objective is to address intervention and prevention strategies for common modifiable behavioral risk factors.  

The challenge is recognizing the stressful situations of military members; specific behaviors and concerns related to deployment stress.  Congress has provided funding through the Department of Defense to the USAF to make available, tailored support, for pre-deployment; deployment; 
post-deployment; integration and combat stress reactions.  There is an urgent need to provide various forms of early psychological intervention as part of the first response to the traumatic events of pre and post deployment.  Contractor will provide various workshops and consultation and clinical supervision on evidenced-based treatment of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

2.  Description of Services:  This contract will involve the development and delivery of one Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) two-day clinical training workshop and two within the Continental United States (CONUS) two-day clinical training workshop for military mental health providers (MHPs), which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.  The goal of these workshops is to train military MHPs to provide Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) treatment for active duty military members with combat-related ASD and PTSD.

2.1 Workshop Materials will be developed that are specifically tailored for the CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD in United States (U. S.) military personnel in both deployed and garrison settings.  This will include the creation of workshop handouts, reprints of scientific publications, clinical assessment materials, psychological measures and a provider?s treatment manual.  The contractor will provide relevant clinical training workshop and consultation materials during training to each attendee in hard copy and/or electronic media form.  

2.2 CONUS CPT Clinical Training Workshops:  Conduct one two-day CONUS CPT clinical training workshops and one two-day CONUS master clinical training workshop at the following locations and dates:  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous  expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.

   Langley Air Force Base (AFB), Virginia; 22-23 January 2008
   Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC), Lackland AFB, Texas; 19-20 February 2008

The workshops will include a review of evidence-based interventions for ASD and PTSD with a specific emphasis on CPT.  Approximately twenty-five to seventy-five military mental health providers will attend each workshop and attendees will receive training in the assessment and CPT treatment of ASD and PTSD in CONUS and deployed locations.  Clinical case examples, including audiotapes of treatment sessions of active-duty military patients with PTSD and ASD who were treated in Iraq, will be reviewed.  Attendees will be provided copies of assessment tools and a treatment manual for CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD.  The Government reserves the right to readjust the workshop dates in accordance with military and ops tempo demands.

2.3 OCONUS CPT Clinical Training Workshop:  Conduct one two-day OCONUS clinical training workshop at Aviano, Italy, 21 through 22 August 2007 for military MHPs, which includes psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.  The goal of the workshop is to train military MHPs to provide CPT treatment for active duty military members with combat-related ASD and PTSD.  The Contractor will provide the necessary materials as outlined in paragraph 2.1 for each appropriate workshop.  The Contractor will be compensated for one rest day prior to the start of the OCONUS workshops to allow for jet lag.  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.
 
3.  CPT Clinical Consultation:

3.1 This contract will involve providing clinical consultation of approximately two hundred military MHPs, which include psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, upon completion of a two-day CPT training workshop on evidenced-based treatment of PTSD.  Clinical consultation will be conducted by telephone for those providers located in the OCONUS and CONUS areas.  Telephone consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned medical treatment facility (MTF).  It is anticipated that some of these cases will be located within CONUS; while others will located OCONUS, including individuals deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  For all consultation activities, guidelines will be followed to ensure privacy and confidentiality of all patient information.  For consultation with deployed providers, proper guidance and procedures will be followed in accordance with Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities (CIMGR), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-101 and Communications Security (COMSEC), AFI 33-201, Volume (V) 1.

In-person supervision of cases and joint assessment and treatment will be available for patients treated at the WHMC, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, as requested by the military MHP.  The consultation format will allow for both individual, as well as, small group consultation.  

3.2 This contract will also involve providing consultation to approximately twenty-five to seventy-five military MHPs; which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, upon completion of the two-day master clinical CPT training workshop on evidence-based treatment of PTSD.  These individuals will be training to serve as future PTSD case supervisors and will require more extensive consultation than those attending the three-day workshop.  Clinical consultation will be conducted by telephone for those providers located in the OCONUS and CONUS areas.  Telephone consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned medical treatment facility (MTF).  Consultation will also include the review of audiotape and videotape assessment and treatment cases, for which patients provide written consent for this clinical consultation.

<DESC>1.  Background:
The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to taking care of its own.  Our Air Force (AF) members and their families deserve the best support possible.  AF readiness targets combat stress reactions, deployment environment and deployment-related stressors. Tailored support of the base helping agencies targets deployment challenges and engages the services of base helping agencies.  The AF community is represented by several agencies, one of which is the Office of the Surgeon General (SG), Community Behavioral Health Division (CBHD).  

The USAF SG CBHD provides military readiness support through management of various programs engaged in individual, family and community health initiatives.  These programs include Family Advocacy; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment/Demand Reduction; Education and Development Intervention Services/ Special Needs; and Suicide Prevention.  Their objective is to address intervention and prevention strategies for common modifiable behavioral risk factors.  

The challenge is recognizing the stressful situations of military members; specific behaviors and concerns related to deployment stress.  Congress has provided funding through the Department of Defense to the USAF to make available, tailored support, for pre-deployment; deployment; 
Post-deployment; integration and combat stress reactions.  There is an urgent need to provide various forms of early psychological intervention as part of the first response to the traumatic events of pre and post deployment.  The Contractor will provide various workshops and consultation and clinical supervision on evidenced-based treatment of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

2.  Description of Services:  This contract will involve the development and delivery of one Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) three-day clinical training workshop, seven Continental United States (CONUS) three-day clinical training workshops and one four-day master clinician training workshop for military mental health providers (MHPs), which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.  The goal of these workshops is to train military MHPs to provide prolonged exposure therapy (PET) for active duty military members with combat-related ASD and PTSD.

2.1 Workshop Materials will be developed that are specifically tailored for the PET treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD in United States (U. S.) military personnel in both deployed and garrison settings.  This will include the creation of workshop handouts, reprints of scientific publications, clinical assessment materials, psychological measures and a provider?s treatment manual.  The contractor will provide relevant clinical training workshop and consultation materials during training to each attendee in hard copy and/or electronic media form.

2.2 CONUS PET Clinical Training Workshops:  Conduct seven three-day CONUS clinical training workshops and one four-day CONUS master clinical training workshop at the following locations and dates.  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.

Drury Inn & Suites ? San Antonio, Texas ? 24 through 26 August 2007
	Drury Inn & Suites ? San Antonio, Texas ? 11 through 14 September 2007
Drury Inn & Suites ? San Antonio, Texas ? 22 through 28 September 2007
Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi ?  27 through 29 November 2007
Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas ? 22 through 24 January 2008

Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio ? 11 through 13 March 2008
Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland ? 15 through 17 April 2008

The workshops will include a review of evidence-based interventions for ASD and PTSD with a specific emphasis on PET.  Approximately twenty-five to fifty military providers will attend each workshop and attendees will receive training in the assessment and PET treatment of ASD and PTSD in CONUS and deployed locations.  Clinical case examples, including audiotapes of treatment sessions of active-duty military patients with ASD and PTSD who were treated in Iraq, will be reviewed.  Attendees will be provided copies of assessment tools and a treatment manual for PET treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD.  The Government reserves the right to readjust the workshop dates in accordance with military and ops tempo demands.

2.3	OCONUS PET Clinical Training Workshop:  Conduct one three-day OCONUS clinical training workshop at a hotel in Maui, Hawaii from 31 July 2007 through 2 August 2007.  Contractor will be compensated for one rest day prior to the start of the OCONUS workshops to allow for jet lag.  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.
 
3.  PET Clinical Consultation:

3.1 This contract will involve providing clinical consultation of approximately two hundred military MHPs, which include psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, upon completion of a three-day PET training workshop on evidenced-based treatment of PTSD.  Clinical consultation will be conducted using face-to-face consultation for those providers located in the San Antonio, Texas area who are able to meet in person.  Telephone consultation will be used for those providers located outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned medical treatment facility (MTF).  It is anticipated that some of these cases will be located within CONUS; while others will located OCONUS, including individuals deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  For all consultation activities, guidelines will be followed to ensure privacy and confidentiality of all patient information.  For consultation with deployed providers, proper guidance and procedures will be followed in accordance with Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities (CIMGR), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-101 and Communications Security (COMSEC), AFI 33-201, Volume (V) 1.

3.2	This contract will also involve providing consultation to approximately twenty-five military MHPs; which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, upon completion of the four-day master clinical PET training workshop on evidence-based treatment of PTSD.  These individuals will be training to serve as future PTSD case supervisors and will require more extensive consultation than those attending the three-day workshop.  Clinical consultation will be conducted using face-to-face consultation for those providers located in the San Antonio, Texas area for those who are able to meet in person.  Telephone consultation will be used for those providers located outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Consultation will also include the review of audiotape and videotape assessment and treatment cases, for which patients provide written consent for this clinical consultation. Consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned MTF.  It is anticipated that some of these cases will be located within CONUS, while others will be located OCONUS, including individuals deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations in support of OIF and OEF.  For all consultation activities, guidelines will be followed to ensure privacy and confidentiality of all patient information.  For consultation with deployed providers, proper guidance and procedures will be followed in accordance with Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities, (CIMGR), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-101 and Communications Security, (COMSEC), AFI 33-201, Volume (V) 1.

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, material,  	   
and equipment necessary to successfully perform 
business management, systems engineering, software 
development and prototype development for the Micro 
Compass Magnetometer (MCM).  Equipment provided by 
the Contractor includes tools for micro electromechanical 
system (MEMS) design, lithographic, deposition and 
processing; silicon MEMS fabrication; measurement and 
test; and packaging.
***See attached solicitation package for complete details***
***Amend 01 - Contact Rachel Hier via email to request a copy of the solicitation package.***
***Amend 02 - Corrected Section M***Section M Evaluation Factors for Award
Directions, Basis for Award and Contractor Guidelines: 
All prospective Offerors should prepare a detailed response to this RFQ based on the objectives and requirements identified. The Government?s contract objective is to obtain the highest technical quality necessary to develop and demonstrate a Microcompass Magnetometer (MCM) involving Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS) realizations of ultrasensitive magnetometers, with a realistic and reasonable cost. To meet this objective the GSA anticipates awarding a single commercial purchase order to the sole responsible offeror, whose offer conforming to the solicitation, judged to represent the ?Best Value? to the Government. 
 
The Contracting Officer will make a best value determination with the assistance of BCBL-H technical personnel, considering both price and non-price factors. This evaluation will include past performance and experience as described in the below detailed evaluation criteria and other Department of Defense policies, procedures, and directives. 
 
Offerors will receive an overall rating for each area of evaluation in relation to the non-cost/price and cost/price areas of assessment by the respective evaluation panels. The non-cost/price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. 
 
Selection and Evaluation Criteria: The selection and evaluation criteria for the non-cost/price and cost/price evaluation areas are outlined below. Each area of evaluation will include an assessment of risk (see General Note 7). Offerors are hereby notified that the evaluation factors and major sub factors within each area are identified below. This document contains sufficient evaluation criteria that offerors can draw adequate correlation between the stated evaluation criteria herein and any sub factors that may be evaluated equally for all responsive quotations received. It is essential that offerors furnish the Government with adequate and specific quotations. Cursory responses or responses which merely reiterate or reformulate Section C will not be considered as being responsive to this solicitation. 
 
Offerors are advised that any evaluation sub factors receiving a ?Marginal? or ?Unsatisfactory? rating may have a disproportionate negative impact on the overall factor rating and/or risk assessment.  Any quotes failing to offer a solution to one or more sub factors may be deemed not to have met the minimum mandatory requirements and may be eliminated from further consideration. Any offeror eliminated from further consideration will be notified as soon as practicable by the Contracting Officer. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Non-Cost/Price Factors: 
 
Factor:  Technical Solution and Management Approach: The evaluation of an offeror?s Technical Solution and Management Approach shall be based on the offeror?s demonstrated ability to accomplish the requirements identified in Section C in a timely, comprehensive, and successful manner. In addition, the Government will assess the offeror?s understanding of the requirement and Government objectives. Offerors should clearly describe, through the submission of a detailed Statement of Work, their ability to achieve or exceed the required performance standards, establish quality assurance and maintain quality control and display their ability to manage The Micro-Compass Magnetometer (see General Note 1). 
 
Sub factor:  Quality Assurance and Quality Control: Evaluation of the offeror?s proposed quality assurance and quality control plan and/or procedures shall assess the degree to which the offeror?s planned quality assurance and quality control planned approach demonstrates their ability to successfully ensure proper completion of all required or proposed objectives. Offeror?s should include a description and method, including automated tools, reconcilable reports, and/or manual reports by which the requirements identified in Section C will be achieved or exceeded. 
 
Factor:  Past Performance and Past Experience: The Government will evaluate both an offeror?s ?Past Performance,? which relates to how well a contractor performs on projects, and its ?Past Experience,? which relates to whether or not the contractor has performed the same or similar work. The Government considers past performance and past experience as key indicators for predicting future performance.  Offerors with absence or no past performance history will not be disqualified; however; past performance is a critical factor in this solicitation. Offerors with no recent or relevant performance history will receive a neutral rating in this area of evaluation. A neutral rating could be considered less favorable than a favorable past performance score (see Attachment #2).
 
Sub factor:  Past Performance: For the purpose of evaluation of past performance, offerors shall define their business arrangements and relationships such as joint ventures, teaming partners (arrangements) and major subcontractors. Each offeror shall provide two recent, relevant examples of past performance.  Include the name of the project, point-of-contact names with phone number and email addresses, contract dollar amount and periods of performance. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Cost/Price Factors: 
 
The Government will conduct an appropriate cost/price analysis to determine whether the proposed cost/price is fair and reasonable. Cost or price becomes more significant between offers as the evaluated non-cost/price quotations of offerors reach equality (see General Note 2). 
 
Factor:  Cost Realism and Completeness: The Government will evaluate the degree to which the offeror?s proposed total cost/price is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and if the offeror?s cost/price quotation is consistent with the various elements of the offeror?s technical proposal, considering the required level of effort. The offeror?s cost/price quotation will also be evaluated for completeness or responsiveness in addressing all Government requirements and/or proposed solutions. Cost/price must be submitted in sufficient detail to allow traceability and a complete analysis and evaluation of all elements. 
 
Offerors cost/price quotations will be compared against all aspects of the technical proposal and the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) to aid in determining cost/price reasonableness. Areas to be considered will include, but not be limited to: clarity of proposed cost/price elements, cost increases and/or decreases (over runs and/or under runs), experience on previous and/or current contracts, past/present cost savings and variation of cost/price as it relates to the IGCE, historical data and/or current market analysis. 
 
Factor:  Cost Reasonableness: Degree to which offeror?s proposed total cost/price is reasonable. The cost reasonable evaluation will take into consideration the results of the cost realism analysis and overall cost reasonableness based upon the total proposed prices and the degree to which the offeror?s proposed costs/prices indicate a clear understanding of and sound approach to meeting the objectives and requirements of this solicitation. The Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superior performance prospects of any quotation. 
 
The Government does not anticipate the need to request additional information after the closing date of the RFQ; however, clarifications and/or discussions may be required. Offerors should identify within their cost/price quotation and technical proposal, the appropriate point of contact(s) should clarifications or discussions become required. 
 
Late Quotation Provision: In order for your quotation to be considered for award by the Government, your quotation must be received by the Contracting Officer at the place and time specified, or it will be considered late and handled in accordance with FAR 15.208.

Note 1: The Government reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation and issue a new solicitation with respect to any individual item in the event quotations received and the Government's requirements indicate that alternative services, technical approaches or different quantities of services should be acquired. 
 
Note 2: Cost/price is a substantial evaluation criterion and offerors are hereby notified that upon an in-depth technical evaluation, appropriate scores will be assigned in non-price/non-cost areas. Cost/price scores will be assigned by formula. The lowest acceptable proposed cost/price to the Government will receive the highest cost/price score. The higher proposed costs/prices will receive proportionately lower scores. After adding each offeror's scores for cost/price and other areas, award will be made to the offeror which receives the highest total weighted score. However, the Government reserves the right to examine the technical point scores to determine whether a point differential between offerors represents any actual significant difference in technical merit. If it does not, then award may be made to an offeror with a lower cost or priced quotation, even though its total weighted point score is lower. Additionally, all offerors are hereby notified that an acceptable quotation with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced quotation provides the Government a greater overall benefit. 
 
Note 3: The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award a contract immediately following the conclusion of the evaluation of initial offers without clarifications, discussions or negotiations if determined in the best interest of the Government by the Contracting Officer. Therefore, it is critical that each offeror be fully responsive to the solicitation, its provisions and submits its best quotation initially. 
 
Note 4: Proposal and/or quotation information submitted may be used to assess other areas of evaluation regarding cost/price and/or non-price factors. 
 
Note 5: Non-price factors will be reviewed to determine consistency with cost/price factors and to assess the offeror?s understanding of the overall project as outlined in this RFQ.

Note 6: Each offeror should strive to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government that the offeror has provided a technical solution and management approach that will ensure successful performance of all objectives. 
 
Note 7: The Government will conduct an assessment of risk for all quotations received. Risk is defined as the likelihood that the Offeror?s proposed solution would successfully meet the requirements identified. Evaluation of the Offeror?s ability to mange risks shall be demonstrated by detailing how each of the risks associated with this BCBL-H objective can be mitigated through corrective actions, work around alternatives, scheduling, program management alternatives, scheduling, costing, trending, impacts, etc. Risk will be evaluated throughout the evaluation process and will include but not be limited to considerations of management actions, company policies, knowledge and specific experience in the business management, systems engineering, software development and prototype development for the Micro Compass Magnetometer and any other method by which the offeror is able to demonstrate its ability to manage risks and reduce the impacts and/or costs to the Government. In addition, any identified risk within any aspect of an Offeror?s proposed solution will be analyzed as to its potential impact and/or cost to the BCBL-H mission and Government. 
***Amend 03 - Clarification of Contract Type*** As described in Section L, FAR Clause 52.216-1, the Government contemplates award of a Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) contract.  However, in response to the requirements identified in Section B of this solicitation, offerors may propose any of the following contract types: Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Firm Fixed Price, Fixed Price Incentive or any combination thereto.

<CONTACT>Louis Hendricks, Contracting Officer, Phone 706-546-2018, Fax 706-546-2157, Email louis.hendricks@ga.usda.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to incorporate clarifications and responses to questions discussed as a result of the site visit held July 13, 2007.  

Question 1: If flooding or standing water prevent installation of trees, during the established period of performance, will the Government extend the period of performance to allow performance the following year?  

Response 1: We do not anticipate abnormal weather conditions preventing installation of seedlings on this property.  Interested parties are expected to take into consideration the site conditions of this wetland.  The government will evaluate offerors technical capability to purchase, deliver, coordinate storage, and install tree seedlings as specified.  If extreme abnormal conditions threaten the successful installation of tree seedlings, for example if the site is flooded for weeks at a time, the Government will offer relief on the delivery schedule.

Question 2: If extreme weather conditions cause flooding which prevent the installation of the tree seedlings, who will take responsibility for the unused tree seedlings?  

Response 2:  Offerors will submit documentation to support their proposed delivery schedule, technical capability to perform, and past performance documentation.  The documentation should include offerors proposed Delivery Schedule.  The Government will evaluate documentation received and process an award to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government.  The evaluation of the contractors technical capability will take into consideration the offerors proposed number of workers (crew size), number of trees per day per person expected to install (delivery schedule), contingency plan for making up days lost due to bad weather.  If after award the Government determines extreme weather conditions have prevented successful installation of tree seedlings, the Government will negotiate purchase of any unused tree seedlings.  This in effect will eliminate any risk to awardee for extreme weather conditions preventing installation of tree seedlings.
