<DESC>The intent of this effort is to seek Industry involvement in the Sustainment and Development of UL/UC2 and TBMCS-FL programs.
   TBMCS FL is a system used by the United States Army (USA), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC) and the United States Air Force (USAF) to plan and execute air-war campaigns.  TBMCS FL integrates force-level Command, Control and Intelligence systems in compliance with the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) as well as industry standards.  TBMCS FL provides automated command and control (C2) and decision support tools to plan, prepare for, and execute an air campaign during peacetime, exercises, war, humanitarian missions, and operations other than war.  In support of joint and coalition operations, TBMCS FL is used to build the Air Battle Plan (ABP), and publish and disseminate the Air Tasking Order (ATO) and Airspace Control Order (ACO).  TBMCS FL is the sole system providing this capability for the Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs); aboard Navy aircraft carriers and command ships; with Marine Corps Air ! Wings and support units; and at North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) Regions/Sectors/Wings.  In this capacity, TBMCS FL has been an integral part in major conflicts such as Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and other contingency operations supporting US and coalition forces worldwide. 
   UL/UC2 Operations is a suite of tools deployed within fixed and expeditionary bases for Command and Control (C2) at the wing and squadron level. These tools provide the following key capabilities:  Work with the Air Operations Center (AOC) to receive tasking for Air Missions and monitor and provide feedback of mission execution and effectiveness; Provide Wing and Base Commanders with decision quality information in near real time about their higher headquarters directed tasking and the status of their installation's vital capabilities and the tools to conduct command and control activities on his installation; Collaborate with the AOC in real time on tasking and resource status; Provide Wing and Base Commanders access to resource information; and Create a flying schedule to support Wing and Base Operations based on either locally generated or AOC-directed Air Missions.

<DESC>TITLE:  NNA04CI14T  SECTEK,  Inc.NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the ARC ProtectiveServices Contract for one year (January 1, 2011-December 31, 2011).  A contractmodification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before December  31, 2010,being the expiration date of the current protective services contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04CI14T with SECTEK,Inc., for protective services on a sole souce bases pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1),Only One Responsible Source. The contract was awarded as a result of full and opencompetition under a GSA Schedule to SECTEK Inc., on June 1, 2004. The principal purposeof this contract extension is to assure continuing continuity of protective services during expiration of the current contract and award of the follow-on contract.Authorization of this extension has been issued by NASA Headquarters under ProcurementInformation Circular (PIC) 10-15, dated October 13, 2010, which provides an extension ofthe previous class deviation from the requirements of FAR 17.204(e) and NFS1817.204(e)(iii), limiting the terms of service contracts to five (5) years, includingthe basic contract and all options. This class deviation applies only to existingcontracts with requirements that would have migrated to the canceled NASA ProtectiveServices Contract (NPSC). SECTEK, Inc. possesses unique expertise in meeting the security requirements of theCenter. There is no alternate source that could adequately provide for the maintenance ofthe Centers comprehensive security program during this extension period.    Award toanother contractor during the same time the recompetition is in process for the follow-onprotective services contract would result not only in a substantial duplication of costto the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, but also inunacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government.Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 26, 2010. Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST be in writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30p.m. local time on November 26, 2010. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is partnering with the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (FCHCO), established by section 2602 of the Affordable Care Act, to evaluate models (as described in Section 3021(b)(2)(B)(x) &amp; (xi)) that: 1) fully integrate care for dual eligible individuals, 2) provide the management of all funds with respect to such individuals, and 3) develop models that allow states to test and evaluate systems of all-payer payment reform for the medical care of residents of the state. Section 3021 of the Affordable Care Act provides a framework that allows CMMI to design and evaluate such models pertaining to dual eligible individuals.
<p>Under the above ACA sections, CMS, through CMMI in concert with the FCHCO, will develop effective partnerships with states by providing them with the opportunity to enter into innovation contracts with CMS that shall result in integrated care models for dually eligible individuals.</p>
<p>The state innovation contracts for integrated care will be structured into two phases: (1) program/model design and (2) state implementation. The primary outcome of the program design contract will be a proposed state innovation demonstration model that describes how the state would structure, implement, and evaluate an intervention aimed at improving the quality, coordination, and cost-effectiveness of care received by individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, CMS may award up to 15 state program design contracts at $1 million each. States that successfully complete the program design contract will be eligible to proceed to the implementation phase. The receipt of a program design contract does not guarantee support for the implementation phase, and; states will have to satisfy program design contract deliverables and meet all applicable conditions for CMS to exercise that option. The state implementation phase would include costs to prepare state infrastructure for conducting the model demonstration. These development and infrastructure costs may include systems change costs at the state-level for testing a new payment approach, development of a more efficient data exchange feed for near real-time tracking of claims, and additional resources necessary to ensure successful implementation of the model demonstration.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION IS RESTRICTED TO THE STATES MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ONLY.</p>

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice
This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice only. Proposals are not being requested at this time. See Description for additional information.
Description:
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has a requirement for the acquisition of expert public utility management support services for the Berkeley Site Office (BSO) of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science (SC), on behalf of DOE contractor-operated facilities in northern California, specifically the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and related sites.  Broadly stated, these services will relate to (a) utility requirements and sources, (b) acquisition of utility services, (c) management of utility assets, and (d) protection of utility rights and advancement of utility interests.  "Utility" is defined to primarily be electric power. The BSO currently has a contract in place which expires on January 31, 2010. A determination has been made that there is a continuing requirement for these services.
Electric power arrangements for the DOE Labs are roughly as follows:  Total Lab loads are approximately 100 MW of capacity and approximately 800 GWh of energy per year.  Power is supplied from the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) / Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec) Central Valley Project (CVP) Preference Power allocation, take-or-pay purchase contracts via WAPA, and to a lesser degree supplemental purchases off the market.  WAPA has statutory rights for transmission over the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) for the benefit of the DOE Labs, and WAPA has provided a tieline linking LLNL to WAPA?s Tracy Substation.  DOE Labs? power is scheduled via WAPA and treated conjunctively.  Collectively, the labs and DOE have formed an Electric Power Consortium (the consortium) with the primary objective of delivering reliable power to the laboratories at the lowest overall cost.  The BSO has overall responsibility for managing the consortium on behalf of DOE.  The consort ium operates a power rebilling system among the Labs to allocate costs in an equitable manner.
Interested parties should have direct experience related to the all facets of utility management, including research; planning; technical, economic and market analyses; acquisition, including cost and price analyses, terms and conditions, and support for negotiation discussions; systems management, including preparation and maintenance of power requirements schedules, rebilling algorithms and procedures; and support for intervention with utility regulatory bodies and courts, including the preparation and presentation of testimony as expert witness.
A five year Cost Plus-Fixed-Fee is contemplated with one twelve month base period and four twelve month option periods. Task assignments will be issued as requirements are identified.  The estimated Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) is 4,485 hours per year for each of the five years. This acquisition is set-aside for small business with an applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAIC) of 541618 and a size limit standard of $7.0M.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be released for down load through the Fed Connect on or about December 1, 2010.  
No other information will be provided in response to any email or telephone requests for individual briefings on this requirement.

<DESC>The Department of Interiors Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) in Herndon, Virginia, is scheduled to  issue a Request for Quote on behalf of the United States Park Police in Washington, D. C., on November 18, 2010.   The Park Police has a need for one, 20-foot long freightliner diesel step van, furnished with commercially available food storage and preparation appliances installed, which it will use as a mobile canteen.
The procurement will be conducted using FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The anticipated award will be a firm, fixed-price purchase order.  The associated North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 336112-Chassis, light truck and utility, manufacturing.  
The Park Police requires that the contractor's assembly and repair garage be located within 300 air miles of Washington, D. C., so that Park Police representatives will be able to efficiently and cost effectively return the vehicle whenever maintenance or repair service is needed.  Regardless of the state where the vehicle is manufactured, outfitted and will be repaired and maintained, the end product and later maintenance and repairs must comply with State of Virginia safety standards.  The distance requirement is a "go/no go" evaluation factor that will be applied in the preliminary screening of offers by the contracting officer, before quotes are submitted to a Park Police proposal evaluation team (which will then apply the evaluation factors on only the fully responsive offers that remained eligible after the "first cut")..  
Interested potential offerors are invited to request a copy of the solicitation by email through corey.gerst@aqd.nbc.gov.   No inquiries relating to the solicitation or the requirement will be entertained prior to solicitation issuance.  
After the solicitation is issued, amendments to it (including replies to questions and requests for clarification) will be distributed by email to all parties known to the contracting office to be interested, and concurrently, will also be publically available on the internet via the AQD website:  http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solicitations.aspx  under RFQ number D11PS18820.
The closing date by which AQD must have received quotes and the deadline date for submitting questions and requests for clarifications will be published in the solicitation document.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure the following items:   Brand Name or Equal to: NIMBUS Independent Channel  base platform (3X4) with the following specifications:
1 -	(62797-01): NIMBUS Independent Channel  base platform (3X4)4 -	(NIMBUS-1ml): 1ml channel 1 -	(56585-01): PC controller (preloaded w/software)2 -	(56212-01): Nimbus MTP Standoff Module2 -	(57537-01): Nimbus Tip Rack Standoff Module1 -	(61052-01): Assay Pedestal 50 uL Reagent Container1 -	(235966): Conductive 50 uL Tips in Frames (Case of 5, 760)1 -	(235902): Conductive 300 uL Tips in Frames (Case of 5, 760)1 -	(56694-01): Reagent Tubs with Lids, Case of 20  50mL, Self-Standing
The NIMBUS allows for four independent pipetting channels. Since our applications involve mixing variable amounts of up to four stock solutions in each well, programming the NIMBUS to accomplish this task will be simplified, and plate preparation will be accelerated by a factor of 2 to 4 relative to comparable platforms.  The NIMBUS employs a pressure transducer to detect and control actual flow and delivery of pipetted samples, in order to ensure accurate and precise delivery of liquids having very different viscosities at volumes as small as 1 &#956;l Unlike comparable platforms, the NIMBUS can detect an absence of sufficient liquid in a source vial to completely aspirate and/or deliver the designated volume, and depending upon the program, either alert the user or take appropriate corrective measures.  The NIMBUS utilizes an air displacement pipetting system rather than a liquid-filled one. The liquid-filled systems are not amenable to feedback sensing  and moreover require routine maintenance - detergent flush - to ensure the absence of contamination.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a suite of product development services. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services have helped a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter a Phase I trial.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to study, control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents (except HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services. (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries, remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive, and product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising therapeutic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of interventional products for infectious disease required for New Drug Application (NDA), Biologic License Applications (BLA) and/or Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Consequently, the DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>This is a recompetition of an existing contract entitled "Services for the Preclinical Development of Therapeutic Agents" with SRI International under Contract Number HHSN266200600011C.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of nontraditional, proactive and developmentally-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These capabilities will allow DMID to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps. The Contractor shall assist DMID staff in providing all support and appropriate documentation needed for preclinical activities to support IND submissions for Phase I and II clinical materials, or NDA/BLA submissions for advanced products. Specific Task Orders will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s) as part of an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with 21 CFR Part 58, Good Laboratory Practices. Furthermore, the decision of which animal species to be used and any requirements for specific pathogen free (SPF) animals shall be made jointly by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and the Contractor, with the COTR having final approval authority.</p>
<p>The following definitions will apply: Interventional Product- Therapeutic or in vivo component of a diagnostic for the treatment or diagnosis of an infectious disease caused by a pathogen or certain toxins (e.g., botulinum toxin); Therapeutic - A drug (synthetic or natural product) or a biological product (e.g., monoclonal antibody) intended for use in cure, mitigation, diagnosis or treatment of disease.</p>
<p>The services shall be directed at the following: 1) diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list; 2) emerging and re emerging infectious diseases; 3) antimicrobial resistant and multi drug resistant infections; 4) other bacterial infections; 5) fungal infections; 6) viral infections; and 7)parasitic diseases.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation for execution planning and accomplishment of CNO scheduled dry-docking availabilities for specific DDG and FFG Class ships homeported in and visiting the Puget Sound, Washington area. The requirements include execution planning; accomplishment of CNO scheduled availabilities; and emergent maintenance efforts. A cost type contract is contemplated. 

The contract will be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (7), the statutory exception justifying the use of other than full and open competition in cases where it is determined to be in the public interest to award the contract to a particular source.
 Todd Pacific Shipyards is the only private contractor in the Puget Sound area that has facilities to dry-dock DDG and FFG class ships. A contract award to a contractor other than Todd would adversely impact PERSTEMPO/OPTEMO and cause extraordinary personnel disruption and family impacts that may ultimately affect military retention.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Wasson-ECE Instrumentation.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.
The Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, MI, has a requirement for procurement of instruments capable of real-time measurement of ethanol from vehicles at its Ann Arbor test facility in order to meet the regulatory mission of EPA, as established in regulations set forth in 40 CFR Part 86 and California Air Resources Board test procedures for oxygenated hydrocarbon measurement, incorporated by reference in 40 CFR Part 86.

One of the primary tests that are performed within the Chemistry Laboratory is the analysis of benzene and oxygenates in the fuel.  Wasson-ECE Instrumentation configures Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) systems with both OFID and TCD for oxygenates and benzene analyses.  Since Agilent Technologies are no longer supporting the older model gas chromatograph systems such as models 5890 and 6980 that are currently in use within our laboratory, to continue these primary tests, instruments configured with updated chromatography systems are needed.  Wasson-ECE Instrumentation is the only manufacturer in the United States that is capable of configuring Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) systems with OFID and TCD for oxygenates and benzene analyses.  
The scope of this procurement includes the following elements:a)	Two (2) Wasson-ECE instrumentation Application: 369-00 Analysis of Oxygenates, Benzene, and Toluene in Blended Motor Fuels.  Should be installed with the following hardware:a.	Methanizerb.	O-FID Catalytic reactorc.	One 6-port switching valve and one pneumatic actuatord.	Necessary packed and capillary analytical columnse.

This is not a request for proposal.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 10 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to David Boris at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513) 487-2109.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Place of Contract Performance: Washington, DC

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

Description

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:
o Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
o Compensation and Pension (C&P)
o Education
o Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
o Insurance
o Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually  in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities  surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs  that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task orders (TOs) against this IDIQ contract. Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in Section 4 of this PWS. TOs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about November 30, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about May 20, 2010.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Acquisition Center (NAC), and the VA Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program, are seeking vendors capable of performing pharmaceutical drug repackaging into various sizes of white HDPE bottles.  Offerors should have two (2) years proven past experience, as a repackager, in repackaging a volume of at least 7.5M-8M bottles of oral solid pharmaceuticals per year.  Blister packaging is not contemplated at this time.  This effort is for "just-in-time" repackaging; the successful contractor will have seven (7) calendar days to fulfill each repackaging order placed.  The prospective vendor should be licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for repackaging and distributing pharmaceuticals.  The prospective vendor should possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) certification for Class III (narcotic and non-narcotic), Class IV, and Class V controlled substances.  The VA is estimating approximately 15-18 million repackaged bottles, of unknown content or quantity per bottle, per year.  This estimate, historically, has resulted in an average of 800 unique repackaging production runs per week.  Repackaging is a service, and is classified under North American Industry Classification Standards (NAICS) code 561910.  The corresponding small business size, to this NAICS code, is established as not exceeding the $7.0M threshold.  Please review Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.1 for a description of how to apply this threshold.  Please remember, earnings of any parent / subsidiary / sibling business relation may affect your business size status.  This is a Pre-solicitation notice; the solicitation, VA-797M-11-RP-0037, will be published following this notice.

<DESC>Market Survey for a Linear Demolition Charge System (LDCS) for the Assault Breach Vehicle (ABV)<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR><BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.

For example TDB specification shall be translated into derived requirements for geospatial source data and a TDB content, design, implementation, integration, test, optimization and documentation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) SOURCE DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING: The contractor shall have the capabilities, experience, and tools to acquire the necessary elevation, imagery, and 3D model data which will fulfill the TDB specifications. This will include but is not limited to terrain elevation, imagery raster data, culture vector data, 3D models, and geo-specific textures of building, landmarks, and other components. These components shall be at the necessary resolution and quality to support the above TDB requirements. The contractor shall have the tools, experience, and trained personal to process the source data into products which support the runtime terrain database generation for an Aechelon IG. Adequate process should be in implemented and track to ensure a quality product is generated.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION: The contractor shall have the tools, experience and trained personal to process the source data into sensor material representation which are capable of producing optimized physics based NVG and FLIR Aechelon runtime representations. Background material classification shall use multi-spectral imagery six-band Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) at 27m resolution or better. Once classified these source data shall be down sampled to at least 16 m and include at least 40 different materials. A combination of higher resolution multi-spectral imagery and reference images, land coverage data and other sources shall be used to generate high quality 1m per pixel classification at primary airports and surroundings. Alpha masking shall be used for seamless integration of the high-resolution material insets into the background classification.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) AECHELON RUNTIME GENERATION: The contractor shall have the tools, experience, and trained personal to transform the pre-processed and value added source data into and optimized runtime terrain database representation for an Aechelon IG. Aechelon IG Overload management is design to detect the cause of the IG overload and implement real-time scene adjustments to restore frame rate after the loss of a single frame. The scene shall be designed so that scene management can optimize the maximum of useful visual cueing information for current operating conditions and a minimum of scene discontinuities and other distracting visual artifacts that could inhibit pilot psychological acceptance of the scene. Assuming proper TDB design and normal moving model activity, operation in overload conditions at reduced display field rates shall be limited to no more than five seconds before the overload is corrected by the system.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) AECHELON RUNTIME OPTIMIZATION: The contractor shall have the tools, experience and trained personal to test and optimized the runtime TDB on the Aechelon IG so that the specified runtime performance requirements are fulfilled. The quality of the resulting TDB shall be so that it's not only free of TDB anomalies related to TDB paging, LOD transition, visual, NVG and FLIR rendering but that it also does not generate any other anomalies which may affect training and produce negative training.<br /><br /><br />(c) GENERATION OF NAVAIR PORTABLE SOURCE INITIATIVE (NPSI) DATASET: The contractor shall have the tools, experience and trained personal which could generate a NPSI dataset. The NPSI dataset(s) shall be delivered and shall consist of the simulation-prepped source data and metadata descriptions, in the NPSI open formats, which were used to generate the run-time database in accordance with the NPSI Dataset standard.<br /><br /><br />(d) TDB DOCUMENTATION: The Technical Data Package shall contain a TDB design document describing the TDB content, which includes a description of source data and processing, optimizations, and additional details on airports, landing zones (LZ), Confined Area Landing (CAL) sites, and Terrain Flight (TERF).<br /><br /><br /><br />** CONTRACTOR DEMONSTRATION OF CAPABILITY **

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager  Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for non-waterproof, hot weather mountain combat boots. The goal of this effort is to identify firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop boots for use by the combat soldier in rugged mountainous terrains and conditions. Interest is in readily available product(s) or information on development that will be available within the next six to twelve months (must be based on a concise and attainable development/commercialization plan). The hot weather mountain combat boots must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) durable, light hiking-style mountain boot that reduces shock impact while enhancing stability and support to the ankle. These boots, though stiffer and slightly heavier than traditional combat boots, are specially constructed to support movement and stabilize the foot and the ankle over more rugged terrain. 2) Provides for maximum breathability and water drainage during hot, wet conditions. 3) Outsoles that provide propulsion and torsional support while allow for breaking and stability while moving down and unstable decline. 4) Able to keep trail debris out of boot while maneuvering. 5) Designed to reduce pressure points and discomfort during descents on uneven, rugged terrain. 6) Prevents blistering during extended use. 7) Neutral color [such as brown, coyote or olive]. 8) Provide for quick break-in. 9) Stiff-soled with tread that grips rocky terrain and loose, however flexible enough to remain comfortable for long periods of activity. Interested sources must, within fourteen (14) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capability. Product information should include product cost, technical information (e.g. technical literature, data and illustrations, technical certifications), performance capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provide pricing for currently available product and/or estimated pricing for footwear currently under development. Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only. Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Michael Holthe, U.S. Army NSRDEC, RDNS-WPW-C, D-323, Natick, MA 01760-5019. This is not a request for quotations. No solicitation document exists. The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or for developing acquisition strategy.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACT EXTENSION NOTICE - NOT AN INVITATION FOR PROPOSAL(INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY) </span></strong>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong> The Department of Education intends to issue a six-month extension to existing contract # ED-04-CO-0059/0005. The current period of performance ends on March 28, 2011(will be extended until September 27, 2011). The purpose of the extension is to enable members of the Westat team to assist the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in reviewing and finalizing deliverables in the procurement's scope of work, including a final report.</p>
<p>On September 29, 2004, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-04-CO-0059/0005 to Westat of Rockville, Maryland to conduct a longitudinal study to follow a group of children who received preschool special education services as they progressed through the early elementary years. The ultimate goal of this evaluation was to examine children's preschool experiences and outcomes, their transition to kindergarten, and their early elementary school experiences and outcomes. In July 2005, this project was relocated from OSERS to a newly-established center in the Institute of Education Sciences (IES)-the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER).</p>
<p>Contract tasks are related to two general areas: the collection of data from children, parents, school/program administrators, teachers, and service providers and processing,analysis, and preparation of the data for internal use and public release. The researchers followed almost 3,000 children with disabilities as they progressed through preschool and into their early elementary years. Data collection began in fall 2003 and was repeated in winter 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. Data collected included <br />telephone interviews with parents of preschoolers with disabilities, one-on-one assessments of children participating in this study, and mail surveys with the children's teachers and other service providers, school principals, district administrators, and state education agency administrators. <br /><br />When the project was relocated from OSERS to NCSER, a number of organization review policies were introduced that had not been included in the original project schedule. The six month extension (until September 27, 2011)will allow Westat to finish the final report and thus complete the activities related to the processing, analysis, and preparation of data. This will allow the resulting report to be publicly released in accordance with IES policies. <br /><br />This notice is for informational purposes only. A request for proposal is not available. Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than November 29, 2010 by email to Contract Specialist Joseph Gibbs at Joseph.Gibbs@ed.gov.</p>

Description of supplies and services:  The trailer is needed to provide office space and a meeting room area for the Grant Village Maintenance Staff for a period of approximately three (3) years to provide a safe office and break area space for those employees. Currently there is a PMIS project being planned to replace the current Grant Village Facilities roof. This project is currently planned for FY 2011. Trailer Size: 12 feet x 60 feet.2 offices.Meeting room. bathroom.Able to hold a snow load of between 4 feet to 6 feet of collected snow on roof.Able to maintain a working comfort temperature zone of 65  to 78 degrees.Provide steps.Provide leveling and blocking - setup.Provide Trailer Skirting.Provide hauling to and from job site. Responsible for roof leaks, thermal windows, flooring defects and HVAC unit repairs.

4.Authority:
41 U.S.C.253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
FAR 13.106(b):  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).
5.Reason for authority cited: There is currently a trailer in place from Pierce Homes and Sales. At this time due to winter road closures in Yellowstone we must sole source award this to Pierce Homes and Sales. For the additional 2 years we will be issuing a request for quote in summer FY2011 to allow adequate competition for the remainder of the project.
6.Efforts to obtain competition: Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: At this point only one source is available - for the remaining two years of the contract there will be a full and open combined synopsis solicitation issued in summer FY2011
Presolicitation notice per FAR 5.2:For acquisitions over $25,000 a presolicitation notice shall be posted on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov unless the exception noted at FAR Part 5.202(a)(13) applies. This item will not exceed $25,000. An announcement will be posted to announce our intent to sole source this procurement
7. Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable: Previous lease agreements on office space has determined that the price is fair and reasonable.
8. Description of the market research conducted: Market research has determined that when we are able to open this request up for the remaining two years there will be adequate competition
9.. Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:   The remaining two years on this project will be opened for full and open competition

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole-Source Basis
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pegasus Technical Services, Inc., for off-site and on-site laboratory support services at EPA?s facilities in Cincinnati, OH, supporting primarily the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRML) and secondarily the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC).  Additional critical work is required for a one (1) month extension to the current contract with EPA.  Generally, the laboratory support will include the operation of pilot plants and full scale equipment to characterize hazardous compounds and to develop and evaluate pollution prevention technologies; sampling and process monitoring of bench-, pilot-, and full-scale processes; and operation of various on-site analytical laboratories to prepare and evaluate samples collected by EPA as well as samples collected by the contractor.  The contractor designs experiments, operates, maintains, and repairs equipment, evaluates data from experiments, and  prepares and presents reports on the work.  
The expected term of this award is one month. This is in addition to a 2 month extension which commenced on October 1, 2010. EPA believes that Pegasus Technical Services, Inc., with its experience in working the current contract, is uniquely qualified for this short term additional laboratory support effort and the only responsible source because it possesses the resources and personnel to perform all the highly specialized and unique work requirements critical to the EPA?s mission and critical deadlines, without any delays and interruptions that would be damaging to the current research.  
The highly specialized work spans a number of critical, diverse topics, and some examples are as follows:
(1) Research into the BP Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill including studies of Corexit 9500 the dispersant used in the Gulf response into both the effectiveness to disperse oil and the biodegradability of the dispersant which is a high visibility, high priority project by Washington.
(2) Studies into the biodegradability of lingering oil in Prince William Sound from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the results of which will likely be used in litigation, and developing standardized testing protocols which will be used for the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan for surface washing agents used to clean up oil spills.    
(3)  The design and evaluation of drinking water contamination warning systems and developing and testing sampling and analytical methods, deactivation and decontamination methods for biological contaminants that could be used as weapons of terrorism against the nation?s water supplies and buildings.  
(4) Drinking water distribution research that may directly impact the current revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule 
(5) Developing methods and analyzing samples for emerging contaminants in various environmental media, which is critical to three EPA programs.  First, the Semi-Continuous Activated Sludge (SCAS) studies will be compared to data collected under a Supplemental Environmental Project.  Second, data collected will form the basis of a report on field scale studies to characterize wastewater treatment plants as sources of Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) to the environment.  Data from this study is being generated under a EPA national effluent study.  This data will be used to evaluate the need for national standards on these contaminants.  The results may be part of a report to Congress. Third, on going studies require analysis of samples within prescribed holding times.  The analysis includes in several tasks which are protective of data quality.  Two on-going or recently completed studies have samples awaiting analysis: Grailville wetland treatment project, and Colorado lan d application of biosolids.  Any interruption in analysis will render the information useless and the research projects will fail. 
Pegasus not only possesses critically important expertise in these highly important research areas, but it also possesses critical expertise in the operation EPA research facilities.  Pegasus has fabricated and refined a collection of one-of-a-kind research equipment, which is required for this critical additional work.  Their combination of research expertise, knowledge of the research equipment, and familiarity with the data for ongoing projects, places them in the position of being the only contractor which can meet EPA?s critical deadlines during the additional month of this effort. 


THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to Adam Meier, Meier.Adam@epa.gov, by November 30, 2010.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15.  The anticipated award date is November 30, 2010.

<DESC>Request for Information for a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition and Management of Services in Support of the TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm)
<p><br />1.0 SUBJECT</p>
<p>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is conducting market research to determine current capabilities of commercial pharmacy benefit management services that provide Home Delivery pharmacy (including specialty pharmacy) services, retail pharmacy networks, claims adjudication, and fiscal intermediary functions.</p>
<p>Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on December 17, 2010. See section 5.0 for further information.</p>
<p>2.0 DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained.</p>
<p>3.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>TRICARE is the US Department of Defense (DoD) health care plan using military health care as the main delivery system. This system is augmented by a civilian network of providers and facilities serving uniformed service members, their families, retired military, and their families worldwide. TMA is the DoD organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefit. This includes managing the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>For DoD beneficiaries, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm) provides the Home Delivery pharmacy (including specialty pharmacy) services, provides a retail pharmacy network, provides claims adjudication, and serves as a fiscal intermediary on behalf of DoD to pay for all authorized pharmaceuticals and supplies dispensed for beneficiaries at retail pharmacies.</p>
<p>TMA is seeking information from industry that will assist in the future TRICARE pharmacy benefit management service contract that will support the MHS. The intent is to maintain and if possible enhance capabilities within the Military Health System (MHS).</p>
<p>4.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This section enumerates potential functional requirements for the future TPharm pharmacy benefit management service contract.</p>
<p>Can industry support the following TPharm contract configurations?</p>
<p>a) Configuration</p>
<p>1) Claims processing, historical claims data storage (warehouse), drug utilization reviews, and mail fulfillment as separate contracted functions.</p>
<p>2) Claims processing, historical claims data storage (warehouse), drug utilization reviews, and mail fulfillment as combined contracted functions.</p>
<p>The discussion of capability should include the pro's and cons of each.</p>
<p>b) Prime Vendor</p>
<p>1) Using the DoD national prime vendor contract for mail fulfillment?</p>
<p>2) Using a contractor's commercial prime vendor contract for mail fulfillment?</p>
<p>The discussion of capability should include how the government can ensure procurement costs are equal to or lower than federal ceiling prices or other government contracted prices.</p>
<p>c) Specialty Pharmacy</p>
<p>1) The establishment of a national specialty pharmacy network. The discussion of capability should include the optimal number of participating specialty pharmacies needed to provide the maximum coverage at the least cost.</p>
<p>2) The establishment of a mechanism to allow contracted specialty pharmacies to purchase drugs through a central distribution point. The discussion of capability should include the best mechanism to ensure the government receives federal discounts for specialty drugs.</p>
<p>3) The provision of clinical services to assist patients receiving specialty medications is an important aspect of care. What should those services include and how should those services be monitored for effectiveness? What criteria should be used to determine if a pharmacy is acceptable for inclusion in the specialty pharmacy network?</p>
<p><br />d) Network Access Standards</p>
<p>1) The establishment of variable network access standards?<br />The discussion of capability should include whether a smaller network would significantly reduce government costs without adversely impacting beneficiary satisfaction.<br />The discussion of capability should include the optimal number of network pharmacies that balances costs with access based on current commercial practices.</p>
<p>e) Data Separation</p>
<p>1) The separation of DoD pharmacy data from other commercial data when designing a retail claims processing and mail fulfillment contract?</p>
<p>The discussion of capability should include whether it is practical and cost effective to do so.</p>
<p>f) Medication Therapy Management (MTM)</p>
<p>1) Discuss current retail pharmacy applications of MTM services in place today. What services are provided, how are these services reimbursed and measured for effectiveness?</p>
<p>g) Data Warehouse</p>
<p>1) DoD pharmacy data is maintained in a data warehouse separate from claims adjudication. Discuss the pros and cons of combining claims processing and data warehouse capabilities on a single platform.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above. To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks information about approaches that could meet the functional requirements. In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.</p>
<p>The Government welcomes alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements including an overview of new technologies or approaches to providing the requested or similar functionality. The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION</p>
<p>Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI:</p>
<p><br />William H. Coffenberry<br />Contracting Officer<br />TRICARE Management Activity<br />16401 E. Centretech Parkway<br />Aurora, CO 80011<br />(303) 676-3764<br />William.Coffenberry@tma.osd.mil</p>

This effort is to provide HTS CLS, including depot repair services and sustaining engineering for HTS pods, as well as a variety of other HTS sustainment-related services and supplies on an as needed basis, thereby maintaining HTS availability for war fighter use with performance beginning 1 December 2011. This pre-solicitation notice covers all CLINs under the proposed contract, including any option CLINs and other CLINs for non-recurring work. HTS CLS is anticipated to be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) for the recurring repair and sustaining engineering effort. The non-recurring effort will be awarded on an as-required basis under separate over and above CLINs. These separate over and above CLINs are anticipated to be priced as FFP, Time and Materials (T&amp;M), Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF), or Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF). The contract is planned to be awarded in November 2011 as a one-year contract with two one-year options (1Dec 11 - 30 Nov 14). The estimated value of this contract (to include all options) is $60M.
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate a RFP with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intenet is not a requiest for competitive proposals. However all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR, Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Raytheon Company, the current HTS pod producer, is presently in production; therefore, the Government will not be able to provide government property, government special tooling, and/or special test equipment to any prospective new source. Consequently, the fulfillment of the above services requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for repair/sustainment.</p>
<p>The letter of solicitation and draft model contract have been sent to the contractor and negotiations are expected to begin in early Feburary 2011. The NAICS Code/Size standard is 811219/$6.5M. Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Jon Olson (Raytheon Company) at the above address or phone (520) 794-2524. The response date to this synopsis is 01 Mar 2011.</p>
<p>Communications concerning this acquisition should be directed to Mr Jeff Mixson, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0456 or Mr. Herbert B. Hill, Contracting Officer, at (850) 883-0180,. Facsimile responses or requests sent to (850) 883-0543 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>52.212-2</strong> <strong>EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement <br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.</p>

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within <strong>60 DAYS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)<br /></strong>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 DAYS; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 DAYS before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed <strong>(5) FIVE YEARS AND (6) SIX MONTHS</strong>.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The National Park Service contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation to the vendor; providing the best value to the Government. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) Q1580110003.  A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  FAR clauses and provisions enclosed within this RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-46 and are available in full text through Internet access at http:// www.acquisition.gov/far/. 
This RFQ is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  All small business concerns may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the National Park Service (NPS).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 and the small business size standard is 750 employees. 
QUOTES ARE DUE for this combined synopsis/solicitation on November 29, 2010 at 12:00 PM Mountain Daylight time and shall be delivered by the specified time to the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park, PO Box 168 Yellowstone National Park, WY 82190,  ATTN Andrea Brew. Emailed quotes are preferred with all required documentation; no oral quotations will be accepted.  Quoters must furnish the company name, DUNS number, address, phone and fax number, email address if available, and official point of contact.  All Quotes must be signed by authorized company official and emailed to andrea_brew@nps.gov.  All questions regarding this solicitation should be emailed to andrea_brew@nps.gov.
Yellowstone National Park requires an electro-fishing unit. The following is a description of the requirement:
Specifications for electro-fishing shock box:
The electric box will be used on stream and lake projects throughout Yellowstone National Park.  Specifically it will be used in our jon boat set-up to work on Soda Butte Creek to sample Yellowstone cutthroat trout and remove non-native brook trout. It will also be used in our raft set-up for sampling of fish populations (brown trout, rainbow trout, and mountain whitefish) in the Madison River.  The box will also be used in the raft or jon boat set-up for sampling Yellowstone cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and their hybrids in the Lamar River drainage.  Finally the box will be used to shock both lake trout and their eggs in Yellowstone Lake for the lake trout removal project.
To accomplish these tasks the box will need to meet specific requirements:First the box must be able to accept connections from our current equipment (raft and jon boat).  These connections require a 4 prong Amphenol connection that was used on the Coffelt Mark XXII model electro-fishing unit.  These connections have two hot connections (one anode and one cathode) and two safety switch connections for the output plugs and two hot and one ground connection for the input plugs.  
The box must be able to accept 240 volt AC input and offer both AC and DC output options.  The AC option is important as it is more effective at delivering a fatal shock if fish removal or egg mortality is the intended result.  DC output must have both pulsed and continuous options.  Pulsed DC must have various frequency and wave form options to produce the desired wave form for optimal shocking in waters with various conductivity ratings.  The continuous option is needed as it often causes minimal damage to fish and is consistent with the methods used in many previous park fisheries projects.  
The box must offer both 300 volt and 600 volt output options.  These are necessary as the 300 volt option uses less power from the generator and allows for extended sampling on a single tank of gas.  This is important in backcountry situations when supplies are limited (eg. upper Yellowstone River).  The 600 volt option is needed when output over 300 volts is necessary.  This is the case in most park waters where conductivity can vary greatly. 
Output voltage and amps must be adjustable.  This option is needed to produce the maximum efficiency in fish capture while producing minimal physical impacts to the fish.  This adjustment is separate from duty cycle and frequency adjustments.  
Finally the box should weigh less than 35 lbs. for ease of transport.  Dimensional measurements should be less than 20"x13"x13" so to fit our current housing unit.  Electrical plugs should be on the front of the box to be adaptable with our current set-up.

Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness and to determine the best overall value to the government. This factor will be judged on the degree to which the proposed cost/price elements are reasonable and consistent with the work to be performed.

<p>1. Vessel: C4ITSC C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility</p>
<p>2. PR#: 21-11-401PCZ037</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies or Services: The purchase of repair parts to be used in depot level support of the USCG VM-100 Fog Detector:</p>
<p>4. Estimated Value of Procurement: $43,000.00</p>
<p>5. Source Available:</p>
<p>Name: FIDELITY TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION<br />Address: 2501 KUTZTOWN ROAD<br />READING, PA 19605<br />Phone: 610-929-3330 x 132<br />Fax: 610-929-1969</p>
<p><br />6. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if they determine that the circumstances of contract action deem only one source reasonably available:</p>
<p>Check the appropriate reason below:</p>
<p>X Only one responsible source and no other<br />supplies or services will satisfy agency <br />requirements, i.e. Unique capabilities, Limited <br />number of sources, Proprietary data or <br />Brand Name Mandatory<br />___Unusual &amp; Compelling Urgency<br />___Exclusive Licensing Agreements<br />___Industrial Mobilization/Standardization</p>
<p>7. Impact Statement (describe the impact on the mission or property):</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is required by law to maintain a failsafe system in the execution and control of visual and audio aids to navigation. Without such systems, maintained by these specific parts, there would be a negative impact on the reliability of sound and visual signals essential to safe navigation of U.S. waterways. The ATON fleet will be unable to receive properly working VM100 Fog Detectors. These repair parts save the Coast Guard from purchasing new cost-prohibitive VM100s.</p>
<p><br />8. Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by Full and Open Competition has not been developed or are not suitable.</p>
<p>FIDELITY TECHNOLOGIES CORP. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only known source for providing VM-100 Fog Detector assemblies and sub-assemblies. FIDELITY TECHNOLOGIES CORP is the sole manufacturer of the components contained in this solicitation. FIDELITY TECHNOLOGIES CORP is the only known contractor with the techniques, facilities, test equipment and documentation, along with the quality assurance capabilities necessary to manufacture these components. When Coast Guard Headquarters procured the original equipment, there were no requirements specified for manufacturer's engineering drawings, test procedures, or test specifications. The items listed on this procurement request were the subject of technical review and no other source was found. Documentation is not available to provide for competitive solicitation.</p>
<p>9. Provide a Statement of Actions, if any, the government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before future acquisitions are required.</p>
<p>N/A: VM100 Fog Detectors used and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard are unique. FIDELITY TECHNOLOGIES CORP (OEM) is the sole manufacturer of the components contained in this solicitation and own proprietary rights to the manufacturing specifications for the VM100. Development of a substitute fog detector would be cost prohibitive as an option.</p>

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

It is the government's belief that only&nbsp;MFG CRANE DEMINING&nbsp;or authorized distributors can provide these critical parts. Note: No Drawings, Specifications or schematics are available from this agency. That information is proprietary to&nbsp;MFG CRANE DEMINING&nbsp;and the Coast Guard is unable to supply any information other than part name and part number to prospective offerors. However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture these parts to OEM specifications are invited and encouraged to submit proposals.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability, which consists of demonstrated capability and experience to provide the services required by the Specifications.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement.

<p>4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>INSPECTION OF CUTTER PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF OFFERS<br />(a) All prospective offerors are urged to visit the cutter and visually inspect each item of<br />Work and to become acquainted with local conditions, locations of items and fixtures,<br />removals, replacements, interference and the nature of work.

Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.<br />(d) The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.<br />(e) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions.

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

<DESC><br />The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Bragg (MICCC-FB) intends to solicit offers for the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) Instructor and Training Support Services requirement. The MCoE is a military entity created as a direct result of the 2005 Army Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's decision to consolidate a number of schools and installations to produce 'Centers of Excellence' by September 2011. The MCoE merges the training efforts of the U.S. Army Infantry Center located at Fort Benning, GA with the U.S. Army Armor Center at Fort Knox, KY.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue one solicitation resulting in the award of two multiple-award task order contract (MATOC) suites. All non-complex task orders will be competed under Suite 1 (100% Small Business Set-Aside). Non-complex is defined as task orders covering a single primary task area out of primary task area 2 and 5 or a combination thereof. Any task order including task areas 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 will be competed under Suite 2 (Unrestricted) regardless of whether the task order also includes tasks under task areas 2 and 5. Only firms awarded a contract under Suite 1 will be eligible for fair opportunity for consideration of task orders issued under Suite 1. Only firms awarded a contract under Suite 2 will be eligible for fair opportunity for consideration of task orders issued under Suite 2. Small business firms who are an awardee under both Suite 1, and Suite 2 will only receive one contract award but will be included in both suites and provided fair opportunity for consideration for all task orders issued under the applicable Suite. Set-asides do not apply within Suite 1 or Suite 2. All firms awarded contracts under the applicable suite will be provided fair opportunity for consideration for all task orders under the applicable suite, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies. Small business firms awarded a contract under Suite 1, but not a contract under Suite 2, will only be provided fair opportunity for consideration of task orders issued under Suite 1. Evaluation and award of both Suite 1 (100% Small Business Set-Aside) and Suite 2 (Unrestricted, Full and Open) will be based on a negotiated Best Value Trade-Off, with an anticipated selection of four (4) to six (6) contractors under each suite.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) and the small business size standard is $7 million. The MCoE instructor and training support services will be solicited through the Request for Proposals (RFP) W91247-11-R-0002 as a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Interested industry participants and candidates may find a copy of the DRAFT RFP W91247-11-R-0002 and Attachments on or around 15 November 2010 at the Army Single Face Industry website, https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/; or the Federal Business Opportunities website, https://www.fbo.gov.  The MCoE Solicitation has been uploaded in two separate batches.  The MCoE DRAFT RFP is inclusive of:</p>
<p><br />&#61656;	One (1) Solicitation form<br />&#61656;	Sixteen (16) Attachments<br />&#61656;	Two (2) XFDL documents (NOTE: Also provided as PDFs in the attachments)</p>
<p>In addition, MICCC-FB would like to invite interested contractors to a follow-on conference (3rd Industry Day) regarding the services in support of the US Army MCoE. The conference is tentatively scheduled for 8 December 2010 at Ft Benning, GA. Detailed information and registration forms for the 3rd Industry Day will be provided as a separate notice once the scheduled date becomes official.</p>
<p>Request that interested industry partners submit written questions no later than 30 November 2010 to Christian.Freireacosta@us.army.mil and Cc: Gail.Williams4@us.army.mil.  These questions will be consolidated and addressed during the MCoE 3rd Industry Day Conference.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date for the FINAL RFP will be on or about 15 December 2010. The resultant contracts will be awarded as Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quality (ID/IQ) contracts with a base period of one (1) year from date of award with four (4) one-year option periods, and FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The total estimated total value for this acquisition, base and all option years, is $458 million. The FINAL RFP and any other subsequent documents will be available for downloading at the Army Single Face to Industry website and the Federal Business Opportunities website. Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for release of the solicitation package and any amendments. All Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registry (CCR). Offerors must also complete Offeror Representations and Certifications on-line at www.bpn.gov prior to submitting an offer.

The purpose of this Industry Day event is to facilitate an exchange of information between the Government and Industry on the JLCCTC program requirements and contracting approaches. <BR>2) To invite potential offerors to participate in one-on-one sessions to answer questions and to discuss acquisition strategy. <BR>3) To provide a program overview of the JLCCTC effort.  <BR>4) To request information from industry regarding an appropriate acquisition strategy to achieve our overall objective under the JLCCTC program.<BR>5) To inform offerors that Statements of Capabilities are not required, which is not the intent of this RFI.<BR><BR>Industry Day:  Industry Day will be held at 3039 Technology Parkway, 3rd Floor Main Conference Room 321 A/B, Orlando FL 32826, on Thursday December 9th, 2010 with a general session for all participants.  (See attached Industry Day Agenda)<BR><BR>Attendance at Industry Day is voluntary and is not required to submit a potential proposal; however, it is mandatory to register for Industry Day. To RSVP, send an email to the PM ConSim Point of Contact, Jose Pagan at Jose.Pagan2@us.army.mil with the following information: <BR>(1) Name of Firm<BR>(2) Name of Individual(s) attending (no more than three)<BR>(3) Position Title(s)<BR>(4) Telephone Number(s) <BR><BR>Email registration shall be received no later than December 1, 2010, 12 Noon EST.  Participation will be limited to three individuals from interested firms, one of whom shall be a project or program manager. <BR><BR>Industry Day, One-on-One Sessions:  The Government invites potential offerors to participate in a 20-minute one-on-one sessions to answer questions and to discuss acquisition strategy. Upon registering for Industry Day, provide your intent to participate in a one-on-one session that will be available beginning the afternoon of December 9, 2010.  Based on the number of interested parties, your point of contact will be notified of your scheduled 20-minute one-on-one discussion with members of the Government project team. <BR><BR>Program Overview:  JLCCTC is a constructive modeling and simulation capability that contributes to the Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training.  JLCCTC is a large/complex software intensive System of Systems currently comprised of Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF), Warfighters Simulation (WARSIM), and Entity Resolution Federation (ERF). The effort requires support software development, testing, and software integration ultimately culminating into a single unified architecture. Also required are Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS). <BR><BR>JLCCTCs key capabilities include modeling of the following functional areas:  ground maneuver, intel, logistics, after action review, non-lethal effects, as well as employing a cross domain security solution.  Additionally, JLCCTC incorporates Government furnished common products such as terrain data and a Command & Control (C2) adapter.  JLCCTCs external interfaces include integration with the Joint Land Virtual Constructive (JLVC) federation, One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF), Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA), Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT), and Air & Space Cyber Constructive Environment (ASCCE).  Therefore technical integration in JLCCTC occurs at both an internal level as well as externally to establish interfaces with other simulation suites to form a large/complex system of systems.<BR><BR>The development cycle is generally nine (9) to fifteen (15) months in duration and the length is dependent upon the use of JLCCTC in a Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRX) or Warfighter Exercise (WFX)/Full Spectrum Exercise (FSX); the introduction of new components; the amount of new functionality; and the overall volume of requirements that occur in creating a complex capability as determined by PM ConSim in conjunction with the Combat Developer and the National Simulation Center (NSC).  The Government will provide current JLCCTC baselines for use in developing an approach to meeting requirements for consolidation into a single configuration managed effort.<BR><BR>Acquisition Approach: The Government is developing an acquisition strategy for JLCCTC and is considering several strategies which include 1) delivery order/s under a PEO STRI multiple award IDIQ contract or 2) a single award IDIQ contract in accordance with FAR Part 16 or 3) contract award in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The Government is also considering using a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) price format.  Some of the areas to consider in the acquisition strategy for this effort include but are not limited to the following: <BR>" Support of an Integrated Product and Process Management (IPPM) paradigm requiring concurrent engineering with the other simulation programs. It is required that management and development support a technology insertion strategy to accommodate evolving technology and to manage risk associated with selecting technologies that are immature. An Integrated Development Facility requirement in/near Orlando, Florida, to support the JLCCTC efforts. <BR>" An unclassified JLCCTC baseline to support classroom training; pre-exercise seminars, unit rehearsals; Army National Guard/Reserve training; validation; and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS)/exercise user support efforts is required. <BR>" A Secret JLCCTC baseline to support Battle Command, Battlestaff and functional Intelligence and Command and Staff training. <BR>" A Top Secret JLCCTC baseline to support Intel training and be developed in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) located in the contiguous 48 states. This SCIF must be operational, contractor managed, and has the appropriate certifications and accreditations to handle this work effort in a development engineering environment prior to contract award.<BR>" A minimum of level 3 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Certification prior to proposal submittal.  <BR><BR>Consider the following in your RFI response:  The Government is requesting feedback from Industry in the following areas for acquisition planning consideration to: <BR><BR>(1) Enhance competition and provide business opportunities; <BR>(2) Determine the contract method to be either Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, or, FAR Part 16.

<DESC><p>Repairs to the USCG Cargo Wharf in Kodiak Alaska. The project consists of strengthening the Wharf in the splash zone, intertidal, and below extreme low tide by the addition of structural bracing and the installation of replacement water and sewer lines with redundant heat trace installed inside insulation and a protective jacket. The water and sewer lines will be moved to a more protected location beneath the wharf and supported from the pilings and pile caps. The work will be accomplished on a wharf in active use which will require day to day coordination with the CG. The heat trace system includes a monitoring and alarm system for heat trace failure. The water and sewer lines will require a coordinated installation/transition to minimize interruptions to services to the dock. See the solicitation for bonding requirements. The estimated price range for the base year is between $ 5,000,000 and $10,000,000. This procurement is issued as a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the applicable size standard is $33.5 million dollars in annual receipts for the past three years.

Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Governments stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website).

The anticipated award date is 3 November 2010. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-46 dated 29 September 2010.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m.

The prices provided for each of the SUB CLIN above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Centers (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work.  Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendors intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee.  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Governments stated importance of evaluation criteria.
