<DESC>PSC Military Housing Company (PCSMHC), acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Combat Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. local time 15 August 2003, at the offices of PSCMHC. PSCMHC intends to employ a two-step RFP process. In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Cannon AFB project. PSCMHC, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Cannon project. In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals. PSCMHC will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Government. The Cannon Project involves the construction of 336 units, renovation of 910 units and the demolition of 384 existing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,246 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government expects to contribute leased real property without any improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Cannon family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.pscmhc.com.

<DESC>The Department of the Army, TACOM-ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ intends to issue a Request for Quotation to provide the Government with a data base  consisting of the measured magnetic dipole moments of some military vehicles.  Using this data base, the contractor will compute the expected target-tracking  performances of magnetic gradiometers and acoustic/magnetic multisensors. The  contractor will be required to design an experiment to measure the permanent  and induced magnetic dipole moments of physically large objects, such as main  battle tanks and armored personnel carriers and execute the experiment on some  selected military vehicles. After performing a data analysis, the contractor is  required to provide the Government with a data base consisting of these  measured magnetic dipole moments and using the data base compute the expected  target-tracking performances of magnetic gradiometers and acoustic/magnetic  multisensors. The contractor is also required to provide all the personnel,  instrumentation, and supplies for data collection. The period of performance is six (6) months after contract award. This requirement will be awarded utilizing  Simplified Acquisition Procedure and will be placed on a sole source basis to  Quantum Magnetics, Inc., 15175 Innovation Drive, San Diego, CA 92128-3401 under  the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1(a)(1)(2), Only One  Responsible Source.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., Hayward, CA 94545,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for the purchase of 1) Generation of Megaclone Library and 2) Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) of 1 million signature tags.  NIEHS will submit three (3) samples to Lynx Therapeutics.  The work to be conducted is based on Lynx Therapeutics unique and proprietary cloning procedure called Megaclone.  This patented technology transforms a sample containing millions of DNA molecules into one made up of millions of micro-beads, each of which carries approx. 100,000 copies of one of the DNA molecules in the sample.  In contrast to conventional cloning, in which an individual DNA molecule is selected from a sample and amplified into many copies for analysis or identification, Lynx Therapeutics captures on one set of micro-beads, clones of nearly all the DNA sequences that characterize a sample.  Once the DNA is attached to the micro-beads, the clones can be handled and subjected to MPSS which generates simultaneously, from a million or more Megaclone micro-beads, sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample's DNA molecules.  This patented, proprietary technology enables many analyses or characterizations to be conducted.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Lynx Therapeutics, Inc.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M..  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that WR-ALC anticipates issuing an engineering services task order against an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (F09603-02-G-0013) with Raytheon Company, Goleta CA (MC 06129).  This requirement is to provide engineering and technical services to analyze ALE-50 system anomalies, develop equipment to aid in the study and identification of system anomalies, implement prototype solutions, and recommend solutions.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.  The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces its intention to upgrade the structural steel frame at the existing 300 North Los Angeles Street Federal Building in Los Angeles, CA.
The facility to be renovated is located in the Civic Center in downtown Los Angeles.  The building was built in 1965 and occupied since.  The building contains approximately 1,200,000 GSF on eight levels above grade, two parking levels below grade and a penthouse on the upper deck. There is no street side parking.

The building structure consists of steel beams, girders and columns.  In order to improve seismic performance for the building and assure public safety the splice plates of columns on the odd numbered floors 1, 3, 5, and 7 will be strengthened.   New splice plates will be welded to the existing steel I-beam column flanges after removal of the existing splice plates.  There are approximately 675 columns to upgrade. The penthouse will also be seismically upgraded with the additional of steel cross bracing.  In addition, the first floor steel frame requires strengthening which will be accomplished by welding a continuous rigid web of diagonal steel bracing to the underside of the floor girders and purlins.  The welded bracing will intersect the steel support columns approximately 28 feet on center and will be backed along the perimeter of the building with a continuous steel plate pinned to the foundation walls.

The columns and purlins are painted with lead based paint, then encased in asbestos fire proofing and/or enshrouded with plaster, gypsum board and metal stud furring.  Demolition, scaffolding, HAZMAT abatement and the reconstruction of column and purlin coverings will be carried out by others under separate contracts with GSA.  
The estimated total construction cost is between $ 9,000,000 and $ 12,000,000. The project will be performed in phases with a total contract completion time estimated at 28 months.
The building will remain fully occupied throughout construction.  The Contractor shall be required to demonstrate a certain level of expertise and capability.  The Contractor will be selected using Source Selection Procedures.  This solicitation is being made under FAR Part 15.3.  The contract will be a Fixed-Price Award.  Offerors will be required to prepare fully developed Technical and Price proposals.  The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals.  This solicitation incorporates documents, which are not available electronically.  Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, and/or other legal entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project.  A proposed joint venture should provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture.  Consideration for the firm is not restricted to any geographic area; however, during execution of the project a functional Los Angeles office will be required.  This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Small Businesses and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.

<DESC>Description: The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to procure on an other than full and open competitive basis, fabrication of a C-band traveling wave tube (TWT) from Northrop Grumman Corp. ESS DSD, Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008-1098. The TWT consists of a periodic permanent magnet (PPM) stack and thermionic electron gun, multi-stage helix circuit, and beam collector assemblies brazed into a high-vacuum envelope.  The TWT will be used to evaluate design techniques to improve tube linearity using newly developed numerical simulation codes as well as to study the interaction between the nonlinear amplifier characteristics and different digital data modulation schemes. The TWT will replace the highly specialized TWT developed for use in NRL's High Data Rate (HDR) Communications Program. Because of the highly specialized design and manufacturing circumstances, and the required sharing of test and design information, the original manufacturer Northrop Grumman Corp. (NGC), is the preferred vendor for providing the replacement TWT.  The original TWT was the result of a unique collaboration between NRL and NGC and the development represents a considerable investment of time on the Government's part.  NGC provided extensive information regarding the design of sub-assemblies and the results of cold and hot testing, including information deemed company proprietary.  Access to this information is critical to the success of the HDR Communications Program, as it is needed to perform evaluations of the accuracy of developmental design methodologies and codes, as well as to be able to conduct further modeling of the behavior of the C-band TWT in high-data rate applications. Deliverables are: 1) TWT performance report, containing all measured data; 2) One helix TWT; and 3) Informal status reports.  Delivery will be to the Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Avenue, SW, Washington DC 20375, within 5 months from date of contract award.  Justification and authority is FAR 6.302-1. Other business opportunities for NRL are avilable at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award a Sole Source contract on a Fixed Price basis to ITT Cannon, Santa Ana, CA for 104 each TTL Electrical Umbilical Cables in accordance with Government provided drawing #76Z2795-17 Rev. U.  The item is part of the TOMAHAWK Cruise Missile System.  Required delivery is within 182 days, FOB Destination, Newport, RI.  Other than Full and Open Competition procedures are being used because the drawings are SOURCE CONTROL DRAWINGS and ITT Cannon is the only approved source.  As the contractor already has the specification and drawings, they are not available for release.  The approval process involves interface testing of the subject cable with a TOMAHAWK missile under various conditions, as well as “wet” and dry testing, since the environmental parameters under which the cable is designed to function include that of a flooded, pressurized torpedo tube.  The delay required for approval of an additional source of supply, including the lead time for a first article, as well as additional time required for the coordination, performance, and evaluation of qualification testing, would greatly exceed our delivery requirement of 182 days.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 562998, “All Other Miscellaneous Waste Management Services.”  The small business size standard for NAICS 562998 is $6,000,000.00.  This competitive procurement will consist of one solicitation with the intent to award up to four Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, though less than four IDIQ contracts may be awarded depending on the Government’s needs and the number and quality of offers received.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, however, if qualified small business firms submit reasonably priced offers, the Government intends to set aside at least one award for small business.  Firms responding to this announcement must show experience in sewer cleaning and inspection consistent with this description and the following evaluation factors.  Evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information, (2) technical experience, (3) management plan, (4) small business subcontracting effort, and (5) price.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors (1) through (4) are more important than Factor (5), however, the importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of non-price factors or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government.  Price proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns,” which gives HUBZone firms a 10% price evaluation preference.  The source selection process will determine which offeror provides the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors.  Award(s) will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror(s) whose proposals offer the best value to the Government.  The award(s) will consist of one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.  The minimum guarantee per contract is $5,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract(s).  If multiple awards are made from this solicitation, all successful offerors will be considered in the placement of individual task orders.  Individual task orders will range from $1,000.00 to $50,000.00.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is seeking proposals from all interested organizations for laboratory centers to provide high quality, high throughput DNA re-sequencing or genotyping for the DNA Re-sequencing and Genotyping (RS & G) Program.  The overall objective of the program is to obtain reliable, rapid, and cost efficient DNA re-sequencing and genotyping to assist investigators actively engaged in elucidating the genetic components involved in the cause, variable outcome, and progression of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  It is anticipated that the RS&G Program will comprise one to two laboratory centers for DNA re-sequencing, one to three laboratory centers for genotyping, and an Administrative Coordinating Center.  NHBLI seeks laboratory centers for DNA re-sequencing, genotyping, or both.  Under the RS&G Program, investigators from the NHLBI community will request use of the re-sequencing/genotyping service at no cost to the investigator .  The Administrative Coordinating Center will be responsible for receiving the requests.  An external panel of experts will evaluate the requests for caliber, interest, and feasibility for re-sequencing/genotyping.  On a regular basis, the panel will identify to NHLBI those studies recommended to receive the services during the upcoming period.  After approval by NHLBI, the laboratory centers will interact directly with the investigators to perform the requested re-sequencing or genotyping.  The laboratory centers will obtain the samples, provide temporary storage as needed, re-sequence the regions of interest or genotype the samples, provide the data/results to the investigator, and provide reports to the Administrative Coordinating Center and NHLBI.  The laboratory center investigators shall facilitate all aspects of the RS&G Program, specifically through the functions of the Steering Committee.  At contract award the laboratory centers must be established laboratories with capability for immediate high throughput, high quality production.  At contract award each re-sequencing center shall have the capacity to sequence at least 60,000 kilobases per year at a cost of no more than $25.00 per kilobase.  The error rate shall be no more than 1 in 10,000 bases.  At contract award each genotyping center shall have the capacity to provide customized genotyping services for human gene variation of at least 500,000 genotypes per year at a cost of no more than $1.50 per genotype.  The error rate shall be no more than 1%.  The initial total DNA re-sequencing effort (sum of all re-sequencing centers) is expected to sequence a minimum of 10 genomic regions per year of 10 genes in 48 chromosomes.  The initial total genotyping effort (sum of all genotyping centers) is expected to be capable of customized genotyping of at least 100 genes per year with an average 10 SNPs per gene in an average of 1000 individuals.  Further, when technology improves or needs change in the investigator community, the genotyping centers shall provide additional variations beyond SNPs and single-base insertions/deletions.  During contract performance, the laboratory centers will be responsible for incorporating new technologies and methodologies to increase production, decrease costs, and improve quality.  Requests from the investigator community to use the laboratory center services will be solicited to match the developing capacity of the laboratory centers.  Thus the first emphasis will be on candidate genes.  Named genes may be requested when capacity suffices, followed by requests for putative genes when full capacity is realized.  The laboratory centers shall maintain the confidentiality of the data and results and shall not use the data and results for any purpose other than those expressly authorized by the contract.  The laboratory centers shall not isolate genomic DNA from tissues or cells received from investigators.  It is anticipated that the contracts will be cost-reimbursement, performance-based, for a period of 5 years beginning on or about August 31, 2004.  The Request for Proposal, RFP-NHLBI-HV-04-13, will be available on or about August 27, 2003.  The RFP must be downloaded from the NHLBI website at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.  The RFP will also be available on the FedBizopps site.  The due date for proposal submission is November 5, 2003.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with TSI, Inc., 500 Cardigan Rd, ST Paul, MN for acquisition of the following items: (1) a TSI Model 3563 Integrating Nephelometer; (2) TSI  Model 3010-S Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) with optional ROM for automatic control of a CMDL-owned TSI Model 3071 Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA); and (3) a TSI Model 3081 Long DMA Column  ***   The new nephelometer must be compatible in physical dimensions, electrical signals, computer interface, and performance specifications with the existing CMDL-owned TSI Model 3563.  Compatibility with the performance specifications is required because the new instrument will be deployed in a duplicate sampling system at a different location, and the measurement results must be 100% comparable to be of scientific value.   Also, compatibility allows replacement of a malfunctioning field unit with a unit normally based in Boulder.  The computer software for acquiring and processing nephelometer data is custom-written by CMDL and the mounting racks are also of custom design.  Therefore,  the new unit must be compatible with the existing software and mount  ***  The TSI Model 3010-S CPC is designed to work in tandem with the Model 3071 DMA already owned by CMDL to obtain fast scans of the aerosol size distribution.  The additional commands in the optional ROM in the 3010-S allow the user to specify the scan parameters (rate, limits), and to initiate a scan.  Once initiated, the 3010-S controls the 3071 at 0.1 second intervals during the course of the scan and transmits the results to the user's computer via an RS-232C serial port. ***  The TSI model 3081 is the analytical column used in CMDL's existing model 3071 DMA, and TSI is the only supplier of that compatible column. ***   This procurement is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items.  No solicitation is planned.  Responses to this notice will be evaluated solely to determine if it would be in the Government's best interests to satisfy this requirement via competitive procedures.  Responses to this notice must be written (e-mail preferred) and received no later than August 8, 2003.  The anticipated award date is August 12, 2003.  FAR provisions in full text can be accessed online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  Agency level protest procedures can be accessed online at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for functions in support of the USEPA's Environmental Response Team Center (ERTC).  The Response, Engineering, and Analytical Contract (REAC) utilizes government-owned equipment and facilities in Edison, New Jersey and Las Vegas, Nevada to provide support to the ERTC in conducting Agency missions under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), Oil Pollution Act (OPA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Clean Air Act (CAA), and other legislative acts.  ERTC services are provided in support of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), EPA Regional On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs), Remedial Project Managers (RPMs), and other Agency groups. The contractor shall provide support to ERTC by maintaining 24-hour response capability for national and international releases of oil and hazardous materials and uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.  Services shall be provided in the following areas: Chemical and biological counter terrorism response,  biological/ecological studies, on site analytical laboratory analysis,  engineering studies (treatability/feasibility) investigations, technology evaluations, process reviews, and plant inspections, multimedia studies (hydro geological investigations, soil gas surveys, risk assessments, field analytical surveys), health and safety activity, quality assurance programs, and other technical support services associated with the implementation of those listed above.   Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor, emergency rapid response services (ERRS) contractors.  Furthermore, offerors that work directly for ERRS contractors shall be required to identify the projects they are working on and, if appropriate, demonstrate how they will avoid, neutralize or mitigate any organizational conflict of interest that would arise if they were performing work for both the Agency and the ERRS contractors.  The solicitation will contain the following provision, "Prohibition of Emergency Rapid Response Contractors from Being Considered Eligible for Award."  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	"Whereas the purpose of this contract is to provide technical and analytical support to the Agency in its development and oversight of cleanup activities and evaluation of cleanup technologies, emergency response contractors shall be considered ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  Subcontractors that have significant contracts with the above contractors may be ineligible for award.   However, if such a firm believes it can avoid, mitigate, or neutralize such a conflict of interest, it may submit a proposal and plan to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize.  If such a firm submits its proposal, it does to at its own expense with the express understanding that its plan could still be deemed unacceptable.  The determination whether an offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case by case basis." The solicitation and resulting contract shall also contain the clause, "Limitation on Future Contracting."  The text of this clause will track with Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternative V (Headquarters Support), EPAAR 1552.209-74 (MAY 1994), except for paragraph (c).  Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows: 	"Paragraph c:   Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract;  (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract;  (3) the contractor will be ineligible to enter into a contract for remedial action projects for which the contractor has developed the statement of work or the solicitation package;   (4) the contractor will be ineligible to enter into any contract or subcontract which supports EPA's performance of Superfund Headquarters policy work including support for the analysis and development of regulations, policies, or guidance that govern, affect, or relate to the conduct of response action activities, unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.  Examples of such contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and Analytical support contracts, and Superfund technical and analytical support contracts;  (5) the contractor will be ineligible to enter into a contract for EPA cleanup services, either as a Prime Contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contract." It is anticipated that a 60 month contract will be issued.  The anticipated contract type is cost plus award fee, level of effort.  The 60 month contract period will consist of 1,300,000 direct labor hours.  In addition, options will be included to grant the Government the opportunity to increase the level of effort by up to 680,000 direct labor hours during the contract period.  The anticipated award date is May 2004.   The RFP release date and closure date have not been established at this time.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number Q3C5AAC0033 in support of the HUD Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R).  This procurement is for a fixed-price contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). 

The objective of this project is to re-benchmark the Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and reengineer the FMR process to implement the American Community Survey (ACS). It will also involve re-defining FMR areas based on CBSAs.  

The purpose of this request is to acquire expertise on re-benchmarking FMRs, re-engineering the FMR process to incorporate ACS data and to implement the geographic area definitions. FMRs are re-benchmarked every 10 years as decennial census data become available. The 2000 Decennial census rent tabulations will become available in September of 2003. Additionally, with the advent of the American Community survey, the decennial re-benchmarking process will be superceded by the availability of continual data streaming from the ACS. The entire re-benchmarking process must be re-engineered to accommodate these new ACS data. The purpose of this project is to re-benchmark the FMRs and reengineer the FMR process to implement the ACS. It will also involve re-defining FMR areas based on Core Based Statistical Area (CBSAs) and recalculating all rents and rent adjustment factors based on these new geographies. 

Some specific objectives are: 
Review Census 2000 data rents and utilities for quality.
Generate adjustment factors: quality adjustments, assisted housing, state minimum rents, bedroom size factors
Determine the role of ACS in calculating FMR details such as quality adjustments, state minimums, bedroom ratios and recent mover bonuses.
Determine the role of ACS in calculating baseline FMR's and FMR updates.
Determine how calculation of the Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs) can or should be affected by the ACS.
Thoroughly research, analyze and help implement CBSA definitions in FMR production.

 The proposed Purchase Order is for the study to be completed within one year.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees average for the last three years (See Numbered Note 1).

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in 
Kampala, Uganda will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 7, Expanded Sustainable Economic Opportunities for Rural Sector Growth.   This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007.  The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf .  A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Ugandas Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued.  The solicitation will seek proposals to design and implement the Productive Resource Investments For Managing the Environment (PRIME) activity through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase.   This activity will build on the successful approaches and results of current activities and those nearing completion, which were begun in the period prior to the new ISP.  The primary objective of PRIME will be to increase economic opportunities and income of rural communities in selected regions of Uganda through significant improvements in the management, conservation and sustainable use of important natural resource assets.  To request a copy of the solicitation that will be ready for distribution on or about February 22, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: snagwere@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417.   We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.

You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet.

However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments.  NAICS:  541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $20-$25 million.

<DESC>The Forest Service is in need of quick plot stand examinations (inventories of forest vegetation) in roaded and unroaded areas throughout the west side of the Santa Fe National Foest, in areas not previously inventoried.  Work consists of locating and establishing plots, and observing and recording specific data for each plot.  Compared to intensive stand exams, quick plot exams reduce the amount of information gathered and measurement accuracy standards, allowing for ocular estimations of most parameters.  The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supervision, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), incidentals, and perform all work necessary to conduct quick plot stand examinations in compliance with terms, specifications, conditions, and provisions of the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a sole source contract with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, 527 SW Hall Street, Suite 300, Portland, OR 97201.  The NCI and U.S. Department of Health Human Services (DHHS) goal is to eliminate health disparities which represents a significant challenge and an important opportunity to address the unequal burden of disease and death in America.  The NCI is attempting to improve data collection among previously underserved populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN).  NCI is in support of several pilot projects, such as the Northwest Tribal Registry Project, to help determine the magnitude of the cancer burden among these populations.  The data is necessary to assist community leaders and relevant policymakers in developing and prioritizing approaches to address the disparities and to point out the gaps in our understanding of cancer health disparities among populations.  The goal is in line with the strategic plans of both NIH and NCI to reduce and eliminate health disparities.  NCI has supported cancer registries through its Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program for 30 years, including one in the Northwest U.S. and the information from this project of linking data will improve the data quality by allowing for grater ascertainment of AI/AN cases.  The unique opportunity exists to identify cancer health disparities among AI/AN in one of the larger regions of the country.  The Northwest Tribal Registry Project serves the upper northwest region of the U.S. and is the central point of data linkage for over 40 Indian tribes.  The Northwest Tribal Registry was developed in January 1999 as part of a tribally operated epidemiology program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) in Portland, Oregon.  The NPAIHB has refined the process of record linkage and matched records from the Tribal Registry with the state cancer registries of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington for incident cases occurring in 1996-97.  The critical difference between the Northwest Tribal Registry Project and previous record linkage studies among Northwest AI/AN is its longitudinal focus.  In addition, the NPAIHB, has developed and tested an effective record linkage methodolgy for matching racial origin with health records that allow ascertainment of cancer incidence and prevalence data among Northwest American Indians and Alaska Natives with accuracy not previously possible.  Currently the NPAIH is the ony source known to the NCI that can provide the matched record results of these earlier years, upon which trend data can be built.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the required services/information, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statmeent of capabilities must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on August 7, 2003.  This acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13 to use simplified acquisition procedures.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541990.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. EPA, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Perdue University, for a Report and Computer Model for Source Identification of Sediments and Nutrients in Watersheds under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The Land Remediation and Pollution Control Division, National Risk Management Research Laboratory requires the development of an optimization model for assessment of geomorphologic resolution (or scale) on sediment yield in agricultural watersheds.  The objective of this requirement, calls for developing a physically based and distributed  parameters model for management of sediment and nutrients in a selected watershed.  This objective will be achieved through: (1) examination of the role of physical resolution and scale on sediment and nutrient yields in the watershed; and (2) demonstrating the use of optimization-based approaches  for sediment source identification.  This acquisition will contain the EPA Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR) Clause 1552.211-79, Compliance with EPA Policies for Information Resources Management which requires contractors to provide compliant Section 508 services and supplies.  EPA source research  indicated that Purdue University, is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing this work.  Such  documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is August 31, 2003.  See numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO SOLICITATION NUMBER DTFH61-03-Q-00174.  BELOW ARE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE SOLICITATION.  PLEASE NOTE: THE SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE HAS BEEN EXTEND UNTIL TUESDAY, AUGUST 5, 2003.

QUESTION #1. The period of responding is unusally short.  What precipitated the urgency?  A short response time coupled with a tight limit on the proposal length often signals that an agency has a contractor in mind.  Is this the case?

This was an oversight - the proposal response date will be extended for an additional 10 calendar days - the revised proposal response date for this solicitation will be Tuesday, August 5, 2003 - 2:00PM Eastern Time.  The 10 page limited determined to be a sufficient number of pages by the technical chairperson for this solicitation.  No, FHWA does not have a vendor in mind for this requirement.

Question #2.  May the Business Proposal be submitted via fax?

Only the SF-18 cover page and the Reps and Certs can be faxed, the actual proposal must be sent either electronically or via uniformed courier by the specified date and time.

QUESTION #3. The Statement of Work (Task 4) makes reference to a "Technical Panel".  What is the intent?  Who comprises this panel? 

ANSWER:  The Technical Panel is comprised of FHWA and State DOT staff with an interest or expertise in work zone safety and construction, including the COTR and members of the Office of Infrastructure, Operations, and Safety.  The technical panel will evaluate proposals for this solicitation, and meet with the contractor to discuss the project and its progress.

QUESTION #4.  A quick review of this requirement suggests that there are already commercially available products that supply protection against  lateral work zone intrusion and  comply with NCHRP 350.   What is the relationship of this study to existing technologies?   Is the FHWA looking for superior systems?  What additional features are believed to be needed?  Where is innovation needed? 

ANSWER: The FHWA is looking for new technology in this area, that will meet the parameters outlined in the solicitation.  The goal of the effort is to develop specific design parameters and operating characteristics for a new system to be designed for protection of mobile operations.  If the contractor is aware of existing systems that exist which will completely satisfy the needs of FHWA, those should be indicated and outlined in the proposal.

Wing flying operations will be at a considerable disadvantage during the construction of the project, thus, construction deadlines must be met.  Only highly experienced resourceful contractors which have the necessary background, supervision, and qualified personnel will be able to maintain the strict construction schedule and ensure the quality of the work while performing the many facets of work in this project.  All work shall be as specified and shown on drawing FBNV 040014 sheets 1 through 8 dated 15 Feb 2003.  In addition this project has been bundled with project FBNV 990030 “REPAIR TAXIWAY ALPHA CC”.  This work involves removing and replacing approximately 17,600 square yards of concrete paving and approximately 8,400 square yards of asphalt paving as well as significant airfield lighting electrical work.  All work shall be as specified and shown on drawing FBNV 990030 sheets 1 through 10 dated 17 Apr 2003.  The construction performance period is concurrent with “REPAIR TAXIWAY ALPHA FIVE”. Project is approved by ACC.  Water and electricity for the projects will be furnished by the Government.  The estimated project magnitude is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235110 with a small business size standard of $27,500,000.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in 
Kampala, Uganda will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 7, Expanded Sustainable Economic Opportunities for Rural Sector Growth.   This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007.  The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf .  A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Ugandas Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued.  The solicitation will seek proposals to design and implement the Productive Resource Investments For Managing the Environment (PRIME) activity through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase.   This activity will build on the successful approaches and results of current activities and those nearing completion, which were begun in the period prior to the new ISP.  The primary objective of PRIME will be to increase economic opportunities and income of rural communities in selected regions of Uganda through significant improvements in the management, conservation and sustainable use of important natural resource assets.  To request a copy of the solicitation that will be ready for distribution on or about February 28, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: snagwere@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417.   We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted.

However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments.  NAICS:  541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $20-$25 million.

<DESC>Sources Sought

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS, Division of Prevention, Traumatic Stress and Special Programs (DPTSSP) is seeking capability statements from organizations to examine technical assistance strategies to help families across the Nation learn that evidenced-based mental health preventive services and programs have been developed for infants, toddlers, pre-school, school-aged children and adolescent and could potentially be used in their communities. It is essential for families to be aware of the empirically tested strategies that have delayed or prevented the onset of some mental health disorders experience by children and youth. This simplified acquisition will enhance the capacity of family run organizations to conduct outreach and education for families with young children, about resilience, mental health promotion, and the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders.  In order to accomplish this purpose, CMHS intends to provide resources for the Federation for Families for Children’s Mental Health (hereafter, The Federation) to conduct a learning academy for a select national work group composed of CMHS/SAMHSA staff and representatives of the Federation for Children’s Mental Health members to discuss and review promising practices and literature promoting resilience, mental health, and prevention.  The framework for this learning academy would involve working with three or more preventionists, e.g., Greenberg, Webster-Stratton and Beardslee.  As a result of this learning academy, the Federation will adapt currently available materials for families with young children.  The materials and dissemination method will be reviewed by family members in order to refine the materials and propose delivery methods appropriate for families concerned with the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders.  The Contractor shall share what is available on SAMHSA’s National Registry of Effective Prevention Practices (NREP) to the more than 150 Family Organizations concerned about children’s mental health.  

This project supports SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative in the SAMHSA Priority Area:  Prevention & Early Intervention.  It embodies SAMHSA’s Cross-Cutting Principle of collaboration with public and private partners.  It offers an excellent opportunity to provide family members who already have a child diagnosed with serious emotional disturbance the information needed to prevent mental and behavioral problems in other children.  

The goal of this project is to enhance the capacity of the 150 family run organizations engaged with The Federation to conduct outreach and education for families with young children, school-aged children, and adolescents about resilience, the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and the promotion of mental health.  

The performance of this simplified acquisition necessitates the following: (1)participate in a learning academy with experts in the area of preventing mental and behavioral disorders in children and adolescents; (2) adapt materials already developed and disseminated by SAMHSA on “ How to Promote Resilience and Mental Health in Children” and with guidance from the Government Project Officer utilize information found in two literature reviews commissioned by SAMHSA/CMHS about preventive interventions for children and adolescents.  The materials may be repackaged by the Contractor; (3) keep current about and utilize information on the model and promising practices developed by SAMHSA’s National Registry of Effective Prevention Programs (NREP) that have been determined to prevent mental and behavioral disorders and promote mental health are available to family members; (4) broadly disseminate these materials to family-run organizations focused on children mental health through conference calls, Federation Listserv mechanisms, 2 regional meetings and by a pre-meetings at the annual Federation for Children’s Mental Health meeting; and (5) evaluate the success of the engagement of family members in knowledge and          activities related to the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and the promotion of mental health, resulting in a final report to the Government.

The anticipated period of performance for this simplified acquisition is for twelve months.  Interested Small Business organizations, HUBZONE Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Business, 8(a) Small Business should submit and original and two copies of their capability statement.  Will not accept e-mails or facsimiles.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENT RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

(i)	10 Pages - Technical
(ii)	2 Pages – Resumes

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) month period of performance from date of award.


*** BEGIN 52.212-2 ADDENDUM - EVALUATION FACTORS *** 

(1) The first phase of the evaluation will consist of a review of the submitted proposals to determine whether or not the proposals comply with all solicitation requirements identified in the Performance of Work Statement (PWS) section of the solicitation. Failure to meet all solicitation requirements may result in elimination from further evaluation and consideration.

(2) The second phase of the evaluation will be comprised of three areas: Technical, Past Performance, and Price. The Technical Area Criteria are:  Development/Implementation of Curriculum and Demonstration of Types of Training. Technical is more important than Past Performance.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are more important than price. Offerors must note the evaluation of  development/implementation of curriculum and demonstration of types of training will be essentially a subjective assessment by the technical evaluators. 

Technical Evaluation:  

Curriculum Development/Implementation and Training Plans – 

a)  Demonstrates and identifies experiences and core competencies with expertise in developing and 
implementing Programs of Instruction (POI) using adult education methodologies.  Of particular importance is expertise in technical surveillance tactics and strategies. 

      b)   Demonstrates the Offeror’s strengths and ability to develop technical surveillance training  
      programs of instruction. 

c)    Identifies a systematic plan to achieve course objectives within specified timelines and funding constraints

Demonstration of Types of Training – 

       a)   Experiences, core competencies, tools, and proficient personnel expertise is demonstrated and identified to  
support the types of training stated in this solicitation. 

b)   Examples of such training are discussed and demonstrated in enough detail in the proposals to indicate success.  

c)  The information provided demonstrates unequivocally the Offeror's strengths and ability to conduct training in the area of technical surveillance.

(4) The Past Performance evaluation includes the Offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the Offeror's record of compliance with safety, environmental and security laws and regulations; and generally, the Offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers. 

(5)   Although price is less important than the other evaluation factors, it is an important factor.  Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the requirements and risks inherent in the scope of work. In addition, Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the offer within the total price proposed by the offeror.

 Cost will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and a total evaluated price for the entire length of contract.  When evaluating cost, the Government will determine if: 

·	the proposed cost reasonable for work to be performed;
·	reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; and
·	is consistent with approaches contained in the Offeror's /technical proposal

(6) Award will be made to the offeror  whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the factors set forth in this solicitation.

(7)Offerors must provide data that specifically addresses all requirements in this solicitation.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Waveguide Rotary Joints for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project of NASA/GSFC.  SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years.  SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high-rate data (150-200 Mbps) stream transmitted at Ka-band (25.5-27 GHz) by one of two High-Gain Antennas (HGA) mounted to the spacecraft.  The HGAs will each be oriented by two-axis gimbals.  The data will be transmitted from the spacecraft to the HGA by WR-34 waveguides.  These waveguides will each need to pass through three axes of rotation:  one in the deployment axis and two in the two-axis gimbal.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Rotary Actuators for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project of NASA/GSFC. SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years.	SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high-rate data (150-200 Mbps) steam transmitted at Ka-band (25.5-27 GHz) by one of two High-Gain Antennas (HGA) mounted to the spacecraft.  The HGA will be rotated by an Azimuth-Elevation gimbal driven by the actuators in question.   The Government may purchase up to 10 actuators.  Each actuator shall consist of a stepper motor and harmonic drive gear reduction.	Half of the actuators (the Azimuth actuators) shall have continuous rotation capability and half (the Elevation actuators) shall rotate over a range of approximately 120 degrees with hard stops and the ends of travel.  Each actuator shall have an encoder to sense position to within one step. The following define the actuators needed: Output Torque:		  600 in-lb minimum Holding Torque: 		      900 in-lb minimum Un-powered Holding Torque:  	  300 in-lb minimum Power:					  20 W max Output Step Angle:			0.010° max Output step rate capability:	    90 degrees/min Torsional stiffness: 		    100,000 to 150,000 in-lb/rad Shaft Load Capability:		2,500 lb axial					  2,100 lb transverse		    		      150 ft-lb moment Through-hole diameter:		   0.945 inches minimum Total Assembly mass:			7 lb max Environment				Pressure:			       1x10-8 torr pressure (space) Radiation:			   400 kRad-Si with 0.1-inch Aluminum shield					    	   40 kRad-Si with 0.2-inch Aluminum shield Temperature:	    	    0 deg C to 40 deg C Operating Range 			    	   -10 deg C to 50 deg C Survival Range Life:			    	    5 years, 2000 output cycles Of high interest are the areas of life and reliability regarding bearings and harmonic drive.

<DESC>ARCHITECT/ENGINEER SCOPE OF WORK Project Number: 437-03-101 Project Title: Outpatient Improvements The project design shall be for one complete project consisting of two distinct construction projects expected to be funded in two different, but consecutive VA fiscal years. The design and bid documents shall be created such that two separate packages are provided to VA at the completion of the design. The A/E shall provide a cost proposal for the complete design of both distinct projects as well as separate pricing for construction period services pertaining to both construction projects/contracts. Areas of Building 1, 9 and 46 will be remodeled to increase endoscopy capability and improve workflow in the endoscopy area, significantly improve patient privacy in the ambulatory surgery, provide a women health clinic area, and increase the number of medical specialty exam rooms. Desk 3, a five exam room medical specialty clinic area, will be relocated and expanded in the vacant Ward 2B space. The space currently occupied by Desk 3 is the only space available to create an additional endoscopy procedure room and to improve workflow in the endoscopy and ambulatory surgery areas. Medical specialty exam rooms are extremely limited and can not be lost without replacement. The project will provide reception, waiting, bathrooms and 14 exam rooms in the vacant Ward 2B. This space will also accommodate a Women Health Clinic. Patient intake and preparation rooms will be provided for the ambulatory surgery as part of this project. A toilet will be provided adjacent to the recovery room so ambulatory surgery recovery patients don't have to enter public corridors or waiting rooms. A patient holding room will be created, a patient/family consultation room will be provided, and the waiting room will be improved. The ambulatory surgery nurse station will be modified and medical gases provided for all ambulatory surgery recovery beds. The endoscopy portion of the project will provide a procedure room, improved patient waiting, a more suitable reception/check-in area, and more exam rooms in the endoscopy area. This project will correct workflow and capacity issues within the endoscopy suite. Within the recovery area, the nurse station needs to be reconfigured so that patient data on computer screens is not visible to others. Reconfiguring the ASU area will provide patient privacy, as well as increase patient safety and improve patient access.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for machining/fabrication for both flight and non-flight hardware for MSFC.  These acquisitions utilize evaluated suppliers audited by MSFC independent outsourcing quality and manufacturing representative(s) as outlined below.  Vendors are solicited on a rotating basis based on type of work, flight/quality requirements, and capability. NAICS Code 332710 applies to these acquisitions and defines a small business as a company with 500 or less employees. Vendors must satisfy qualification requirements as established below:   Audited Vendor’s List (AVL) - To be added to the list for production of flight, quality, and/or critical products/services, an interested company must be a small business with 500 or less employees, must be located within a 100-mile radius of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) as indicated in the attached map or within the same major city and/or county of the city and county where the circle falls on the attached map, must be ISO 9000 compliant, and must undergo a full quality management system audit compliant to MSFC requirements as outlined in Marshall Work Instruction (MWI) 5330.1, “Evaluation of Contractors, Suppliers, and Vendors” (copy attached) on-site at the contractor’s facility by the MSFC independent outsourcing quality and manufacturing  representative(s).  Once a vendor has passed this audit, they will be added to a web-based list which is also utilized by other NASA and prime contractor personnel to obtain products and services other than the outsourcing acquisitions discussed herein. Limited Vendor’s List (LVL) - To be added to the list for production of non-flight, non-flight support, and/or non-safety critical products/services, an interested company must be a small business with 500 or less employees, must be located within a 100-mile radius of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) as indicated on the attached map or within the same major city and/or county of the city and county where the circle falls on the attached map, must complete the attached survey and return to Vic Scheuplein as indicated below, and must be evaluated on-site at the contractor’s facility by the MSFC outsourcing quality and manufacturing representative(s) to ensure they have the capability to supply build-to-print products/services to MSFC. Vendors are on notice that there are limited government resources (time, personnel and funds) to perform these audits.  Priority for the audits will be given to companies who offer capabilities and/or processes most required by NASA MSFC.  All other requests will be processed as resources permit.  Each year or when all vendors have had an opportunity to quote in cases where the list may be extensive, whichever is more practicable, a new sources sought synopsis will be issued.  At that time, vendors who have previously requested an audit but who have not been audited must respond to the new synopsis to indicate continued interest.  The Limited Vendor’s List is intended as a stepping-stone for vendors who may not be currently ISO compliant and provides them with an opportunity to do business with MSFC/NASA while upgrading their quality management system. Vendors on the AVL may be utilized for non-flight work as necessary but vendors on the LVL may not be utilized for flight quality-sensitive work. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. MSFC’s solicitations for this type work will be restricted to vendors on the AVL or LVL due to audit requirements, and individual actions will not be synopsized. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to request evaluation in accordance with the above and submit appropriate documentation where applicable to Mr. Vic Scheuplein by e-mail addressed to C.Vic.Scheuplein@nasa.gov, by facsimile at (256) 544-4857, or by mail to the following address within 15 days of the posting of this synopsis. Include Reference Number 8-ED37OPT-SSS in any response. For further information you may contact Mr. Scheuplein by telephone at (256) 544-7390.   Mr. Ralph Young may be contacted as an Alternate at Ralph.E.Young@nasa.gov or telephone at (256) 544-7219. ED37-A/Vic Scheuplein Building 4705/Room A110 George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Marshall Space Flight Center, AL  35812 This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents evaluated and deemed fully qualified will be considered on a rotating basis for resultant solicitations within their capability for requirements of this nature.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement:  Bureau of Engraving and Printing Web Site Hosting

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking comments/suggestions from interested offerors on the attached draft Statement of Work dated 1/22/03. A brief explanation of the requirement is as follows: 

The U.S. Department of Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) requires assistance to host its public Internet site (http://www.bep.treas.gov or http://www.moneyfactory.com) and facilitate electronic commerce. The contractor must work with the Office of Systems Development and the Office of External Relations to develop software and programming and maintain security for the Internet.  From this site, users should be able to learn about visiting the Bureau, explore new currency designs, and view information central to the Bureau?s mission.  The BEP Visitors? Center Store will remain a high-profile feature of the site that includes a product catalog and an e-commerce shopping cart, allowing users to browse BEP product offerings and select products to purchase 

The BEP website is a highly visible public site which attracts approximately 5 million ?hits? each month.  In Fiscal Year 2002 the Bureau?s sales executed over the Internet amounted to $1.5 million, or 23% of its total sales to the public.  The contractor must be able to support these baseline volumes with acceptable performance rates and be able to sustain 10% annual growth rates.  

The BEP web site at moneyfactory.com is currently serviced by load balanced web servers and database servers.   Traffic is received through an external firewall appliance running a Checkpoint firewall, then passed to a load balancing switch within the web tier which distributes traffic to a number of web servers within a web server array.  The web servers communicate to the database servers on a non public network and through another firewall.  These are serviced by services at various layers, which include intrusion detection, web reporting, and backup/recovery services.  All production components are hosted on at a commercial web hosting facility, connected to the Internet via a one 10 Mb/s connection, and monitored 24x7.  Development and monitoring are performed over a separate network at a development contractor?s facility with communication via secure access provided by Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Web server component configuration includes:  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (SP3), Sun Web Server 6.0, and Macromedia ColdFusion 5.0 Enterprise Edition. The database server components include Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server (SP3) and Microsoft SQL Server 2000 SP2.  Both web and database servers utilize a dual processor and RAID disk array architecture.  Log reports are provided via WebTrends.

Although content management is provided via a proprietary tool, it is licensed to the Bureau and available for use in the future hosting environment.  Alternatives may also be explored for transitioning to an industry-recognized commercial off the shelf tool.

As a discrete system within the BEP?s Public Sales Program, the public internet site will interoperate with other components of the Public Sales System including:  the secure portion of BEP?s Web site provided by the United States Department of the Treasury?s Financial Management System(FMS)(https://secure.bep.treas.gov/); and, the SAP R/3 Sales and Distribution System.  The Internet site will process transactions via a secure server provided by the U.S.  Department of the Treasury?s Financial Management Service (FMS), using that Service?s Internet Credit Card Collections (IC3) system.  It is on this FMS-hosted transacting site (https://secure.bep.treas.gov/), that users enter their billing, shipping and account (including credit card) information.

The contractor will have a two month ramp-up period (beginning from the time the contract becomes effective) before deployment in the live production environment.  During this two month period, the incumbent contractor will continue to provide hosting services.  Therefore, the necessary testing and development needed in order to provide the effective and orderly transfer of all existing site functions (including backend, eCommerce, FMS, SAP integration) must be complete and ready for operation at this time.  This is necessary due to contractual limitations of the existing contract.  

Interested parties should submit comments and suggestions in regards to the attached Statement of Work to the following address:

<SUBJECT>58 -- Aerial Reconnaissance  Equipment for Homeland Security
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Homeland Defense and Combat Support Sector is seeking information for a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Homeland Security Sensor Suite.  Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information on the availability and technical performance of aerial reconnaissance equipment to be used in Civil Air Patrol aircraft.  The Civil Air Patrol is the official Auxiliary of the Air Force and operates a fleet of light, general aviation aircraft over the CONUS on a regular basis.  The Air Force is examining ways to more efficiently utilize these aircraft in a Homeland Security role.  Air Force Research Lab is specifically (but not limited to) searching for both near term (off the shelf) and long term (developmental) technology that will facilitate aerial reconnaissance  from the CAP fleet.  Current missions are operated at low altitudes (1,000 -10,000 feet) in light aircraft like the Cessna 182, Cessna 206 and Gippsland GA-8 aircraft.  Light, twin-engine aircraft are used for off shore missions.   Hardware, software and procedures are of interest.  Typical missions might include reconnaissance, over time, a nuclear power plant, dam, water reservoir, power station, etc., for suspicious activity. Missions might also involve real time reconnaissance of vessels, ports, or other vehicles/places/events.   Sufficient resolution is required to identify the presence of people in prohibited places and the presence of macro level damage on buildings and structures from slant ranges up to 21,000 feet.  System output should include Global Positioning System (GPS) date/time stamp indicating location of the objects in the sensor field of view.  Responses should include weight (lbs), size (ft3), power requirements (amps/volts), resolution (@ 1000’), I/O interface, cost, maturity (in production, in test) and availability as a minimum.

Interest in an advantageous product will be followed by subsequent inquiries to the contributor. Even though this request is aimed toward Air Force-specific needs, organizations that have contributed to similar solicitations by other DOD branches or Government agencies should respond here as well to assure exposure of their technology to the Air Force.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, AFRL and the Air Force will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, especially near-to-mid term laboratory investment planning.  It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet Air Force needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response.  A Technical Interchange Web-base, On-line Virtual Meeting will be hosted by AFRL on 08 August 2003.  Registration for the Technical Interchange meeting is due NLT COB, 04 Aug 2003.  To register, please contact Capt David Shahady at OfficeAccount.afrl.xph@wpafb.af.mil.  Please include a point of contact, company name, and phone number.  SECURITY CLASSIFICATION.  This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED.  The Technical Interchange Virtual Conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.  However, AFRL anticipates that information received in response to this RFI may be CLASSIFIED up to the SECRET level, especially if it discloses current or projected capabilities and limitations of systems as installed on USAF aircraft. Consult the current classification guide for your technology for details. If the response to this RFI contains classified information or you wish to discuss classified information, please contact the Technical POC.  All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.  The Air Force will not reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI.  Reponses to this RFI are due NLT 15 Aug 03 and shall be submitted to the AFRL Technical POC info: Maj Robert Mack, AFRL/SNO, 2241 Avionic Circle, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433, voice phone: (937) 255-9902 x4381, email: Robert.Mack2@wpafb.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>67 -- Aerial Reconnaissance  Equipment for Homeland Security
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Homeland Defense and Combat Support Sector is seeking information for a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Homeland Security Sensor Suite.  Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information on the availability and technical performance of aerial reconnaissance equipment to be used in Civil Air Patrol aircraft.  The Civil Air Patrol is the official Auxiliary of the Air Force and operates a fleet of light, general aviation aircraft over the CONUS on a regular basis.  The Air Force is examining ways to more efficiently utilize these aircraft in a Homeland Security role.  Air Force Research Lab is specifically (but not limited to) searching for both near term (off the shelf) and long term (developmental) technology that will facilitate aerial reconnaissance  from the CAP fleet.  Current missions are operated at low altitudes (1,000 -10,000 feet) in light aircraft like the Cessna 182, Cessna 206 and Gippsland GA-8 aircraft.  Light, twin-engine aircraft are used for off shore missions.   Hardware, software and procedures are of interest.  Typical missions might include reconnaissance,  over time, a nuclear power plant, dam, water reservoir, power station, etc., for suspicious activity. Missions might also involve real time reconnaissance of vessels, ports, or other vehicles/places/events.   Sufficient resolution is required to identify the presence of people in prohibited places and the presence of macro level damage on buildings and structures from slant ranges up to 21,000 feet.  System output should include Global Positioning System (GPS) date/time stamp indicating location of the objects in the sensor field of view.  Responses should include weight (lbs), size (ft3), power requirements (amps/volts), resolution (@ 1000’), I/O interface, cost, maturity (in production, in test) and availability as a minimum.

Interest in an advantageous product will be followed by subsequent inquiries to the contributor. Even though this request is aimed toward Air Force-specific needs, organizations that have contributed to similar solicitations by other DOD branches or Government agencies should respond here as well to assure exposure of their technology to the Air Force.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, AFRL and the Air Force will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, especially near-to-mid term laboratory investment planning.  It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet Air Force needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response.  A Technical Interchange Web-base, On-line Virtual Meeting will be hosted by AFRL on 08 August 2003.  Registration for the Technical Interchange meeting is due NLT COB, 04 Aug 2003.  To register, please contact Capt David Shahady at OfficeAccount.afrl.xph@wpafb.af.mil  Please include a point of contact, company name, and phone number.  SECURITY CLASSIFICATION.  This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED.  The Technical Interchange Virtual Conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.  However, AFRL anticipates that information received in response to this RFI may be CLASSIFIED up to the SECRET level, especially if it discloses current or projected capabilities and limitations of systems as installed on USAF aircraft.

The VOA's Chinese Branch is responsible for communicating news and information directly to the people of the world, in particular Chinese.  One of the methods of communication is via publications.  These publications contain scripts in Chinese or English, as well as information about web sites, and radio and television schedules where the reader can get more in-depth coverage of news stories.  To print and distribute by mail such publications requires funding not currently available.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines those duties the Contractor shall perform to enable the VOA to meet its goals of program distribution using publications while providing the Contractor with advertising or promotional opportunities in the Chinese market.  The requirement is for a contractor to provide for publication and distribution of a business magazine, Business Scene, targeting Chinese readers in the People's Republic of China.  Hard copies and electronic mail (email)-based versions of the magazine are distributed free of charge.  Services provided by the Contractor shall cover the cost of layout, solicitations for and placement of advertising, printing and distributing by mail of a monthly business magazine for readers in the People's Republic of China.  VOA seeks to benefit from obtaining professional publishing services at no cost.  In return, VOA believes the Contractor should benefit financially from retention of 100% of income derived from advertising sales.  The VOA Chinese Branch will provide, at no cost to the Contractor, all editorial content for the magazine and will develop, maintain and control the addresses to which the Business Scene should be sent.  The Government will provide and be responsible for all content of a monthly magazine with the exception of the advertisements that shall be oriented toward business, cultural or economic matters.  The Government reserves the right to reject advertising deemed unsuitable for the market and magazine content.  The editorial content will be business or economics related for readers in China.  The magazine will be printed in simplified Chinese characters and will be available for worldwide distribution.  Under no circumstance shall the Contractor use or cause the use of the publication or the publication's materials to be distributed within the United States.  Any violation shall be grounds for termination.  The Government will use its best endeavors to increase the number of names on the subscription list.  The list of these subscribers shall belong to the Government.  The Contractor shall solicit and place advertising in the magazine.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the layout and printing of the magazine as well as obtaining all necessary publishing permits and registrations.  The Contractor shall be responsible for distributing the magazine by mail.  The Contractor shall coordinate work with the Authorized Representative of the Contracting Officer (AR/CO).

The Contractor shall ensure that adequate copies are available based on the monthly figure provided by the Government, with an additional 100 copies a month delivered to VOA.  The Government will provide the Contractor with the names and addresses of subscribers at the beginning of each month.

Additional Terms: Under no circumstances shall the Contractor sell, lease, or otherwise provide the subscription list, or any portion thereof, to a third party.  The Contractor may not insert any editorial content in the magazine that has not been expressly approved in writing by the AR/CO.  Any violation of the above conditions by the Contractor will result in termination of the contract by the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this solicitation is NOI-RML #30009. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 dated 05/30/03. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, RML, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection. The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip probe array specific to RML needs, containing the following bacterial genomes: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis. This chip is unique and specific to RML. No other chip of its kind exists. These gene chips will be used in RML experiments to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. The LHBP intends to purchase 4 lots of custom probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot, from Affymetrix. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip is high density, at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305). The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix. The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000. The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The chips processed by NIAID are in  Frederick, MD containing the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible with the Affymetrix system currently in place in Frederick, MD. In addition, there is no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT. Inside delivery shall be 60 days after receipt of order (ARO). Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 South Fourth Street, Hamilton, MT. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items; FAR 52-212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders—Commercial Items; FAR 52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price. Offerors must include along with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items. Award will be based on the capability of the item offered to meet the above stated salient characteristics, delivery, price and past performance. Offers may be mailed or faxed to the POC indicated above (Fax 406-363-9438). Offers must be submitted not later than 4:30 PM (MDST), 07/31/03. Copies of the above-referenced clauses are available upon request, either by telephone or fax. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by this Agency.
