<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)intends to  negotiate on a sole source basis with Brogran and Partners Advertising Consultancy d/b/a Brogan and Partners Convergence Marketing, Inc. to   maintain the revenue-generating environmental health information service for the NIEHS.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing market research, marketing, and sales of the Environmental Health Perspective Journal (EHP); EHP production, EHP Desktop Publishing, and all Internet Publishing; Translation of EHP articles into Chinese; and printing and distribution of the EHP.

The anticipated period of performance shall be for a period not to exceed nine months.  It is anticipated that the performance period will consist of a six month base and three one-month option extensions which shall begin on January 1, 2008 and with options to continue until September 30, 2008 to allow time to re-compete services. This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  This action is under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.   Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service do not make competition feasible for the extension.  Award is subject to Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval. See Note 22*****

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education intends to enter into a five years contract, with the option to negotiate and award a follow-up contract of up to five years without re-competition in accordance with PL 103-382, section 405(a)(2) to design and conduct the base-year study of the next Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K:11).  The purpose of the ECLS-K:11 is to identify and track the critical transitions experienced by America's young children as they progress through the elementary grades. This cohort will yield policy-relevant information by (1) providing current data on kindergartners and their progress through the elementary grades, (2) providing data relevant to emerging policy-related domains not measured fully in the prior datasets, and (3) allowing cross-cohort trend comparisons of educational experiences since the advent of new federal laws and policies.  The ECLS-K:11 will collect data about the child, the child's school, classroom, teacher, and family.  These data shall be collected directly from the child, the child's parents/guardians, teachers, and school administrators.  The ECLS-K:11 will begin with a cohort of kindergartners (and their parents, teachers, and schools) in the fall of 2010 and re-contacted in spring 2011 when the sample is completing kindergarten, and annually thereafter in the spring of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.  The ECLS-K:11 will assess children's literacy/reading, mathematics, general knowledge/science, fine and gross motor skills, and measure their height and weight. All children in the ECLS-K:11 will be asked to complete an assessment of English language as was done in the ECLS-B. The methods of data collection will include computer assisted 2-stage adaptive testing, paper and pencil questionnaires, and computer assisted telephone and in-person interviews (CAI).  The approximate date of release of the RFP is October 24, 2007 and the approximate date of closing is November 19, 2007.  Contract award is tentatively scheduled to be announced in December 2007.

Offerors will also be asked to submit technical and business proposals for the following five-year follow-on contract period.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to procure Agitator software from Agitar Software, Inc., 1350 Villa Street, Mountain View, California, 94041, on a sole source basis for the National Institutes of Health, Office of Extramural Research, OER.  This proprietary software will assist the OER?s software development teams to implement developer testing.  OER has determined that this Agitator software is the only know software available to assist with the automation of their development testing to improve the software quality of the applications of development testing as well as improving the monitoring and managing of the testing efforts.     

Software agitation, pioneered by Agitar, is an automated way of testing code. The software will exercises the code with a wide variety of automatically generated input data, determines the behavior of the classes and reports its observations automatically.  Agitar?s Agitator is able to construct the most complex of objects automatically.  The software can provide a specialized setup or input data, the Agitator includes an extensive library of factories that can be configured with point-and-click simplicity. Agitator includes specialized factories for J2EE and database applications.  This feature will allow the developers to add custom factories for specific application. All of these factories become durable test assets that can be shared across your organization.  The problem of combinatorial explosion is a well known problem with software testing. The Agitator software will help solve this problem by testing every combination automatically. Agitator uses dynamic analysis of the software under test, including code coverage analysis, to ensure that all branches of the code are exercised automatically.       Agitation can often achieve 100% code coverage with no manual intervention.       The Agitator automatically detects changes to the code and adjusts its approach to accommodate those changes, saving time and reducing the risk of untested code.   Agitar's Agitator can replace real collaborator objects with mock objects/factories on-the-fly without having to modify code-under-test.  The Agitator includes a Management Dashboard that helps to direct the testing to a point where it will be most effective and integrates Agitar assertion outcomes, JUnit outcomes and code metrics into a single management report.

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. A Request for Quotations (RFQ) for RFQ-NLM 08-006/EJB is not available. Organizations interested in responding to this requirement must submit your software product to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention:  Em?Ria J.

Burkina Faso: SOBFEL Fruit and Vegetable Processing Facility Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assist a fruit and vegetable exporter in Burkina Faso to improve its pest and pathogen treatment system as well as to consider an investment in a fruit processing facility.  

La Soci?t? Burkinab? de Fruits et L?gumes S.A. (SOBFEL) is a fruit and vegetable trading house in Burkina Faso. The company buys from local producers and sells to western markets, generally in Europe. This study would assist SOBFEL in considering two possible alternatives for growing its business. First, the study would analyze the risks and benefits of investing in a value-added fruit and vegetable processing facility in Burkina Faso.  Second, the study would look at the process and technical investments SOBFEL would have to make in order for the company's produce (mangoes in particular) to meet the sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  

Specifically, the terms of reference include the following elements:

1.	Burkina Faso and West African Fruit Product Market Assessment
2.	Assessment of SOBFEL Production Capacity and Equipment Requirements (including evaluation of pest control requirements to meet USDA standards)
3.	Analysis of SOBFEL's Business Plan (including development of engineering designs, financial analysis, and environmental analysis)
4.	Development Impact Assessment
5.	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $151,521 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and French directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, Local Time, November 26, 2007 at the above address.  Due to the French language requirement, USTDA has already added an additional week to the proposal preparation time.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contractor shall use government furnished equipment, facility and infrastructure.  The operator function shall be provided on a 24 hour, 365 day basis.

1.2. Task Description

The contractor shall perform the following core functions:

?	Commercial and DSN Call Processing
?o	DSN
?o	Health and Morale calls
?o	Hearts Apart calls
--    Toll Calls
--    Establishing/Scheduling Conference calls

?o	Shift change procedure
?o	Non-shift change activities
1.2.1 ANSWERING CALLS.  The contractor will answer all calls within three (3) rings.  .

1.2.2. INCOMING CALLS.  The contractor will provide operator assistance for all incoming calls including the military base locator and all calls routed to them by the government provided Automated Call Distribution (ACD) system.

Chart below is a typical operator directory call flow process:


 1.2.2.1. The contractor will have access to duty phone numbers through the PC driven Operator Console application for base locator duties.

 1.2.2.2. The only information the contractor is allowed to give the caller is duty telephone, rank, unit and office symbol.

 1.2.2.3. Base locator hours are 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

 1.2.2.4. The contractor will answer all calls and respond with operator identification number.

  1.2.2.5. The contractor will provide any research necessary to complete the call.  The contractor will complete and extend calls unless not requested by the caller.  The contractor will be courteous to all customers and avoid confrontations.

Call Handling:  

1.2.2.6. Government-official, Hearts Apart calls, and health, morale and welfare (HMW) calls will be directed via the government provided ACD.  The contractor will place any of these calls if the ACD is inoperable or the customer cannot place calls through the ACD due to bad phone lines.  In the event the ACD is out of service, all calls will default to the operator to process.

Hearts Apart is a different form of morale call from the family member on-netting to the DSN. Hearts Apart calls are handled by the operator similar to most known Morale calls mentioned above; however, the process is typically managed more efficiently. The operator is provided a list of authorized callers from Family Services, who provide control numbers for approved recipients. Although the callers are validated, there is no effective means for monitoring the call.



For morale calls, the operators follow processes that identify the caller and some form of validation prior to extending the call to the significant other. If the validation process fails, the operator will in some cases generate a toll ticket and process the call. The recommended times and frequencies for Morale calls published in AFI-33-111 is 1?2 calls per week with a 15-minute allocation of time on the call; however, the local communications squadron has the authority to set the actual policy. DoD policies mandate control and security for this service as long as there is no operational impact.

1.3. OUTGOING CALLS.  The contractor will provide operator service/support for all calls processed through the switchboard.

 
Toll calls

Toll calls are processed by the operator for official calls only. The operator validates the callers Personal Identification Number (PIN) and processes the call. If the PIN number fails, the operator instructs the caller to contact the TCO and inform them of the incorrect or invalid PIN.

1.3.1. In the event of customer?s inability to place a call using established PIN or DSN control number procedures, the contractor will request all information necessary to complete a call ticket on all long distance commercial calls, Defense Switch Network (DSN) calls with a priority or higher status, and all on-net and off net calls (to include official, morale, and hearts apart calls).  DSN calls will be handled in accordance with (IAW) Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Instructions (CJCSI) 6215.01B.  Records shall be maintained for twelve (12) months.  


1.3.2. The contractor will not allow callers to access DSN, commercial local or long-distance services from Class C telephones without a control number.  QAP will provide the contractor with a list of personnel who are authorized access to DSN from off-base locations.  In the event of a Distinguished Visitor (DV) requesting assistance, the assistance will be handled on a case-by-case basis under the advisement of the Chief Operator or shift supervisor.  The contractor shall complete a toll ticket with all required information and charge to the assigned DV control number.  Records shall be maintained for twelve (12) months..

Establishing and Maintaining Conference Calls

1.3.3. The contractor will provide operator assistance for all conference calls.  The contractor will contact all conferees, notify them of the time for the conference call, and complete the call as requested

There are several forms of conference calling currently. These include meet-me, pre-set, and secure (DRSN) conferences, and video teleconferences. Operators are typically responsible for meet-me conference scheduling and setup. Conference call activities are primarily via a meet-me conference bridge.

1.5.3.  Flash  

1.5.4.  Immediate

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.   The purpose of this request for information is to identify companies with the resources and capabilities to support this requirement.  This Sources Sought/Market Research shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal.   The Government does not intend to award a contract from the results of this Sources Sought Notice.  The Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, is seeking sources to provide personnel to conduct military surveys aboard  a 208 foot long, 2,054 ton, T-AGS 50 class hydrographic ship for the period of one year.  The ship carries two 34 foot Hydrographic Survey Launches (HSLs) equipped with side-scan sonar, multibeam echo sounder, Global Positioning System, an Integrated Survey System and other capabilities.  The ship operates around the world (no homeport).  Currently, the ship?s crew is contractor-operated and NAVO deploys civilian scientific, engineering, and technical personnel to operate and maintain the scientific systems, collect environmental data, and validate these data onboard the vessel during survey operations (SURVOP).  A typical SURVOP is 31 days long followed by a 5 day in-port period and 9 survops are typically conducted in a year.  Nearly all operational surveys are conducted outside the continental United States (CONUS). Some of the surveys are conducted with diplomatic clearance inside the territorial waters of permissive foreign nations; the others are conducted as military surveys in accordance with the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  In all cases, the data must undergo field quality assurance for accuracy and completeness prior to departing the survey area. There will be a Senior NAVOCEANO Representative (SNR) on board at all times to oversee operations and monitor contract personnel.  Two government electronic technicians will be on board to maintain equipment.  The types of surveys include: Bathymetric surveys that meet Navy accuracy and coverage requirements.  Primary survey equipment is the SIMRAD EM1002 and EA502 sonars, and CTD/XBT systems.-Hydrographic surveys that meet International Hydrographic Organization accuracy and coverage requirements.  Primary survey equipment on board the ship is the EM1002 and EA502 sonars, and aboard the HSL is the EM3000 sonar.  Digital side scan sonars (DSSS) (primarily Klein 3000) are employed for hazards to navigation detection.  Tide measurement gages are installed, geodetically surveyed in, and monitored.  CTD/XBT data are collected for input to sonars.  The software suite used to control survey operations and record sensor data is the Integrated Survey System-60 (ISS-60).  It is a distributed network-based software system developed for NAVOCEANO's survey vessels. It integrates several systems that support high-resolution seafloor mapping, physical oceanography and precision station-keeping accommodating over-the-side sensor deployments.  The software combines a sophisticated navigation positioning algorithm and a data acquisition system designed to collect, process and record navigation, multibeam, and environmental data.    
It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 25 pages in length, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform requested services.  This document shall address, as a minimum, the following:  (1)  Relevant Experience to include experience in performing efforts (marine surveying) of similar value, size and scope within the last five years, including contract number, indication of whether a prime or subcontractor, contract value, Government/Agency point of contact and a current telephone number, and a brief description of how the contract referenced relates to the technical services described herein.  (2)  Company profile to include number of employees, office location(s) and  available staff resources and management of staff to ensure successful completion of work  performed under this requirement.   Include brief synopsis of staff experience involving hydrographic and bathymetric data collection, processing, validation, QA/QC, data management, and report writing.  Responses shall include the following:  (1)  Company name; (2) Address; (3) Point of Contact; (4) Email address and fax number; (5) Business size (Smallor Large), Disadvantaged/8(a)/or HUBZone Status (Socioeconomic Program).  
This sources sought is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis  No telephone or resultant requests for solicitation or posting status.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set-aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>NAVFAC Southwest will be hosting an Industry Forum to focus on the acquisition of Renewable Energy on Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake. 

The intent of the Forum is to continue formulation of the Navy's strategy to develop renewable resources to substantially meet the electricity requirements at NAWS China Lake. The Navy previously collected market research information related to photovoltaic system development through a Request for Information (RFI) process during May 2007. This Forum is the next step towards the Navy intent to develop a renewable resource on Navy land at NAWS China Lake. The Forum will allow industry to receive input on the utilities requirements at NAWS China Lake as well as visit potential site(s) where renewable resources may be developed. The Forum will also serve to inform industry of the Department of the Navy's acquisition process, contractual and legal parameters, business and program goals, and the Navy's strategic and economic vision for Renewable Energy.

The goal of the Forum is to solicit feedback from industry, government, and subject matter experts so that the Navy can formulate a specific strategy for Renewable Energy at NAWS China Lake.

Discussion topics will include the present state of utilities acquisition at NAWS China Lake, a summary of the annual load requirements, and the Navy's concept for developing renewable energy resources. 

The Forum presents an opportunity for industry participants to grasp an understanding of the Navy's requirements and potential renewable energy development opportunity and partnering potential at NAWS China Lake.

Please visit our NAVFAC website, located at 
https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacsw   (go to Quick Links)

It would also be necessary for this firm to establish and maintain an internet based database that contains information about the foreign facilities visited, as well as allow FDA internet access to this database. 
 
This company would need to provide an electronic report to FDA within 30 days for each firm visited that includes the following: Hard copy reports would also be acceptable when examples of products were collected and could not be scanned.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of providing toxicology and safety assessment services to continue the NIMH Toxicological Evaluation of Novel Ligands Program. The program provides assessment of promising, target-selective ligands for PET, SPECT, and MRI imaging in humans, as well as limited assessment of novel psychoactive agents for clinical research and as potential therapeutics.  Toxicology and safety data generated by the program are used to support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the Food and Drug Administration, or for Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) evaluation of a compound for human studies.  Services to be provided under this program fall into four general areas: 1) analytical chemistry; 2) pharmacokinetics; 3) preliminary safety assessment; and 4) IND-directed toxicity assessments, including safety pharmacology.  Capable sources will be required to (1) develop and validate analytical methods for quantitating drug concentrations in dosing solutions, biological fluids, and tissues and determine plasma drug levels in animals administered the agent under study and calculate pharmacokinetic parameters derived from these data; (2) Determine the bioavailability of a drug after different routes of administration; (3) conduct in vitro evaluation of hepatoxicity in human and animal liver cells; and (4) plan and conduct preclinical acute and chronic toxicity evaluations on lead compounds, including clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology, and histopathology and plasma drug levels in rodents and non-rodent species, including safety pharmacology assessments. 

Capable sources need to have the capacity/facilities to receive and test approximately 7 (but could range from 5-10) compounds per year, in a battery of toxicity and safety assessment tests (as listed above). The majority of these compounds will undergo limited assessment including analytical chemistry and pharmacokinetic assessment, dose range-finding studies and acute toxicity evaluation in rodents.  Additional assessments of genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, repeat-dose, and chronic toxicity may be required in both rodent and non-rodent species (typically dog, rabbit, or primate). Institutions should have a currently approved DHHS Animal Welfare Assurance.  IACUC approval will be mandatory for this project prior to award of the contract.  

The Toxicological Evaluation of Novel Ligands Program currently operates under a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), which allows a deviation from the standard Patent Rights clause in FAR 52.227-14 to ensure the confidentiality and protect the intellectual property and patent rights of an investigator or party supplying a proprietary sample or composition of matter for testing through the program.  It is the intention of the Government to seek a continuation of that DEC to allow the use the deviation in the currently proposed requirement.  

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the above work. Capability Statements should clearly state/describe: 1) the offerors experience and qualifications to perform this work; 2) your type of business or organization, its size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (Note:  the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541712, 500 employees); and 3) your  management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #); and 4) other resources available to perform this work (e.g. scientific equipment, laboratory facilities, etc.). 

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RECEIPT NOTICE WILL BE SENT TO THE SUBMITTER OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT AND NO EVALUATION WILL BE PROVIDED OF ANY RESPECTIVE CAPABILITY STATEMENT.

If the Government decides to issue a solicitation, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available solely via the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It will be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any solicitation and amendments, and to download all documents.

Responses to this notice should be received no later than the stated due date, and can be sent either by mail, fax, or e-mail to either Point of Contact listed.  If using the U.S. Postal Service or commercial overnight services, please send an original plus five (5) copies of your response. (Note: for commercial overnight services, use Rockville, MD 20852.)

<DESC>***Reference Sources Sought Notice posted on 24 May 2007 under Solicitation Number W15P7T07RN209 ****** A draft SOW , a questionaire, and a WORD copy of the below market survey are posted to the IBOP (https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/).  For convenienc e, the market survey was posted on both the 'CECOM Market Survey' drop-down menu with the same title as this announcement and under the 'C-E LCMC 2008' drop-down menu under Solicitation Number W15P7T-08-R-N201 ************** This is a supplemental Market Survey to identify additional potential interest for the Battle Command (BC) Development contractual effort described below. The majority of the efforts described were previously described in a market survey published on 23 Ma y 2006. This Market Survey outlines the previously described Battle Command Development efforts supplemented with a description of additional efforts that have been added to the scope of the effort since the original Market Survey publication.  In general,  changes from the original Market Survey include the addition of: Network Enabled Command Capability (NECC) integration efforts and the addition of logistics and training documentation for Battle Command products.  In addition, references to interface with  a System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SoSE&I) contractor have been replaced with interface with a Government team charged with oversight of System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) efforts, given decisions to manage these efforts using Government r esources.  As a result of that change, references to an Organizational Conflict of Interest provision have been removed from the Market Survey which originally limited the awardee of SoSE&I efforts from participating in development efforts.  Finally, chang es are included to reflect a contract type that includes not only support for Cost Plus Award Fee and Time and Materials but Cost Plus Incentive Fee and elements, depending on the type of work specified in the task order. The effort is still anticipated to be a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with five (5) one-year option periods. It will include provisions for Cost Plus Award Fee, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, and Time and Materials suppor t.  It will be a multiple award contract (with up to 10 awards projected) to provide Battle Command product and service development and NECC integration support across the family of Battle Command products.   The family of Battle Command products included in this development effort consist of: the Global Command and Control System Army (GCCS-A), the emerging contributions to the Network Enabled Command Capability (NECC), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data S ystems (AFATDS), Pocket Sized Forward Entry Device (PFED), Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Lightweight Forward Entry Device (LFED), Centaur, Gun Display Unit  Replacement (GDU-R), the Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3), Common Software (C S) services, the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS),  Maneuver Control System (MCS), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDS), Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS), and generic services within the Battle Command do main. The systems under PM BCs control are undergoing change as a family of products to migrate to a net centric, service oriented architecture.  The selected contractor(s) will develop products/services that support the migration of key domain specific f unctional capability to common services that can be consumed across the Battle Command and evolving joint enterprise (accomplished via new development and leveraging and contributing to services and architectural standards across the enterprise to include those provided under the NECC, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Future Combat System (FCS),  Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) families of systems).  Currently there are activities within the Battle Command environment to define and imple ment ente rprise oriented services that will provide a common framework and environment to support the transition.  Efforts such as the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) development effort provide the initial starting point for migration to a service-oriented ar chitecture within the Battle Command family of systems.   Efforts under this contract will require integration with available common services, leveraging evolving  technology offerings, leveraging enterprise services and providing services to the enterpris e environment, in addition to normal application development and maintenance efforts for system specific functionality.   The Migration effort will be a phased, evolutionary effort to migrate from individual domain specific systems to a service oriented environment where each system contributes to and consumes services across the enterprise and eventually integrates applicati ons and common toolsets to achieve commonality in look and feel for the user.  In the interim period, PM BC needs to sustain the existing and evolving system baselines in the field.  This acquisition effort supports those systems maintenance efforts as wel l. Each of the Battle Command systems has been developed over many years under the purview of different organizations with domain specific requirements and minimal unifying requirements.  Over the past several years focus has been placed on unifying the Battl e Command family of systems via enterprise architecture initiatives that support network centric concepts outlined in the Department of Defense Chief Information Officers Net Centric data strategy.  The tenets of the Net Centric approach were making data visible, available and usable; tagging data to enable discovery by users; posting data to shared spaces to provide open access; and migrating from point to point interoperability to many to many exchanges.   The major tasks that will make up this effort include the following for each of the Battle Command products: "	Maintenance/Development of Battle Command Systems  "	Development of Common and System Specific Software "	Integration of Common Service into Client Applications "	Coordination with the Government managed SoS Engineering team which provide unifying architectural guidance across the BC systems  "	Development of  Design and Software Documentation "	Testing (Unit and System) "	NECC integration efforts "	Demonstration and experimentation support "	Support to Central Technical Support Facility and NECC testing "	Logistics Product development (e.g. technical manuals, training materials)  and conduct of training "	Supplemental Field, Training and Materiel Fielding support This announcement is to establish an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  Interested parties should provide an expression of their interest and any questions regarding the scope of the effor t to any of the Points of Contacts below:  Mr. Jim Cafiero, 732 532 4764, or james.cafiero@us.army.mil Ms. Linda Johnston, 732 427-5956, or Linda.johnston@us.army.mil Ms. Barbara Girgus, 732 427-2947, or Barbara.girgus@us.army.mil The deadline for response to this notice is 15 calendar days (27 October 2007) from the date of publication.

<DESC>Procuring contracting officer, Mary S. Adams (309) 782-4841, Technical POC, Kevin Bowen, (812-254-5397) DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing  Marine signal, Smoke an d Illum, MK124, Mod 0 and Marine signal, Smoke and Illum, MK124, Mod 1.  FedBizOpps Note Number 8 applies.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Gover nment.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements .  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Following is a description of each item. MARINE SIGNAL, SMOKE AND ILLUM, MK124 MOD 0/L283.  NSN: 1370-01-144-3561 PART NUMBER: 5532237.  This item is utilized by all branches of the service to identify personnel locations at night and during the day; commonly used during rescue and recovery opera tions.  Personnel carry the signal in life vests and flight suit pockets.  It can also be located in life raft survival kits. This signal consists of an aluminum case approximately 5.376 inches long and 1.638 inches in diameter.  Each end is covered by a p rotective cap made of an EPDM elastomer.  The case has two raised beads around the circumference of the flare (night) end.  The beads help positively identify night end from day end by touch.  A label adhered to the outer surface of the case further identi fies the smoke (day) and the flare (night) ends and provides precise instructions for use.  The case contains four sub-assemblies:  smoke candle, smoke igniter, flare candle, and flare igniter.  The igniter is a one-hand operable device consisting of an ar ming lever that must be extended before functioning, and a mechanism that cocks and releases the firing pin (latch, lever, striker, and spring).  These parts are cadmium coated.  The lever is extended into the armed position and then depressed to cock and release the firing pin, the firing pin strikes a primer.  The primer then ignites a boron/potassium nitrate pellet on the smoke end or a red lead ignition composition on the flare end.  The BKNO3 pellet ignites Z-2 heat paper which ignites the smoke candle .  The red lead ignition composition ignites the flare candle.  Each candle emits a red display for approximately 20 seconds.  The harsh environment and life saving role of this signal dictate strict adherence to specifications to ensure reliable operation . MARINE SIGNAL, SMOKE AND ILLUM, MK124 MOD 1/LA60.  NSN: 1370-01-550-1355.  PART NUMBER: 8324647  This signal is identical in size and functional sequence to the Mk 124 Mod 0.  Each end of the Mk 124 Mod 1 is covered with polyethylene caps.  The smoke cap i s colored red and the flare cap is a translucent color with three spherical radius protrusions for added nighttime identification.  These caps are more rigid and snap into place over the igniter housing.  Another difference with the Mk 124 Mod 1 is chang e from cadmium coating to NiCoTef coating on the latch, lever, striker, and spring parts that make up the igniter mechanism.  These parts were identified as having excessive corrosion during fleet storage and use.  Extended salt spray/fog testing was perfo rmed on cadmium coated parts and NiCoTef coated parts.  The NiCoTef samples showed little to no evidence of corrosion.  The smoke ignition train has removed the BKNO3 pellet, Z-2 Heat Paper, and Red Lead ignition composition and replaced them with a simple  silicon/potassium nitrate ignition composition.  The flare candle ignition has also removed the red lead ignition composition and replaced it with the same silicon/potassium nitrate ignition composition.  These ignition compositions ignite directly from t he primer.  The smoke candle has also bee n reformulated eliminating toxic dyes such as Red 9 and Solvent Orange 7.  These dyes have been replaced with dyes approved by the FDA as safe for externally applied cosmetics and drugs.  This change reduces the toxicity to occupationally exposed personnel  during mixing, pressing, and assembly of signals. These items contains magnesium and oxidizers that are susceptible to ignition from static electricity.  Potential manufacturers of these components should be experienced in the handling and processing of said materials.   Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and av ailability.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities and identify the remaining capacity for simultaneous production of all the items listed above (and if m anufacturing resources are shared with other item/production lines).  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production.  A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technica l and manufacturing capability in the pyrotechnics industry.  A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (te chnical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent, must be able to demonstrate and should describe his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontra ctors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria.  The estimated annual production quantities are between 50,000 and 90,000 units as a combination of either the mod 0 or mod 1 configuration.  Interested companies should also include Rou gh Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit prices for each configuration for between 50,000 and 90,000 total units annually, as a conbination of either configuration, deliverable from FY08  FY12 on one consolidated contract. Interested parties have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item.  Any response to this market research should reference the following: Marine Sig nals - W52P1J-08-R-0009.  Please submit to: US Army Sustainment Command, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-M, Ms. Julie Coughlin, 1 Rock Island, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000, email:  julie.coughlin@us.army.mil.

Background/General Description of the Requirement

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) owns and operates a heavy water moderated nuclear test reactor and adjacent neutron beam research facility. The neutron beam facility is used to perform a broad array of state-of-the-art Biology, Materials, Chemistry, and Physics research. Some of the research performed at the NCNR is fundamental in nature, while other research is directly applicable to problems of immediate societal interest. Examples of recent NCNR research results can be found at the home page of the NCNR: www.ncnr.nist.gov. 

The NCNR?s reactor is licensed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the name National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). With respect to the NBSR as well as the neutron research facility, a large variety of engineering projects are being undertaken. These projects range from the design and planning of regularly scheduled maintenance of the NBSR to the design and planning of new and/or improved neutron beam research instrumentation.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $25 Mil for this acquisition. The RFP will be a 100 percent set-aside for small business and will therefore co ntain FAR clause 52.219-14 (must be met by the prime contractor, not collective small business team members). The follow-on acquisition will result in a single IDIQ award with fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line ite ms.

The solicitation identified as AG-435H-S-08-0001 is issued as a Request for Quotations using simplified acquisition procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and no written solicitation will be issued.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:   The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in Georgia has a requirement for stand examination services using FSVeg and ArcPad over approximately 9000 acres to both; (a) collect individual tree stand exam information and (b) delineate new stands due to changed conditions; primarily two southern pine beetle epidemics. Data collection would be required to be electronic using; (i) the Forest Service FSVeg software, (ii) a portable data recorder with integral GPS capability and (iii) running the ArcPad software.  Contractor would return electronic data of plot information and any ArcPad polygons for new stand delineations.  Work is expected to begin soon after award and must be completed by March 31, 2008 during the dormant season.   

Inventory will be done on about 9,000 acres within the Upper Piedmont physiographic area of the Forest at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The general area is National Forest south and east of US 441 in Banks, Stephens, and Habersham Counties, Georgia. Woods access is typically good on paved county or gravel Forest Service roads and terrain is moderate with approximately 1000 feet maximum relief. Areas to be examined are planned to be contiguous areas of hundreds to thousands of acres but a minor part of the total area may occur as scattered individual stands averaging about 25 acres each.   

Plot locations will be pre-determined by the Forest Service and marked as waypoints on electronic maps provided. Contractor will be responsible to navigate to these plots, collect GPS coordinates and tree data and mark the plot center. Plot intensity will vary by the condition of the stands being examined but is expected to average about one plot per five acres.  The type of plots will also vary but a variable radius 10 BAF prism plot sampling stems equal to or greater than 5 inches DBH would be most common.  

ESTIMATED PRICE RANGE:  $25,000 - $100,000

<DESC>Description 1.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation.  Please note that a solicitation for this effort does not exist and should not be requested.  A Pre-solicitation Synopsis will not be issued.	     2.  NASA/MSFC intends to place Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses for certain specialized engineering and project planning needs that may be necessary to support MSFC technical organizations, including, but not limited to, the Engineering Directorate, the Exploration Launch Office, Science and Missions Systems Office, and the Shuttle Propulsion Office. 3.  NASA/MSFC awarded 20 Specialized Engineering and Project Support (SEPS) BPAs in February 2006.	NASA/MSFC anticipates awarding an additional 3-5 SEPS BPAs with small businesses only, to complement the existing BPA awards.  The MSFC SEPS BPAs will be awarded off the GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES) Schedule 871 contract.  Accordingly, only those small businesses presently having a GSA contract under Schedule 871 will be considered for award.  The specific Schedule 871 Special Item Numbers (SINs) applicable to the MSFC SEPS BPAs, and any subsequent task orders issued under the BPAs, are provided in Paragraph 14 of this RFI.	   4.  Small businesses interested in being considered for an award of a MSFC SEPS BPA, and presently having a GSA Schedule 871 contract, are requested to submit their:  (1) core technical capabilities, (2) past performance, (3) GSA rate discount offer information, and (4) GSA contract number under Schedule 871, in accordance with the instructions in this RFI.      5.  NASA/MSFC will review the core capabilities, past performance and GSA rate discount offer information submitted by small businesses for award of 3-5 BPAs in one of the three (3) existing BPA categories:    I.  Highly specialized, or niche, engineering skills for concept definition and analysis (special studies) for emerging exploration tasks.      II.  Specialized engineering, development, and manufacturing to support one of a kind engineering test fixtures, test articles, and models.	     III.  Specialized Program/Project Planning, Analyses, and Support  Small businesses awarded a BPA will be placed in one of the three above BPA categories based upon an assessment of their core capabilities.  Small businesses awarded a BPA will be placed in one of the three above BPA categories based upon an assessment of their core capabilities.  6.  NASA/MSFC is requesting interested small businesses to submit statements of their core capabilities, preferably from existing company documentation and/or brochures to the greatest extent possible.  NASA/MSFC intends to review core capabilities and award BPAs to those small businesses that:  (1) have core capabilities that are best aligned with NASA/MSFC future technical needs as they are now anticipated by MSFC technical organizations, (2) provide past performance information that well supports or demonstrates the small businesses core capabilities, and (3) are willing to provide discounts from the GSA contract rates.	Technical capability submissions should include information on contractor locations for the specialized support. 7.  NASA/MSFC intends to place the SEPS BPAs with a zero dollar ($0) Government-minimum order quantity.  NASA/MSFC is under no obligation to award any task orders against any of the SEPS BPAs.  8.  NASA/MSFC will manage the use of the SEPS BPAs in consideration of the potential overlap with the current Engineering, Science and Technical Services Contract (ESTS) and other existing Center-wide contracts.  The current ESTS prime contractor and its teammates will not be considered for an award of a SEPS BPA.  9.  NASA/MSFC intends to initially award only 3-5 BPAs as a result of the responses received to this RFI.  However, NASA/MSFC reserves the right to award additional BPAs in the future from the responses received to this RFI. 10.  The Contractor shall specify if they are considered a small business under the GSA Schedule 871 for Professional Engineering Services.  Contractors, as applicable, may be required to sign non-disclosure statements for certain requirements that may be authorized under the SEPS BPAs.      11.  Contractors must limit core capability submissions to three (3) pages, front only, font size 12.  Attached is the Past Performance Questionnaire to be completed with relevant past performance for a maximum of three (3) contracts (past performance forms are not included in the three page limit on capability submissions).	    12.
