<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate (AFRL/SNA) is issuing a single step (full initial proposal), 6 year, open-ended Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the Advanced Technologies for the Software Protection Initiative program (ATSPI). Multiple contract awards and/or assistance instruments are anticipated with an estimated value of $2.0M or less with typical periods of performance of 6-24 months including final report.   (1)  RESEARCH NEED:  ATSPI seeks to identify and promote research topics that provide software protection technologies for the OSD Software Protection Initiative (SPI).  The overall objective of the ATSPI BAA is to identify, study, research and develop the key technologies needed to strengthen current software protection capabilities for scientific, engineering, and modeling/simulation software that executes on general-purpose computers spanning HPC clusters to advanced desktop machines.  The anticipated ATSPI Focused Research Topics (FRTs) support the SPI program and include the following research areas:  1) Protection Against Unauthorized Use/Theft/Piracy where this research involves such areas as hardware/software node-locking and other means to protect application software on general purpose computers;  2)  Protection Against Reverse Engineering where this research involves areas such as disassemblers, decompilers, obfuscation techniques, binary editors, and debuggers;  3)  Secure Distribution and Tracking Methods where this research involves areas such as distribution management/accountability, encryption, and watermarking;  4)  Secure Application Development Tools where this research involves areas such as virtual machines, special encryption methods, specialized computer hardware, special editors, software pedigree development/management, and tools/methodologies for security of object/component based elements of software applications;  5)  Software Benchmarks, Measures of Effectiveness, and Measures of Performance where this research involves areas such  as the definition, development, and evaluation of science-based software protection metrics, the development of software applications for use in benchmarking protection techniques, and the development of software protection technology tools and theory.  (2) BACKGROUND: Historically, the ability to effectively exploit high performance computing depends upon the availability of high performance computer systems and application software that can execute on these systems.  The combination of these two technologies has enabled advances in defense science and technology and has provided the computational capability that is a key component of maintaining US national security.  Because of the perceived national value of HPC assets, these assets have been protected almost from their very inception.  Traditionally, the strategy employed to maintain the US lead in the HPC arena has consisted of two parts: (1) research and development to insure the maintenance of superior technology and (2) export controls to restrict access by potential adversaries to these assets.  Recently, rapid advances in computer hardware technology (e.g. Linux clusters) have rendered export controls on high performance computer systems ineffective.  At this time, there is no reason to believe that this trend is reversible and there are many reasons to believe that it will instead worsen with time.  Concomitantly, there has been an increasing realization that the software (executing on these high performance computers) is the crucial intellectual property that must be protected.  The wide spread availability of computer clustering technology in conjunction with the realization that DoD software has a tremendous intellectual value mandates stronger protection of application software. This insures continued US superiority in research and development of advanced weapon systems along with superiority in the generation of scientific and technical intelligence.  In December 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Science and Technology) to establish the Software Protection Initiative (SPI) to improve the protection of critical national security application software.  The SPI goals are to slow the acquisition of DoD application software by adversaries, make cost-prohibitive the exploitation of DoD software when it does leak, and insure technology/policy protection measures are appropriately applied balancing mission requirements and software security.  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Science and Technology) appointed the Air Force Research Laboratory as the Office of Primary Responsibility for management and execution of the DoD Software Protection Initiative.  The Advanced Technologies for the Software Protection Initiative (ATSPI) identifies, investigates, develops, evolves, and matures the R&D software protection technology base for the SPI.  This initial BAA solicits research proposals in Focused Research Topics (FRT)  #1, #2, #3 and #4 only (see http://www.eps.gov/).  (3) Proposal Information:  Proposal instructions are contained in the solicitation and specific FRT on the EPS homepage (http://www/eps.gov/).  Proposals for these four topic areas are due on  15 July 2002, 4:00 PM, local time.  Periodically over the 6 year period (ending  31 May 08), amendments to the BAA/solicitation will be issued in the CBD to request proposals for subsequent Focused Research Topics (FRT).  Proposals for subsequent Focused Research Topics (FRT) will be due 30 days after issuance of the BAA amendment in the CBD.  This BAA is being conducted under full and open competitive procedures.  However source restrictions, such as no foreign participation due to International Tariff Arms Regulations (ITAR), may apply and will be addressed on an FRT by FRT basis with specific instructions within each FRT.  One or more Inter-Government Personnel Act (IPA) employees will perform the evaluations and will be used during the evaluation process.  IPA employees are subject to the Conflict of Interest Laws and Standards of Conduct provisions, such as rules on disclosure of confidential information. The Government may employ non-government personnel as technical advisors or to provide administrative support under this solicitation.  Currently, the Government plans to use Riverside Research Inc. and MITRE, Inc. to provide administrative support.  These individuals and the firms that employ them have signed non-disclosure statements and will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.  PRIOR TO AWARD OF ANY CONTRACT, POTENTIAL OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED WITH THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) (http://www.ccr2000.com/) AND BE ABLE TO RECEIVE PAYMENT VIA ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT).  Potential offerors must also have a DUNS Number (http://www.ccr.gov/faqs.html#10).  It is anticipated awards may be either firm fixed price or cost-reimbursable type with cost-reimbursable type being the preferred method.  Prior to award of a cost-reimbursable type contract, the offeror must have an adequate accounting system for determining costs IAW FAR 16.301-3.   (4)  Points of Contact: Interested offerors may submit questions to AFRL TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: Jeff Hughes (AFRL/SNAS) or Dr. Martin R. Stytz (AFRL/SNZW), email: atspi@wpafb.af.mil or CONTRACTING POINT OF CONTACT:  Mr. David L. Shellabarger (AFRL/SNKD), (937) 255-4863.

In each country, the evaluation shall analyze available resources and program achievements in terms of prevention of blindness activities and products/services, as well as program outcomes in terms of blindness status, coverage of services, quality of services, and patient satisfaction.  Task 2:  To assess the magnitude and type of refractory anomalies in children in different ethnic/cultural settings; to make operational the correction of refractory anomalies in school children, considering resources commonly found in respective country health services; and to conduct further specialized analyses of refractive error utilizing data obtained from the previous Refractive Error Studies in Children (RESC).  RESC surveys will be conducted in three different regions, to complement those already completed.  The following regions should be considered:  Eastern Europe; South-East Asia; Western Pacific. In each study site, the already developed and approved RESC protocol(as published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology) will be utilized.  Consideration shall also be given to developing eye-care strategies so that refractive error and associated visual impairment could be corrected in a cost-effective manner.  It is important that locally available health personnel become involved in the identification of refractory anomalies in need of correction and provide access to affordable spectacles.

A visual depiction of the Kit, together with other parts of the technical data package and solicitation documents can be viewed through the FreeMarkets Webpage (http://www.freemarkets.com) after registration, and possible download and installation of viewing software.  Additionally, if available, the Microsoft PowerPoint can be viewed among the published documents at http://www.fedbizOpps.gov.  (See Attachment-D to the solicitation, Overview (PowerPoint Presentation)).  The award of a contract as a result of this solicitation is a two-part process.  The Postal Service is establishing a Qualified Suppliers List for performance described in the solicitation documents.   Once the Qualified Suppliers list is established, those suppliers whose names appear on the list will be invited to compete in a Reverse Auction for the requirement.  Please see solicitation Attachment-F Competitive Bidding Event Information.  The Postal Service intends to award a one firm fixed price contract for the total quantity to the pre-qualified supplier who offers the best value to the Postal Service, considering the evaluated technical proposal submitted in accordance with the solicitation requirements, and the bid price. In order to be favorably considered for the Pre-Qualified Suppliers List for the requirement, the offeror must submit an offer in accordance with the solicitation requirements. No award is intended in response to the solicitation except that those offerors who submit offers that are evaluated, based upon the solicitation evaluation criteria, and are placed on the Postal Service Qualified Supplier?s List for the requirement will be invited to compete in a reverse auction from which a best value determination will be made considering the results of both the pricing and the results of the technical evaluation. Once established, the Pre-Qualified Suppliers List for the requirement may be the source of potential offerors for future purchases of the same or similar items.  The list will be maintained for a minim of one-year from date of award. In the development of technical proposals, the offeror must follow the format and the numbering system as set forth in the AFCS-VF Kit Statement of Work, and number responses to the requirements identically to the SOW (including Attachments B &C) and address each paragraph in the indicated numerical order.  Additionally, the offeror must include with its proposal a breakdown of the elements that comprise its total price in a fashion consistent with Attachment-G of the solicitation.
Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether it complies with the specifications within the statement of work and the other requirements of the solicitation documents.  To be favorable considered, proposals must demonstrate the methods, means, resources, and sequence the offeror will use in satisfying the specifications and requirement of the solicitation. The Postal Service will provide those who represent a good faith intent to compete for the award of the contract an opportunity to view a prototype Advanced Facer Canceler Video Facer (AFCS-VF) Modification Kit as indicated in the solicitation, and ask to questions. Offers, complete with technical and pricing proposals, are due by the date and at the time and place indicated on the cover page to the solicitation (PS Form 8203).  Additionally, offerors must on or before 12 June 2002 submit a statement of intent to submit an offer by sending a e-mail to: rbatts@email.usps.gov and kcox2@email.usps.gov.  The statement should simply state the following (or similar language).  (I believe my company will be favorably considered under the solicitation evaluation criteria and is capable of delivering the requirement as described in the solicitation documents.  We intend to respond with an offer in accordance with the solicitation requirements.)  Under FreeMarkets? Competitive Bidding Procedures, the price offered in response to the solicitation for evaluation for consideration for the Qualified Offers List will be considered the offerors ceiling price at the time of the auction event.  Questions, comments, requests for clarification or more information, etc., must be submitted vial e-mail to: rbatts@email.usps.gov and kcox2@email.usps.gov.

<DESC>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Statistics Canada?s generalized automated coding software: ACTR (?Automated Coding by Text Recognition?) uses a data-driven approach to the assignment of standard codes from text.  ACTR includes tools for maintaining a database of textual entries known to correlate strongly with a particular code.  Because it performs coding based on text retrieval, ACTR is independent of the coding strategy and language in use.  ACTR may be used in batch mode to perform unattended coding of well-defined cases, and in interactive mode for the coding of ?problem? cases.

ACTR will be used for a CE production system at the Census Bureau.  

FEATURES

IDENTIFY SOURCES OF CODE AND TEXT CORRELATION:

To use ACTR, a coding database must first be created.  This is entirely under the control of the user, which allows ACTR to be easily custom tailored to your application.  Sources of text and code correlation vary, but popular sources include captured text from previous surveys as well as coding reference manuals.  Regardless of what source is used to create the database, ACTR allows updates at any time.  As a result the longer ACTR is used in a survey, the greater the coding success rate becomes.

CREATE CODING DATABASE:

ACTR provides a complete set of tools for both batch and interactive creation and updating of coding databases.  These tools readily allow for ?What if? analysis to be performed while still in the process of defining a coding strategy.

MODIFY PARSING STRATEGY?

At the centre of ACTR?s text retrieval capabilities is a text parsing process which is highly user directed.  Users have control over such considerations as character mappings, trivial words, prefixes, suffixes, etc.  The system also allows users to control the order of the parsing process.

<DESC>CMc Pre-Solicitation Notice Announcement

The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the proposed new U. S. Courthouse located in Nashville, Tennessee. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. A Fixed-Price Incentive (Successive Targets) with an Award Fee contract under FAR 16.403-2 is contemplated. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).  Project Summary. The project consists of design and construction of a building approximately 30,192 gross square meters (324,982 gross square feet) without parking, and approximately 36,510 gross square meters (392,982 gross square feet) including 170 interior parking spaces. The proposed courthouse will provide a total of ten (10) courtrooms, seven (7) district and three (3) magistrate courtrooms. The building will house the District and Magistrate Courts, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, the Circuit Satellite Library, U.S. Probation, U.S. Pretrial Service, and GSA. The proposed facility will be constructed in Nashville, Tennessee with the exact site to be determined. Estimated combined (pre-construction and optional construction phase) project cost range is $70,000,000 to $80,000,000. The facility will be designed in metric units.
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.
Services to be Provided. The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel as needed to perform all required services including, but not limited to, those described in this pre-solicitation notice.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  
Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.

Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, construction of the building, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.

The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility

<DESC>NA PEO IEW&S, PM NVRISTA, Fort Belvoir, VA is issuing a 12 month Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for potential solutions to the requirement of a lightweight target location device for the light forces using modifications to curre nt products to the maximum extent possible for a planned production start in the FY04/FY05 timeframe. No currently available system meets all requirements for a Dismounted Optic Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Projected Army requirements are for u p to 1200 systems.  A single dismounted soldier will operate the Dismounted Optic.  The device determines range, azimuth, and vertical angle to a target during both day and night operations.  A stand-alone global positioning system (GPS) device will provid e self-location data.  The Dismounted Optic combines targeting data with GPS device information to determine complete, and automated, targeting data for fire requests.  This data will then be used to call for and adjust fire with limited keystrokes on both  the Dismounted Optic and hand-held digital devices.  During power loss, the device will continue to function as standard binoculars.  The mission of the Dismounted Optic is to provide accurate targeting data to provide effective fires with artillery and m ortars. The Contracting Officer is Mr. Arnold Rappaport, U.S. Army CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-AC-CC-RT-L (RAP), Bldg. 1208 West, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008; 732.532.3428, E-mail: Arnold.Rappaport@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

All parties interested in doing business with CECOM are invited to access, operate and send and receive information from the Interactive Business Opportunity Page at http://abop.monmouth.army.mil. Upon accessing this webpage, click on CECOM Business Opportunities; you may access potential CECOM Business Opportunities by registering for a use r ID and password. All proposal submissions for this planned solicitation will be through the IBOP. The BAA will be found by accessing the Army Contracting Activity drop down menu, selecting CECOM and then searching for DAAB07-02-R-L241, once it is posted.  The Offeror shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the technical requirements and shall demonstrate the ability to meet the Dismounted Optic performance specification, cost objectives and schedule requirements in order to be considered for award. The proposals will be evaluated to determine if the technical information and analysis are adequate to support an offerors proposed work effort and technical approach.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility plans to procure GeneChip probe arrays, GeneArray Scanners, Fluidics Stations, Hybridization Ovens, and  supporting software packages, service and technical support from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  The NCI has as one of its missions the goal of manufacturing quality cDNA microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, provide training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences. These high density DNA micro-arrays (arrays) will be and have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, rat, yeast, and other organisms.  Affymetrix Inc., was the successful offeror under a small business set aside competitive solicitation in June 1999 and have provided NCI probe arrays in the areas of human, mouse, rat, yeast gene analysis and custom probe arrays.  They have also provided NCI with approximately 7 GeneArray Scanners, Fluidics Stations,  and miscellaneous related equipment.  Under this new procurement, Affymetrix will provide DNA micro-arrays containing at least 10,000 different  target sequences per square centimeter of solid support substrate and the sequences will be represented as 25-mer oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a glass support using light directed solid phase combinatorial chemistry. Arrays will utilize approximately 10-20 paired oligonucleotide probes per gene for analysis. Arrays will contain sequences from UniGene, GenBank, Saccharomyces Genome Database, TIGR databases or other databases currently available. The arrays must be sensitive enough to detect mRNA transcripts at the rate of 2-3 copies per cell.  Arrays will also be sensitive enough to identify mRNA concentration level changes 2-3 fold and greater for high sensitivity expression comparison.  The NCI has a significant experimental investment in this technology and it is essential that to maintain the integrity of ongoing experiments by not introducing new variables into ongoing protocols.  The equipment and arrays are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Affymetrix, Inc is the only organization known that has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the arrays provided will be compatible with the existing equipment and/or that the equipment provided will be compatible with the arrays being used.   The statement and any other supporting information must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meet the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June  6, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>Synopsis for Fed Biz Ops Tower Construction Kit.  In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS) to acquire a tower construction kit to reconstitute a NEXRAD radar site from Valmont-Microflect, 3575 25th Street, SE, Salem, OR  97302-1123.  The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) has management responsibility for the tri-agency network of NEXRAD radars located throughout the United States and at select overseas locations.  The NEXRAD program currently has no replacement tower parts in its inventory to support reconstitution of a damaged or destroyed radar tower.  The purpose of this procurement action is to acquire the tower components necessary to completely and expeditiously reconstitute an entire 30-meter tower or any portion thereof destroyed by an unforeseeable catastrophic event.  Component materials are defined as all parts, fasteners, ladders, platforms, wave guide bridges, decking, radome rings, stairs, and major and minor components necessary to assemble one complete tower in any configuration from 5 meters to 30 meters or restore specific subsections thereof.  This requirement qualifies as a sole source because the government does not own any of the necessary manufacturing data associated with the WSR-88D Tower.  This limits the government's ability to adequately specify the design of compatible components to another contractor.  Valmont-Microflect, the original equipment manufacturer, is the only source that possesses the necessary technical information to meet the requirements for specification compatibility and structural integrity for integration of materials into the existing NEXRAD tower configurations currently in the tower network. This acquisition is for a commercial item.  Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet.  This is not a formal solicitation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Laboratory of Neurophysiology(LNP), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(NINDS) intends on entering into a sole source contract with Atto Biosciences Inc., 15010 Broschart Road, Rockville, MD 20850 for an Upgraded Attofluor Digital Ratiovision System with additional accessories.  The Laboratory of Neurophysiology conducts research in the fields of Neurophysiology and Developmental Neurobiology, and has developed a novel FACS-based strategy to identify and isolate cells composing the mammalian central nervous system(CNS) including the human CNS during the formation of the tissue.  The FACS sorting strategy permits for the first time direct experimental access to neural stem cells, which exhibit both self-renewing and multi potential differentiation properties, and to neuronal and glial progenitors, which have begun to differentiate.  The purchase of an up-graded system will facilitate experiments and further improve the spatio-temporal resolution as well as allow the LNP to fully explore and understand biomedical issues as physiological regulation and developmental changes in embryonic CNS.  The Upgraded Attofluor Digital Ratiovision System is the only system known to the Government that will allow the LNP to facilitate investigations into the physiological basis for neural stem cell differentiation into neuronal and glial phenotypes.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 PM EST on June 10, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. The NAICS Code 334513 and the business size standard is 500 employees

Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Morocco:  Bou Regreg Ozonation Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a feasibility study for a proposed ozonation facility for the Bou Regreg River in Morocco.

The Office National de l?Eau Potable (ONEP) is responsible for producing potable water nationwide.  In addition, ONEP distributes water in small towns and rural areas.  In cities, water is generally distributed by water utilities under the purview of the Ministry of Interior.  Concessions have been granted for the water distribution of Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangiers to foreign companies.  The same utilities are responsible for wastewater management (collection and treatment) in cities.  In small towns, wastewater management is done by the Communes or by ONEP.  Wastewater collection systems in rural areas are virtually nonexistent. 

An important ONEP mission, given Morocco?s constrained water resource situation, is to identify reasonable alternatives to traditional water treatment and supply approaches.  For instance, ONEP wants to acquire ozonation technologies, as well as new water oxidation and disinfecting techniques.  The agency has been predominantly using chlorine as a disinfectant, but the quality of raw water in many areas cannot be effectively treated with chlorine alone.  ONEP is also looking for appropriate technologies to remove nitrates from groundwater.  Specifically, ONEP would like to remove nitrates in the El Garaa aquifer, which is located in the Ben Slimane area (between Rabat and Casablanca), also in close proximity to the proposed Bou Regreg facility.  

Bou Regreg water is generally of good quality, but it contains sediments with high concentrations of iron and manganese, which make it harder to treat and affect the water?s taste and smell qualities.  An increase in the region?s population has made it necessary for the expansion of the existing water treatment plant, which would replace chlorination by ozonation of raw water followed by filtration on activated coal grains.  The purpose of this feasibility study is to assess whether the chlorination system used to treat water from the Bou Regreg River should be upgraded with ozonation technology followed by activated carbon filtration.  The feasibility study will complement previous studies conducted by the Office National de l?Eau Potable (ONEP) and will constitute an opportunity to introduce American technologies in Morocco.  The tasks for the study are summarized as follows:  Task 1.1) critical analysis of the results of an earlier study conducted by ONEP on the Bou Regreg ozonation facility; Task 1.2) options analysis for the implementation of a water treatment ozonation facility; Task 1.3) technical/economic analysis of options and environmental impact assessment; Task 2.1) preparation of project design specifications; Task 2.2) preparation of an implementation plan; Task 2.3) preparation of a finance strategy; and Task 2.4) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.

<DESC>The GSA/FTS, Region 5 is announcing its intent to issue a contract, as a fixed price award, for Developing and Pilot Testing Community Assessment Surveys, in support of AMC/DPFF located at Scott Air Force Base, IL  62225.  The United States Air Force has long recognized the strong link between quality-of-life, particularly family and community support, and readiness and retention of Air Force personnel and provided broad-based programs and services in support of these outcomes.  Historically, key Air Force human service agencies have utilized the Community Needs Assessment (CNA) to plan, resource and guide programming on behalf of Air Force members, their families and communities.   CNAs were fielded between 1993 and 2000.  With the emergence of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System (IDS), which provides a mechanism for collaboration across all AF human service agencies to deliver services, increasingly focus has shifted from an assessment of needs to the assessment of results achieved within the community.  Currently, installation IDS teams across the AF are being trained to deliver and monitor services using the Community Capacity and Results Management models.  Significant modifications in the structure of the CNA, began in 1999/00, are required to provide the community results data that inform planning, programming and resourcing of human service efforts consistent with these frameworks.   The Air Force IDS Working Group hosted a Community Assessment Planning / Decision Meeting in San Antonio, Texas, 17-19 December 2001, with the purpose of making key decisions regarding the 2002 version of the Community Assessment.  This meeting identified key domain areas for the 2002 Community Assessment and specified timelines for the implementation of the survey.  The critical initial tasks are the development of the draft Community Assessment Survey and the pilot testing of this instrument.  Four major deliverables shall be required during the performance of this requirement: (1) a draft 2002 AF Community Assessment Survey for active duty members, (2) formatted copies of draft survey for pilot testing, (3) a summary report of pilot test results, and, (4) a final draft of the active duty community assessment survey. The proposed project is divided into two distinct tasks.  Any necessary travel by contractor personnel will be the responsibility of the contractor.  Invitational Travel Orders will be issued to allow contractors to utilize on base lodging on a space-available basis.  This effort shall be divided into two distinct tasks.  Task 1:  Develop AF Community Assessment Survey for Active Duty Members.  This task includes developing items and scales for inclusion in the 2002 AF Community Assessment survey.  These items and scales shall be designed to assess key concepts in the U.S. Air Force Community Capacity Model.  Based on feedback from AF leadership, contractor shall make necessary revisions to the proposed items and scales and resubmit them for AF review.  Deliverables under this task include:  (1) a draft 2002 AF Community Assessment Survey for active duty members, and (2) formatted copies of draft survey for pilot testing;  Task 2:  Pilot Test AF Community Assessment Surveys for Active Duty Members.  Contractor shall visit two AMC AF bases for a period of two and one half days to pilot test the community assessment survey.  Four groups of approximately 25 active duty members (total = 100) will complete the survey in focus group settings.  Completion times shall be recorded for each respondent.  Focus group members will participate in a one-hour, structured discussion about the strengths and limitations of the survey instrument, including a review of item and response formats.  In addition to meeting with groups of active duty members, two consultants shall meet with the IDS at each base to review the survey.  These meetings shall be scheduled in a group setting for a period of two and one-half hours.  The AF will appoint a point of contact (POC) at each base who will assume responsibility for recruiting active duty members for participation for handling the necessary logistics of the visits.  Diversity will be an important objective in the recruitment of survey respondents.  Deliverables for this task shall be; (1) a summary report of pilot test results, and (2) a final draft of the active duty community assessment survey. Delivery and acceptance of all items shall be F.O.B. Destination. The period of performance for both tasks is the date of award through 30 September 2002.  All data and products resulting from this award shall become the property of the Government with unlimited rights.  Contract award and administrative action will be processed through GSA?s Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Copies of all invoices shall be submitted in to the Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS) for client acceptance. The contractor shall use the acceptance information document to submit details of the goods and /or services rendered or delivery dates, and the amounts to be billed to the clients. Once the contractor submits the Acceptance Information document, the GSA client may accept, reject, or partially accept the goods and or services. The client also indicates the amount approved for payment. By logging in to ITSS at this URL, the contractor may access the acceptance information field: http://it-solutions.gsa.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a highly qualified general construction contractor and specialized subcontractors for the IIA23008 COURTHOUSE RENOVATION at the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse at 131 East 4th Street in Davenport, Iowa.  Scope of work will encompass selective demolition, construction of an addition, underground parking, and associated structural modifications, and renovation of the entire building, including but not limited to new courtrooms, chambers and associated suites, new prisoner detention areas, and new office space throughout. Exterior sidewalks, plantings, and hardscaping will be replaced. Required systems upgrades will include HVAC, plumbing, and sprinklers, and electrical distribution.  The approximately 75,000 gross square feet building was constructed in 1932, and historic preservation will be required in portions of the building, with an emphasis on decorative metal and wood recreation and restoration.  The building has a structural steel frame with concrete floor slabs, and is clad in travertine limestone with a base of polished granite. The bid will be broken into options and separate prices. The building will be vacant during construction, with the exception of a construction management office.  Bonds will be required from the successful contractor for the full amount of the construction contract.  The project will be in conformance with all applicable building codes, life safety requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Quality material and design, low maintenance, energy efficiency, recycling, construction waste management, and sustainable design issues as defined by the LEEDS (Leadership in Energy and Design) rating system of the U.S. Green Buildings Council, are elements of the project, and the project goal is a Silver LEEDS rating.  The project will include an Art-In-Architecture component, to be procured separately by the Government. Estimated cost range:  $8,000,000 to $12,000,000.  Completion time:  540 calendar days (approx 18 months) after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about January 8, 2003.  This contract is restricted to those firms having an existing general construction contracting office within the five-state area of Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement, elevator work, and roof work shall satisfy special competencies as detailed in the specification. Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One will be technical evaluation of the prime construction contractor.  Stage Two will be technical evaluation of the subcontractors and team composition, management and technical approach of the general contractor, sustainable design approach, and pricing.  The Government intends to use the ?greatest value concept? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?greatest value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP), contains a general scope of work, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  This RFTP will be issued on or about June 14, 2002.  All requests for RFTPs must be in writing.  There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on June 21, 2002 from 10:30 am -12:30 pm, at the project site in Davenport.  Proposals will be received in this office on or about July 16, 2002.  Specific date and time will be specified in the RFTP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  There will be a short-list of technically qualified contractors published at the FedBizOpps.gov web site on or about August 20, 2002.  Offerors should submit Stage Two technical and price proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate Stage One submissions to establish those within a competitive range.  Per FAR clause 15.306 (c) 2, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Technical Qualifications, Pricing, the subcontracting plan and special competency requirements.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the Stage One technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Prime Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Team and Locality Experience. The elements that make up the Stage Two technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are Experience and Past Performance of Specialty Subcontractors, Balance of Team Composition, Management and Technical Approach, and Sustainable Design Plan.  Stage Two evaluations will also include price.  The price factor is not initially as important as the technical evaluation factor.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The Bid Documents will be made available to the offerors selected to participate in Stage Two.  Printed sets and drawings on CD produced in AutoCAD may be purchased directly from a printer to be determined.  Cost of prints and CD will be non-refundable and shall be paid directly to the printer.  Contact Georgann Butler, Contracting Officer, in writing at georgann.butler@gsa.gov to request the Stage One RFTP and for questions concerning this announcement (phone 816-823-4918) or fax at 816-926-3571.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Denise Ryerkerk, in writing at denise.ryerkerk@gsa.gov (phone 816-823-2269).  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources may submit technical qualifications for Stage One, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Offers from Small Disadvantaged business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.12.  FAR Clause 52.219-23 ? Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns shall apply.

<CONTACT>Troy Teachey, (202)267-7386
<DESC>On May 1, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced its intention to award a bridge contract to Titan Systems Corporation.  The period of performance of this bridge is such that it will allow the FAA the time necessary to conduct an adequate competition.  In August 2002 the FAA intends to post (in electronic format only) a Screening Information Request requesting offers for the provision of technical support services to assist the Navigation Integrated Product Team (IPT) in the planning, engineering, development, acquisition, implementation, and sustainment of various navigation, landing and lighting systems.  It is the FAAs expectation that such support will be procured for a base period of three years with two two year options. <P> At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the FAAs Acquisition Management System (AMS) this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. <P> In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: <P> 1.	Capability Statement  This document should identify past performance references for the last 3 years for work performed of a similar type. (Limited to 5 pages) 2.	Resumes  These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in a future proposal to a request for proposals. 3.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 4.	If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 5.	Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. 6.	If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. <P> Attached is the present working copy of the Statement of Work for the existing contract with Titan Systems Corporation.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the follow-on procurement.  Additional work will be required in the new procurement, but it will not be significantly different from the previous requirements.  Also attached is an estimated level of effort by year for the impending contract.  These documents are being provided to give interested vendors a better understanding of the requirements of this procurement.  The major North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these efforts is 541330. <P> This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. <P> A vendors failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendors exclusion from the competition. <P> However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a), socially economically disadvantaged, or other small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition.   Please submit your response to this market survey by July 1, 2002.  Responses shall be sent to Troy Teachey, Contracting Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, ASU-310, 800 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20591. <P>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Rosher Gilbert, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 874-3145, Fax (202) 874-3135, Email rosher.gilbert@bep.treas.gov - Jennifer Sellers, Contracting Officer/Manager, Phone (202) 874-3148, Fax (202) 874-3135, Email jennifer.sellers@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is providing this AMENDMENT to the former Announcement RFQ29-2PB8PJ (which closed on March 21, 2002), to incorporate questions and answers to the technical specifications for the turnkey installation of a state-of-the art, Computerized Numerical Control (CNC), LASER MARKING SYSTEM (LMS) used for part number serialization of metal printing dies, as was specified in the initial announcement.  OFFERORS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED THEIR QUOTATIONS MAY SUBMIT A REVISED QUOTATION BASED ON BOTH THIS AMENDMENT AND THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.    --QUESTION 1:  Parts may be fed into the LMS as single units or lots of 36 pieces.  Is this 36 of any part configuration including rectangular, circular and cylindrical?  -- ANSWER 1:  Yes.  --QUESTION 2:  Should the system be able to support and automatically transport 36 each, 8 inch x 10 inch x 4 inch steel plates weighing hundreds of pounds? --ANSWER 2:  A lot of 36 pieces will be at the smallest end of the size range; 1.5 inches long (38.1mm) by .05 inches wide (12.7mm) by 0.150 inches thick (3.81mm).  --QUESTION 3:  LMS shall be capable of marking parts on convex, concave and irregular surfaces.  Laser marking systems can only mark on a flat surface.  To mark irregular or convex/concave surface, the part and/or the laser marking head must be moved to track the surface.  To cover any and all possibilities, this will be a very expensive 5-axis motion system.  What are the dimensions of the irregularities and curvature dimensions of concave/convex parts?   --ANSWER 3:  The Bureau is interested in purchasing a LASER marker that has the capability of marking parts of various geometries.  The minimum part radius of curvature is 0.5 inches for concave and convex surfaces.  The equipment should be a commercially available design.  The Bureau does not expect that the items to be marked will need to be rotated by the system.     --QUESTION 4:  The laser marked depth of the alphanumeric characters shall range from 0.003 inches to 0.100 inches.  This is not possible at a specified character height of 0.100 inches.  Printing dies are normally not laser engraved deeper than 0.010 inches.  Was this a typo?  --ANSWER 4:  No.  As stated in the specification, the laser marked depth of the alphanumeric characters shall range from 0.003 inches to 0.100 inches.  The specification also states, that the LMS shall be capable of producing alphanumeric characters 0.100 inches high (2.54mm) by 0.050 inches wide (1.27mm) for unique sequential serial numbers.  These two statements are separate requirements and were not intended to imply that a laser marker must at least be able to mark all stated font sizes and at all stated depths.  The Bureau has need for a LASER Marker that can burn to a range of depths and that is capable of producing alphanumeric characters of various commercially available fonts.  The Bureau is not interested in a LASER Marker that is capable of marking to only one specific depth or producing only one type of font. --QUESTION 5:  ...capable of marking...at a rate of 70 parts per hour.  This is probably not possible at a depth of 0.100 inches.  This is very possible at the shallower depths.  --ANSWER 5:  We agree.  Our specification did not intend to imply that the rate of marking of 70 parts per hour applied to the full range of depths sited in the specification.  Offerors should provide information on what size font and/or depth their equipment is capable of marking at 70 parts per hour.  --QUESTION 6:  It would be very helpful to understand the end-users concept of what they are looking for in terms of specific part handling and fixture and to understand more about the steps of the parts that are not flat.  As the RFQ is written, hundreds of thousands of dollars can be spent to address these undefined, irregular surfaces.  Do they envision an operator manually loading parts into the system, perhaps loading a magazine of parts into the system for batch marking, perhaps a rotary chuck for marking around cylinders?  Is this what they meant by round or is the round part still a flat marking surface?  Does it really require a five-axis system to mark any possible surface irregularity and convex/concave shapes with significant variations in the height of the marking surface?  Please respond to the above and we will try to conceptualize a cost-effective solution for you.  -- ANSWER 6:  The proposed equipment shall be capable of being tooled to accept parts currently manufactured from hardened tool steel.  These parts range in size from 1.5 inches long [38.1mm] by 0.5 inches wide [12.7mm} by 0.150 inches thick [3.81mm] to 10 inches long [254mm] by 8 inches wide [203.2mm] by 4 inches thick [101.6mm].  The parts may be manually loaded into the LASER Marking System as single units or lots of 36 pieces.  Since the Bureau utilizes parts of various sizes and shapes, which are not specifically defined, manual loading of parts as single units or lots of 36 pieces is all that is required.  --QUESTION 7:  Part geometries may vary from circular segments to rectangular prisms within the sizes listed and may require fixtures to hold the parts.  BEP will provide the Fixtures?  Please clarify.  --ANSWER 7:  Yes, BEP will provide the fixtures.  -- OUESTION 8:  Parts may be fed into the LMS as single units or lots of 36 pieces  Please clarify.  -- ANSWER 8:  Parts will be manually placed on the fixture and then manually loaded into the LMS.  --QUESTION 9:  Portability of the various software packages is required.  Please clarify, portable software?  --ANSWER 9:  Software that can be transported from one computer to another.  Quotations are due on June 07, 2002.  QUOTATIONS SHALL CONTAIN ALL OF THE REQUIRED INFORMATION STATED IN BOTH THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT AND THIS AMENDMENT AND SHALL BE SIGNED, SIGNED AND SUBMITTED BY FAX, BY FAX ONLY, to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), Office of Procurement, Materials & IT Division, Attention Ms. Rosher Gilbert at (202) 874-3135.  All quotations are due on Friday, June 07, 2002.

<DESC>Questions and Answers                 1.	What is the fluid that will be used in this valve? The fluid is ambient hydrogen. 2.	What is the piping material connected to the valve? The mating hubs on the pipe connected to the valve are Nitronic 40 (per ASTM A182 FXM-11). 3.	What is a "D25" ending? Is this a Reflange or Graylock number? A "D" hub is a heavy-duty hub for severe service. It is physically larger than a normal hub and requires "D" size clamps. A "D25" is a "D" hub with a 25 seal ring size. These hubs are in the Grayloc catalog. 4.	What type of seat shut-off is required? The seat material and/or any other soft goods used must be compatible with gaseous hydrogen. Since, this valve is used for bottle isolation, there should be zero seat or external leakage at the rated pressure of 15000 psi. 5.	What are the O.D. and I.D. of the mating piping? The O.D. of the mating piping is 6.625". The I.D. is 3.373".

<DESC>The 311th Human Systems Program Office, (311 HSW/YA), Brooks AFB, Texas is preparing to release the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) Program, System Development & Demonstration with Production Options (SDD/Production) contract on 17 June 2002.  The draft RFP is located in the Files Link below.  Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  We anticipate a single award for the SDD/Production effort; production would be an option on the SDD contract. A small business set-aside is not considered appropriate for this program effort.  The SDD contract will feature a cost-plus award fee (CPAF) pricing arrangement. For the Production Options, the offerors are required to submit proposals under a Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) arrangement; in accordance with FAR 16.403-2 (a)(2), the parties will negotiate a fixed price contract arrangement after the completion of the Physical Configuration Audit.  The estimates for SDD and the production options are $25 and $282 million respectively.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 336413.  The contract award will be based on full and open competition.  In order to maximize opportunities to all offerors, potential offerors were notified of program progress and given instructions how to optimize their potential for successful award of the SDD/Production competition.  On 9 May 01, the San Antonio RFP and Acquisition Highway (SARAH) and Commerce Business Daily Notice to Offerors posted information to all offerors, excluding the current Program Development and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contractors, that requested the following items by the listed dates in order to be a potential offeror for the SDD/Production contract: Funding documentation to support their pro-rata share of Government Testing - 30 Jun 01 System Design Information (Conceptual Drawings) - 30 Sept 01 14 Test samples each Material - 31 Oct 01 25 Prototypes - 30 Jan 02 . During SDD, the successful offeror will translate their design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design; validate the affordability and producibility of the system, prove the production processes; and demonstrate system performance to specifications through testing. The proposal evaluation will rely substantially on results of the prototype unit Government testing.  Therefore, offerors who were unable to submit their prototypes and their share of the Government test funds, will not meet minimum criteria in the selection process.  During the  next phase (SDD) the following activities will occur: Developmental Test &Evaluation (DT&E), man-rating, safe-to-fly certification, Operational Testing &Evaluation (OT&E), technical data development, provisioning of spare parts, Functional Configuration Audit (FCA), Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Production Readiness Review. The Government will base its decision to enter production on the results of DT&E, OT&E, production readiness, and system affordability. Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles will be used to meet technical requirements at a price the user is willing to pay. Teaming or partnering within industry allows for the most promising technical design and expertise. Please indicate how teaming or partnering will be considered in your approach.  We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 17 Jun 02.  The RFP will be issued via the SARAH homepage internet address:  http://sarah.brooks.af.mil/  (Click on 311 HSW Human Systems Program Office.  Find solicitation number - F41624-02-R-1007 and click on it.  Scroll down to the bottom and click on the files link.)  Information concerning this acquisition will be updated at this location   Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this draft RFP require clarification in order to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing via e-mail to the POC only.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. Michael Higgins at (937) 255-6005.  All proposals must be received by 4 p.m. CST, on the closing date.  The closing date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP.  The anticipated closing date is 19 Jul 2002.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance and proposal due dates.  Proposals must be addressed to Ms. Ynuaka Newsome, Contracting Officer; 311th Human Systems Program Office / YACN; 7909 Lindbergh Landing; Brooks AFB, TX  78235-5306.  Responses and inquiries may also be directed to the Contracting Officer, at ynuaka.newsome@brooks.af.mil, voice 210-536-4571, or fax 210-536-2993.

<DESC>This solicitation is being issued as a SOLE SOURCE in accordance 
with PART 13, NTE $16,000.00.  This announcement constitutes the  
only solicitation; And a written solicitation will not be issued.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Statistics Canada?s generalized automated coding software: ACTR (?Automated Coding by Text Recognition?) uses a data-driven approach to the assignment of standard codes from text.  ACTR includes tools for maintaining a database of textual entries known to correlate strongly with a particular code.  Because it performs coding based on text retrieval, ACTR is independent of the coding strategy and language in use.  ACTR may be used in batch mode to perform unattended coding of well-defined cases, and in interactive mode for the coding of ?problem? cases.

ACTR will be used for a CE production system at the Census Bureau.  

FEATURES

IDENTIFY SOURCES OF CODE AND TEXT CORRELATION:

To use ACTR, a coding database must first be created.  This is entirely under the control of the user, which allows ACTR to be easily custom tailored to your application.  Sources of text and code correlation vary, but popular sources include captured text from previous surveys as well as coding reference manuals.  Regardless of what source is used to create the database, ACTR allows updates at any time.  As a result the longer ACTR is used in a survey, the greater the coding success rate becomes.

CREATE CODING DATABASE:

ACTR provides a complete set of tools for both batch and interactive creation and updating of coding databases.  These tools readily allow for ?What if? analysis to be performed while still in the process of defining a coding strategy.

MODIFY PARSING STRATEGY?

At the centre of ACTR?s text retrieval capabilities is a text parsing process which is highly user directed.  Users have control over such considerations as character mappings, trivial words, prefixes, suffixes, etc.  The system also allows users to control the order of the parsing process.

Delivery shall be 25 days ARO. FOB destination - WASHINGTON DC.
The point of contact for all information is Joe Rudolph, Purchasing Agent, at the address and phone number listed above.
If your response is not received by the date/time and at the location specified in the announcement, it will not be considered.
Offerors may download the solicition accessing the FedBizopps web-
site at www.fedbizopps.gov.  All future information about this 
acquistion will also be distributed through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to 
ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this 
acquisition.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Contracts Office (NAVFACCO), Port Hueneme, California, has been tasked to do the study at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) for Administrative Support Services. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 50 positions by the Office of Legislative Affairs on 23 January 2001, this action will comply with procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved will include visual media support, technical librarians, technical writers, administrative support, facilities (building management), and command security. The functions being affected by this A-76 study are located in Port Hueneme, California, and Washington, DC. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by Government personnel to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a factor equal to or greater than ten percent of the Government personnel cost. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in NFESC, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with secret information; therefore, the company and some of its personnel must have a secret clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete the required study. The expected term of the contract consists of an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months. A performance-based combination firm fixed price with indefinite quantity contract is anticipated. The majority of work will fall within the fixed price category. The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561110; size standard - $5,000,000.00. This requirement will use a Best Value Source Selection process, and is reserved for companies in the Small Business Administration 8(a) Program using full and open competition with a 10% Price Evaluation Adjustment for Hubzone companies.  (Please note that you do not have to be a Hubzone company to compete; you must be a certified 8(a) firm.)  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of this requirement will be limited to the electronic medium; this requirement will be available for viewing and downloading, free of charge, via http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. The official planholders list will be maintained on, and may be printed from, this website.  All prospective offerors and planrooms are required to register as planholders on this website.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as described under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  FAR 52.215-3 applies.  The U.S. Department of Treasury Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) has an existing requirement to identify, move and track its inventory of paper, dyes, inks and other materials through its production process and as finished goods into shipping.  The BEP has determined that commercially available equipment and associated software could greatly increase the automation of the current storage, retrieval and delivery system, and the tracking of materials and finished goods through the process.  Industry comment is sought regarding the requirements as stated under the attached MS Word 2000 document entitled, ?Acquisition for Automated Storage, Retrieval, and Delivery System?, and the attached MS PowerPoint 2000 document which shows the floor-space requirements.   This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for bid and proposal expenses regarding any response or follow-up to this RFI.  You are encouraged to respond to this RFI if you possess the requisite system and software.  The BEP will utilize any responses to this RFI, together with any prior market research, to formulate BEP's requirements for any request for proposals which might develop at a future date.  Potential respondees to this RFI should contact Mr. James Swann directly at 202-874-0108 regarding an appointment to tour the applicable facilities; the BEP reserves the right to limit tours to vendors of interest to the BEP; specifically, to those vendors who have previously developed and/or sold all or portions of the requisite system and software as defined above.  The time and place for submission of a written response to this RFI is as identified earlier in this notice.

<DESC>Kaiser-Hill Company, L.L.C. (herein referred to as 'K-H') is the Integrating Management Contractor at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) near Denver, Colorado.  The purpose of this announcement is collecting product literature on commercially available shearing devices that can handle the material type identified in this announcement.  K-H is currently evaluating alternative methods for the disposal of material in its Building 371 Complex.

Specifically, K-H may have a requirement for a hydraulic shear to size-reduce ingots of compacted tantalum metal.  The ingots, once they are removed for a compactor, will have the approximate dimensions of 13-inches x 8-inches x 2-inches.  The size-reduced pieces, once they are removed from the shear, will need to have the approximate dimensions of 2-inches x 8-inches x 2-inches.

The shear will be required to fit within in the confines of a glove box and have a foot print of no larger than 30-inches by 30-inches, exclusive of the hydraulic pump and controls and be no more than 20 inches in height.  The shear must weigh no more than 250 pounds.  The hydraulic pump and controls may be located external to the glove box.  The shear would have to be capable of passing through a 20-inch x 20-inch opening when either fully intact or with simple disassembly/reassembly (i.e., the shear consists of easily disassembled and reassembled modules).  The hydraulic pump would have to operate on 120VAC and contain no more than one gallon of fire resistant hydraulic fluid.  The pump and the shear would be required to be connected with hoses equipped with quick-disconnect fittings.  Interlock controls are anticipated to be needed to ensure that operators' hands are not in danger during operation.  The shear would be required to come equipped with appropriate guards and shields to ensure against personnel injury and damage to equipment from projectiles potentially generated during the shearing process.

This request is for purposes of determining product availability, delivery time, and rough order of magnitude cost for budgetary purposes.  An off-the-shelf item is preferred over an engineered, custom-designed unit.  Actual purchase of the shear will be dependent on availability of funds.

Companies shall provide product literature detailing unit dimensions, weight, and shear capacity for each recommended model.  Any system limitations shall be clearly identified. A statement regarding what modifications, if any, are necessary to existing product designs is also requested.  It is K-H's preference that shears that do not require modification, beyond standard options, be submitted for consideration.  Country of origin/manufacturer for each model shall be identified. Copies of any published price lists shall also be provided in a separately marked envelope. 

Product literature shall be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (Mountain Standard Time) on 06/07/2002 to Ms. Straub either via facsimile at 303-966-7899, by e-mail at elizabeth.straub@rfets.gov, or by mail at following address:  Kaiser-Hill Company, L.L.C., Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, 10808 Highway 93, Building 130, Room C127, Golden, Colorado, 80403-0200.  Ms. Straub can be reached via telephone at 303-966-5871.

<SUBJECT>99 -- GSA Great Lakes Region - Request for Information Re: Purchase & Installation of a Fuel Cell
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for the purchase and installation of a fuel cell consisting of 100 kilowatts (kW) or larger.  GSA requests all interested and qualified parties submit information that addresses the below-listed comments and criteria.

1. GSA is contemplating the installation of a fuel cell of 100 kW or larger at the Ralph B. Metcalfe federal building, 77 W. Jackson St., Chicago, IL 60604.  This fuel cell would be wired to certain electrical circuits within the building to provide power during the day and shall be wired to the electrical grid for feeding surplus electricity into the grid after building hours.
2. The best fit for a fuel cell at this location would be a cell that also generates excess heat so that development of a combined heat and power design could be considered. There is a natural gas feed to this building, however consideration will also be given to cells that use sources other than natural gas as the primary fuel mix.
3. This building houses as a major tenant, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and also is designated as a "Federal Energy Saver Showcase Facility."  As an "Energy Saver Showcase" building, this facility has photovoltaic solar panels on the roof and generates substantial interest from business, industrial and civic groups who tour the facility.  
4. It is GSA's desire to partner with a business entity that would be willing to absorb some portion of the project costs in return for guaranteed exposure (publicity) through the Federal Energy Saver Showcase Program, as well as a potential for selling directly to all federal government agencies through the Federal Supply Schedule.

This partnership could encompass one or more entities such as fuel cell distributors and/or manufacturers; energy providers such as Utilities; energy services companies or some combination thereof.  The partnership could include a purchase and installation agreement or some other arrangement such as a lease/purchase option. Other "buy-in" ideas are encouraged to be submitted with your information.

In the case of information submitted by firms other than fuel cell manufacturers, such as Utilities and energy services companies, include data on the fuel cell firm and equipment that is intended to be used.
5. As this is a RFI, the government also wishes to accept information from entities that may not be able to enter into a cost-sharing partnership. 

6. Interested parties should also include in the RFI basic information regarding your firm, such as:
a. Length of Time Company has been incorporated.
b. Capitalization of company.
c. Proof that your firm is currently in production of fuel cells 100kW or larger such as technical and market data; or as with Utilities and energy services companies, documentation that you are currently or propose to be in a contractual relationship with a fuel cell manufacturer.
d. If your company is in beta besting of fuel cells 100 kW or larger and are not currently in production, provide your company's history as requested in Items (a) and (b) above, along with a comprehensive time line for production.

The government shall review all submissions submitted. In the event submissions indicate a positive atmosphere for further action, the government may formally issue a solicitation or Request for Proposals.  The submission of a RFI has no contractual authority and is not binding on either party. Information submitted shall be held in confidence by the government.

Please submit your RFI by 4:00P.M. (EST), June 14,2002 to the following address:
		Larry A. Lewis
		General Services Administration
		Suite 209
		670 Morrison Road
		Columbus, Ohio 43230

Questions concerning the RFI may be directed to Mr. Larry Lewis at (614) 469-7350.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Positioning System (GPS) III Industry Day
<DESC>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office will be holding a GPS III industry day on 13 June 2002 from 0730-1800 hours in Los Angeles, California.  Further details will be provided upon registration.  Only potential prime contractors with one-on-one meeting appointments need to be present for the afternoon hours (1500-1800).  Registration is required for attendance.  Please register for this event by contacting 2nd Lt John Enis electronically at john.enis@losangeles.af.mil or by telephone at (310) 363-2793 no later than 7 June 2002.  Registration request should include: first and last name, Social Security Number or other proof of U.S. Citizenship, company name, level of interest (prime or sub-contractor), business size and FAR part 19 socio-economic status (such as small disadvantaged), and a copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  A nominal fee of $5 per person is required.  Due to facility constraints prime contractors are limited to 20 attendees and subcontractors are limited to 5 attendees.  Additionally, due to time constraints, the Government intends to limit one-on-ones to potential prime offerors.  A pre-solicitation notice will be released at a later date prior to the issuance of any solicitation.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW: The GPS III program objective is to develop and deploy an improved systems architecture for the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) to assure reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity, and timing (PVT) signals for the evolving needs of GPS civil and military users.  GPS III eliminates numerous existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities inherent in the current GPS architecture that threaten to severely impact vital civil commerce, transportation, public safety, as well as military operations in the future.  GPS III enhances U.S. leadership in space-based navigation by meeting the stated Presidential goal of establishing GPS as a world standard.  GPS III supports the Federal Radionavigation Plan and will be fully interoperable with all current global radionavigation systems. The GPS III system also incorporates the Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and provides a potential platform for supporting additional synergistic payloads and services. The contract effort of the GPS III program involves the selection of a single prime contractor to complete the systems engineering, deliver a control segment, and develop, launch and test on-orbit four (4) demonstration satellite vehicles.  During this stage, the Government will request space vehicle production proposals and seek formal program approval to field the GPS III system.  The Government intends to use an evolutionary development approach.  This approach includes using a modular open systems architecture, standard interfaces and protocols, and continuous technology refresh, to incrementally improve system capabilities with a low risk of GPS service interruption. 

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (for any resulting solicitation): This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) and SAP/SAR (Special Access Program/Special Access Requirements) security requirements.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and GPS III technical data are subject to export controls.   Therefore, only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of any resulting solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-888-352-9333) or http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation.  

PROGRAMMATICS:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis.
