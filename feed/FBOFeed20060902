<CONTACT>Robert  Egan, Contracting Officer, Phone 540-665-2669, Email Robert.R.Egan@tac01.usace.army.mil
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:     The Government intends to secure the services of a responsible and technically capable contractor to provide all services for real property operations, preventive/predictive/on-call repair and maintenance services (O&M), repair and improvement services (R&I) and housekeeping services to be performed at the Ibn Sina hospital and supporting facilities.  The resulting contract will be on a Firm Fixed Price basis with the exception of the Repair and Improvement line, which will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  These services are currently being provided by an incumbent contractor. Ibn Sina Hospital is located in the International Zone, Baghdad Iraq.  The hospital serves 75,000 military and civilians (both Coalition Forces and Iraqi).  The campus consists of approximately 30 medical, administrative and ancillary buildings.  The main building consists of approximately 5,437 square meters.  The outlying buildings, totaling approximately 11,736 square meters, are located within a two-mile radius of the main building.  The hospital corridors and waiting areas are heavily congested due to the high patient load.  The contract will have an initial period of performance of six (6) months (plus mobilization) with three additional six-month optional periods of performance.  The resulting contract for O&M, R&I and Housekeeping services will  result in stated services being provided to Ibn Sina Hospital and supporting facilities for a period of up to two (2) years and forty-five (45) days, if all options would be exercised.  There is no guarantee that optional periods of performance will be exercised.  The resulting contract will be funded incrementally and award is subject to availability of FY07 funding.  All work and materials shall conform to the standards set forth in the scope of work.  The estimated cost of this project is between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 if all optional periods of performance were to be exercised and is subject to availability of funds.  The solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.502 and 5.102, therefore, hardcopies will not be provided.  The solicitation will be posted on the Baghdad Business Center at http://www.baghdadbusinesscenter.org/tenders.asp#CORP and Fed Biz Opps at http://www.fbo.gov.   The estimated issue date of the solicitation is 22 September 2006 and the estimated proposal due date is 30 October 2006.  Estimated date of contract award is 1 December 2006 with initial mobilization beginning on 2 January 2007.  The Base Performance period will begin on 16 February 2007 and end on 15 August 2007.  Email proposals will not be accepted.  Both a price proposal and a technical proposal will be required. 
CORPORATE REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor?s on-site management shall have experience in providing said services in a hospital environment.  The on-site management must have gained this experience in a full-service hospital of similar or larger size than Ibn Sina.  Experience must include management and performance of services similar in scope and complexity in all areas of the hospital providing full services in health/patient care environment (i.e. OR, inpatient, outpatient, ancillary and dental).  TECHNICAL PROPOSALS:  Proposals will be evaluated for Past Performance, Company Management Plan, Subcontractor Management Plan, Quality Control Plan and Price.  The Government reserves the right to amend or add to technical factors prior to the issuance of the solicitation.  PRICE PROPOSALS:  Will be evaluated with Mobilization Cost, Operations and Maintenance and Housekeeping as a Firm Fixed Price.  Additionally, the burdened labor rates, overhead percentage and  profit percentage for the cost reimbursable Repair and Improvement services will be evaluated. Price proposals will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate, the price proposals of all offerors and overall reasonableness when compared to the technical proposal.  A Best Value Tradeoff process contracting method will be used to evaluate proposals. The Government will award to the offeror determined to have presented the best value to the Government. Best value does not necessarily mean awarding to the highest ranked technical proposal or to the lowest price, but rather to the contractor that provides the best possible combination of high technical factors and low price.  Evaluation criteria will be stated in the RFP.
CAUTION:  This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidder?s mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet addresses in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in rejection of same.

The UTM Company is the only vendor in the commercial market that meets specific training safety requirements that are essential to reduce the risk of serious personal injuries using training non-lethal projectiles.  In addition, UTM products will significantly reduce equipment maintenance and replacement cost for the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC).   At present, UTM offers unique ballistic features that guarantee great reliability, exceptional performance, and a wide-range of training applications for the Diplomatic Security (DS) warrant service and dignitary protection-training programs.  These UTM products will be used to support the High Threat Tactical (HTT) training program currently being offered by DSTC. The DSTC Special Skills Branch (SSB) has put the UTM products through a comprehensive evaluation under field training conditions.  These UTM products consist of both Man Marker Rounds (MMR) and Battlefield Blank Rounds (BBR), and protective equip.  The evaluation was part of DSTC search for a training projectile that would minimize training injuries for the DS high threat protection and room entry tactics programs.  Instructors with vast tactical experience evaluated the UTM products during several training cycles.  In addition, students with diverse law-enforcement and military background were given the opportunity to evaluate the UTM products.  The results were highly favorable.  Furthermore, the MMR/BBR was tested against the most common non-lethal projectile training system that is currently being used within the law enforcement community and various units in the U.S. Armed Forces.  Without a doubt, the MMR/BBR proved to be a superior product.   UTM’s unique characteristics allowed the students to maintain consistent shot accuracy up to 25 yards.  It also permitted the students to properly use their weapon sights, thus re-enforcing the correct marksmanship fundamentals.  Moreover, it significantly reduced weapon malfunctions due to barrel fouling and accumulation of wax residues in the bolt chamber.  Instead of requiring students to wear bulky and restrictive protective equipment, the MMR/BBR allowed the students to wear normal clothing for training.  This was an important factor for adding realism to training. Conversely, the other commercial product proved to be less suitable for force-on-force training applications.  The system is available in both 5.56 mm and 9mm.  The key features of the UTM include the following: 1.  The UTM ammunition marks the target whether it hits a soft or hard target, whatever the angle and whatever the impact velocity.  The marking projectile is “NOT” required to break open. The projectile is a plastic cruciform dome, over an aluminum sabot, which contains a marking compound and a small 3mm inertial body behind the marking compound.  When fired the inertial body is under acceleration and stays to the rear.  When the projectile hits a target the outer body is slowed and the inertial body moves forward expelling the marking compound.  UTM projectiles have a metal to metal contact inside the barrel on each firing.  No plastic contacts the rifling or other residue is left in the barrel.  The marking compound does not freeze and works in the temperature range of –20 C to +40 C. 2.  The fundamental technology behind the UTM system is a two primer, expanding cartridge made of two hollow zinc die-cast parts, which fit or seal together to form a piston.  The cartridge only contains TWO primers.  No other propellant is used.  A rear primer fires a small plastic ball forward down the inside of the cartridge case and simultaneously fills the piston with gas causing it to expand and “blowback” the bolt or slide.  A second, smaller primer is located forward in the nose of the cartridge behind the projectile.  It is in line with the rear primer and is fired by the plastic ball.  This front primer is used solely to propel the lightweight composite projectile.  The combination of the cleanest explosive available and aluminum jacketed bullets provide a clean ammunition system, which is trouble free from misfires, mis-feeds or barrel fouling. 3.  The advantages of the UTM system are that the energy is required to perform the two functions are kept separate.  The rear primer responsibility is to cycle the weapon. Cycling the weapon typically takes 40-60 ft/lbs in a rifle or pistol.  The forward primer provides constant velocities to the projectile.  A projectile, which is safe at the muzzle, must have less that 3ft/lbs.  By separating the energies, cartridges can be made to operate weapons with a heavier cycling requirement (like the M249) will NOT produce any different muzzle velocity if fired from the M16. 4.  Lead free, heavy metal free primers are available for the propelling primers, which vent to atmosphere.  The cartridge system contains all the gas from the rear primers.  However, currently no manufacturer in the world makes “NON-TOXIC” rim fire cartridges.  The UTM MMR/BBR does not fracture the SWD (Ballistic) lens when fired point-blank.  I personally experienced a shot fired at a distance of 4-6 inches.  The UTM does not penetrate skin when fired at a lightweight type of clothing.  This is extremely important for added realism training.  Other products (such as a simunition, and paint ball) require heavier type protection equipment  to safely conduct training. 5.  The UTM system does not alter the reliability of the weapon system.  The system is technically capable of shooting a 41 mm x 100 mm group at 25 meters from a fixed barrel gun). In normal (hand held use) a 2” group at 10 meters from pistols and 4” group at 30 meters from rifles is readily achievable.  The ammunition functions the weapon in a full climatic range –20 C to -40 C. In summary, UTM provides the world’s safest and most accurate training munitions (non-toxic) and weapon conversion kits.  The MMR/BBR would permit tactical training instructors to make training scenarios safer and more realistic. It would also allow tactical instructors the ability to facilitate learning and provide the most accurate performance feedback to the students. This should be an important factor for any security or law-enforcement organization that has very limited time and opportunities to train and qualify its personnel in the proper application of lethal force while exposed to high stress conditions.  Unquestionably, the BBR would improve skill proficiency and better prepare DS Special Agents for domestic and overseas missions.  Additionally, it would also reduce equipment replacement cost and alleviate maintenance workload for the instructor staff, which is extremely critical to maintain the training center’s operational tempo.  Furthermore, major training institutions such as the Federal Law-Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), military units, and private companies are currently adopting this training system into their training programs.

<CONTACT>Andrew Toller Contract Specialist 9076443312     Andrew_Toller@nps.gov;
<DESC>Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), number Q9929060032 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  This is total small business set-aside procurement.  The Small Business size standard is $6 mil.  The NAICS is 811310.  The contract will be awarded as a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.  The requirement is for providing and installing a new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system for the purpose of providing continuous conditioned power to the network infrastructure for the National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501.  When responding to this RFQ contractors shall provide pricing as follows: CLIN 0001, Provide and Install MGE Galaxy 4000 Data Center UPS OR EQUAL and disconnect and remove existing 18KVA UPS system; turn over to NPS IT Personnel for disposition.  $_____________  The quote must include all costs of installation including any necessary transformers or other ancillary equipment. MANUFACTURER'S LITERATURE OF THE PROPOSED UPS SYSTEM MUST ACCOMPANY YOUR QUOTE TO EVALUATE TECHNICAL RESPONSIVENESS. The proposed UPS system shall be capable of providing the following specification:  1. SCOPE. This item describes the requirements for the Contractor to provide and install a new 40KVA 3-Phase UPS System and remove the existing 18KVA UPS system at the NPS Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage AK 99501.  The old 18KVA UPS system once removed will be turned over to NPS IT Personnel for Government disposition. (Government retains ownership).   2. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE UPS SYSTEM:  The UPS system will replace an existing single phase, 18KVA UPS system with a minimum of a 3-phase 40 KVA system.  The building is equipped with an emergency generator which assumes the load within 2 minutes of a power interruption therefore the proposed UPS must only be rated to provide a minimum of 10 minutes of output at full load.  The system will be located on the first floor, in the location of the existing UPS system, and will supply 3-phase power to one or more distribution panels in the 2nd floor server room.  The proposed system must be expandable to at least 50KVA without increasing the footprint beyond the approximate 3.5 foot X 6 foot area (exclusive of transformers) occupied by the current system.  The UPS system proposed must be manageable via an Ethernet network and any necessary software must be Microsoft Windows compatible.   3. SPECIFICATIONS:  All UPS power distribution must be from a breaker panel located in the server room.  The preferred location for the distribution panel is indicated on the accompanying server room diagram along with the existing Electrical panels and UPS outlets.  The existing 110 volt UPS outlets on the walls and near the 72 inch racks will be moved over to the new UPS system.  The 110 volt UPS outlets above the cabinets will be replaced with new outlets located more toward the front of the cabinets.  The panel nearest the door is a 3 phase 208/120 volt 100 amp panel that feeds the non-UPS outlets in the server room as well as lights and outlets in the adjoining Information Technology office and lab areas.  It also feeds the network distribution rooms on each floor.  The electrical panel currently furthest from the door is a single phase panel that feeds UPS power to the thirty two (32) 110 volt and four (4) 220 volt outlets indicated by red and green triangles in the drawing. (email Andy Toller at Andrew_Toller@nps.gov for instructions to download this drawing).  New 110 volt outlets must be mounted beneath the overhead wire basket location at or near the position shown on the diagram.  The cabinet nearest the door is the only one requiring 220 volt power.  Two (2) 110 volt outlets will be added to that cabinet.  The two (2) 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks will be converted to 110 volt UPS outlets.  All outlets will be locking to eliminate the adaptors currently in use.  The UPS outlets along the wall currently are fed with a single 20 AMP circuit for four (4) outlets while the other UPS outlets are fed with two (2) 20 AMP circuits each feeding duplex outlet.  The outlets that are just being switched from the old UPS to the new UPS will not change this scheme, however, the outlets being replaced above the cabinets will only require one (1) locking outlet per circuit.  The panel(s) installed will have sufficient breaker capacity to increase the number of 110 volt UPS circuits from forty-two (42) to sixty (60) so that future expansion will only require the addition of circuit breakers, conduit and outlets within the room.  The installation must include a "computer room kill switch" installation next to the server room door that will remove power from all UPS outlets in the event of an emergency.  The switch must be physically protected from accidental activation.  The NPS may specify the location of up to an additional five (5) UPS outlet locations during installation and should be addressed in the contractor's quote.  The project must include the complete and accurate labeling of all circuits and circuit breaker panels.   4.  PHASING/SCHEDULING OF WORK (PROPOSED):  The installation must be accomplished with a minimum of interruption of service.  To accomplish this, the following procedure will be followed:  1. The new distribution panel(s) and new 110 volt outlets will be installed and wired.  2. The existing system will be switched to bypass (moving the load directly to commercial power) and then the existing UPS can be disconnected.  3.  The new UPS system will be installed and wired, tested and activated.  The unused 110 volt outlets on the walls and the 110 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks that will transition to the new UPS can be moved to the new panel at this time.  The unused 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks may be rewired as 110 volt at this time (one will be relocated two (2) feet at this time).  4.  Equipment with redundant power supplies will be moved (hot) from the old outlets to the new UPS outlets during normal business hours.  5.  The switchover of any equipment that is both critical and does not have redundant power supplies as well as the 220 volt ESN equipment will be scheduled after 6:00 PM in coordination with NPS IT Personnel.  6. Distribution rooms on each of the floors can be switched from their current panel to the new UPS panel during normal business hours.  7. The bypass switch, the old single phase panel, the abandoned 110 volt outlets and all associated conduit can be removed at the end of this work schedule.  NOTE:  The NPS is open to a different sequencing proposal which constitutes an improvement over the above description without increasing the length of disruption in service.   5.  SCHEDULED SITE VISIT:  There is a scheduled site visit set for September 12, 2006 starting at 1:00 PM local time.  Interested vendors should meet NPS personnel in the lobby of the NPS Alaska Regional Office at 240 W.  5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501 at 1:00 PM where they will be escorted as a group into the area where work is to be preformed.
