The Department of Energy purchased three (3) of these systems from Halo Photonics and evaluated them in October 2010. ARL wishes to evaluate the other manufacturer's product with the intent to distribute their findings to other DoD organizations. DOE has already provided the Army with their evaluation of Halo's three (3) systems.<BR><BR>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  <BR>

GSFC intends to increase the IDIQmaximum ordering value of the current contract NNG06HX14C with SGT, Inc. to allow for thecontinuation of services for the ordering period of February 1, 2011 through July 31,2011. This is a six month extension to the existing period of performance of thiscontract.  This additional time is required to allow for the follow-on procurement to becompleted and allows time for the 30 day phase in. The increase in the maximum orderingvalue is necessary due to the growth on the GGSG contract which reflects the large andmulti-disciplinary scope of GSFCs interests. Given the multidisciplinary focus of thisprogram, GSFC anticipates continued growth as more tasks are undertaken throughout theremaining period of the contract.     SGT, Inc., as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience, and expertiseto provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support. Due to the time andcost impact involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, SGT is consideredthe only contractor that can meet GSFCs needs given the short period of performanceremaining on the contract.

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the goals of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics is to dissect the genetic basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated in large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach will identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. To accomplish this goal, thousands of patient DNA samples are sequenced each year to identify common gene variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This genotyping is done using a well-established, high-throughput sequencing platform that utilizes ABI Prism&reg; BigDye&reg; Terminator (BDT) cycle sequencing chemistry.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ requires the procurement of alignment blocks for the Common Video Borescope Set (CVBS), which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with GE Inspection Technologies (GEIT) located in Skaneateles, NY. Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, GEIT is the sole designer and manufacturer of the CVBS and the technical data rights are proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The CVBS is a stand-alone unit with limited replaceable components. One component that is replaceable is the optical tip adapters. All tip adapters are direct "plug and play" replacements with the exception of the defect measurement adapters. When replacing the defect measurement tip adapters a separate alignment block is required. Algorithms within the CVBS software use this block to align the system with the physical characteristics of that specific defect measurement tip adapter. This process is required to ensure the CVBS meets the required measurement accuracy. The U.S. Navy has a requirement to procure these alignment blocks to ensure that each CVBS that is fielded meets all operational requirements. The government does not possess the technical data rights to compete the requirement. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the results of environmental chamber testing of auxiliary power units (APUs) fitted or equipped with diesel particulate filters (DPFs) on representative Class 8, sleeper cab equipped, trucks with 2007 or newer engines.  Emissions and other relevant environmental impacts data and analysis from the APUs testing will be used to inform the SmartWay Transport Partnership's Idle Reduction Technology (IRT) Verification Program and EPA's proposed heavy duty truck greenhouse gas regulations.
Market research conducted by EPA has determined that the Texas Transportation Institute is the only environmental chamber testing facility that can meet of all OTAQ's test requirements which are as follows:  
Drive-in environmental test chamber that can accommodate a full size truck. 
Chamber capable of maintaining both 0?F (for cold condition) and 100?F (hot condition) while truck engine is running at high idle under 20 mph wind load (cold condition) and solar load (hot condition), while maintaining 50 percent relative humidity.
Emissions testing equipment that can measure nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), total hydrocarbon emissions (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and flow rates on a second-by-second basis.
Fuel flow meter to measure fuel consumption on a second-by-second basis.
Ambient monitors to measure ambient air quality (NOx, CO, and THC) in the chamber and truck cabin. Current and voltage sensors to measure energy levels on a three to five second basis.
Noise meter to measure in-cab noise levels.
Temperature sensors to measure temperature levels inside the chamber and at six key points inside the cabin.
Heavy duty diesel truck(s) with full size sleeper cab that can be used for the installation of idle reduction technologies.
No solicitation or Request For Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response which, if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government shall have the&nbsp; unilateral option&nbsp; of exedning the&nbsp; term of this contract for&nbsp; 4 consecutive additional periods of 5 months each.</strong>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt; TEXT-INDENT: -27pt"><acronym><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></acronym></p>
<p>All work shall be performed between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm, Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, unless specifically approved or requested by the COR.</p>
<p>The services will be performed during the growing season on a cycle approved by the COR to maintain the outside area in a neat and clean manner. Policing areas to remove trash and other cleaning issues will be done by the Janitorial staff during the off season and between scheduled landscaping visits as directed by the Property Manager.</p>
<p>The "prairie" is approximately 1.3 acres of native plant and wildflower species. It is intended to offer a sustainable design which offers improved storm water management, enhanced habitat within the urban core. It promotes sustainability while requiring less watering and fewer soil amendments. The prairie has been receiving regular maintenance since its inception in 2003. We are seeking a Contractor with experience in managing native prairie sites to continue the program.</p>
<p>The prairie is primarily populated with the following native plant species:<br />&bull; Wild columbine<br />&bull; Butterfly weed<br />&bull; Heath aster<br />&bull; Sand coreopsis<br />&bull; Wild lupine<br />&bull; Black eyed Susan<br />&bull; Lillie bluestem<br />&bull; Smooth aster<br />&bull; Purple coneflower<br />&bull; Blazing star<br />&bull; Wild bergamot<br />&bull; Stiff goldenrod<br />&bull; Showy goldenrod<br />&bull; Tall coreopsis<br />&bull; Switch grass<br />&bull; Yellow coneflower<br />&bull; Indian grass<br />&bull; Downy sunflower</p>
<p>The plants are cut down each spring in lieu of burning. The Contractor will be expected to make two day visits to the site per growing season and provide expertise, labor, material and supervision to maintain and manage the prairie to include but not limited to elimination of exotic and non-native species, woody encroachment of non-native species, prairie enhancement, removal of trash, and minor repairs.</p>
<p>The formal demonstration garden is a 30' x 10' crescent with a lawn edge. A maintenance plan for the formal demonstration garden will be required.</p>
<p>If maintenance tasks will be required between visits, the Contractor will train the current groundskeeper to do any interim maintenance required.</p>
<p>The contractor will supply all garden tools, supplies and herbicides to perform the prairie maintenance done during their visits.</p>
<p>The janitorial contractor will maintain any adjacent lawn and maintain a very neat edge where the lawn meets the prairie plants. The Native Prairie contractor will cut down, rake and clean the prairie each spring in lieu of a controlled burn.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide a written mid-summer report each year on the condition of the prairie to include:</p>
<p>&bull; Written assessment of the condition of the prairie<br />&bull; Photos of the prairie to demonstrate the condition<br />&bull; Recommendations for ongoing maintenance strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will award a contract resulting for this solicitation&nbsp; to the responsible offeror who proposal conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government based on evaluation.&nbsp; The evaluation factors to be&nbsp; used are&nbsp; total&nbsp; evaulated price and past performance.&nbsp; Past performance is significantly more important than price.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Proposals will include the following elements:<br />A resume of experience which demonstrates an understanding of sustainability and native species gardens <br />Past performance information including similar projects within the past 5 years<br />Maintenance Plan for Formal Demonstration Garden (QCP)<br />Maintenance Plan for Informal Prairie (QCP)<br />Plan for use of chemicals <br />Safety Plan<br />Estimated annual cost of seed and plants to maintain site<br />Fixed Price to maintain site<br />Description of reporting plan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as FedBizOpps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You may access FedBizOpps via the following URL <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">https://www.fbo.gov</a>.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, Andover, MA, to modify an existing cost plus fixed fee contract (W9113M-08-C-0153) to meet requirements of the Government. The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. This action is to provide continuing bridging support for the RAID Legacy and RAID BETSS-C systems under the Product Management Office, Integrated Tactical Systems (formerly RAID PO).  Award to any source other than Raytheon would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost. The Government does not possess the technical data packages at this time and therefore has to procure through the original manufacturer. The contract planned period of performance is from 1 February 2011 to 30 September 2011. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards Raytheon Company.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.<BR>  All responses should be directed to Mr. John D Mason, at john.mason@smdc.army.mil, and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The proposed contract action is for supplies or support that the government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is to negotiate a sole source contract, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  This synopsis is being issued for information purposes only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are not available.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sea-Bird Electronics for the purchase of Sea-Bird Electronics replacement and back-up equipment for the Seabird SBE 911 Plus Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) Units currently in place at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p><br />The following replacement and back-up equipment is required:<br />&bull; SBE 4C CTD Conductivity Sensors are the primary sensors of the CTD used to measure conductivity<br />&bull; SBE 3Plus CTD Temperature Sensors used to measure temperature with a demonstrated drift of less than 0.001 &deg;C during a six-month screening period and a time response of be 0.065 &plusmn; 0.010 seconds.<br />&bull; CTD Dissolved Oxygen Sensors used to measure oxygen<br />&bull; 24-Position Carousel Electronic/Release, hub assembly and bail assembly, which is a release latch assembly and integrated electronics module for a 24-bottle oceanographic carousel water sampler<br />&bull; Deck Unit for 911 Plus CTD supplies DC power to the CTD, decodes the serial data stream, and passes the data to a computer</p>
<p>Sea-Bird Electronics is the only known vendor to provide replacement and back-up equipment that is compatible with the Seabird SBE 911 Plus CTD. To replace existing equipment with a brand other than Sea-Bird Electronics is not cost effective.</p>
<p>The Seabird SBE911 Plus (CTD) is one of the primary tools used by AOML scientists for determining essential physical properties of sea water. It gives scientists a precise and comprehensive charting of the distribution and variation of water temperature, salinity and density that helps understand how the ocean affect life. The shipboard CTD is made up of a set of small sensors attached to a large metal rosette wheel. The rosette is lowered on a cable down to the seafloor, and scientists observe the water properties in real time via a conducting cable connecting the CTD to a deck unit that interfaces to a computer.</p>
<p>Specifications of the SBE 911plus CTD:</p>
<p>&bull; Produces profiles of ocean temperature, salinity, and density at the highest possible absolute accuracy and high resolution sampling (around 24 Hz)<br />&bull; Interface temperature sensors that are both accurate and fast. The absolute resistance of the thermistor at the ice-point only changes by about 1 ohm/mk. <br />&bull; Has a drift of no more than .001 &deg;C in six months <br />&bull; Has a response time of about .010 seconds and a measurement range of -5 to +35 &deg;C<br />&bull; The conductivity sensor is electrically isolated to eliminate any possibility of noise and corrosion caused by ground loops. <br />&bull; Has a measurement range of 0.0 to 7.0 Siemens/meter (S/m) and a resolution of .00004 S/m<br />&bull; Equipped with a pump that is constantly providing a flow of water to the temperature and conductivity sensors so that they measure the same water<br />&bull; Equipped with a quartz pressure sensor and housing rated from 0 to 10,000 psia. <br />&bull; The resolution of the pressure sensor is 0.001% of full and have a typical stability of .018% of full scale per year<br />&bull; Interfaces to SBE's, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen sensors and pumps<br />&bull; Interfaces to a SBE 11plus V2 Deck Unit<br />&bull; Equipped with eight 12 bit A/D channels and a built-in NMEA 0183 interface to merge real-time GPS data with the CTD data</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the replacement and back-up equipment compatible with the Sea-Bird 911 Plus CTD may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (816) 274-6993 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation: NB687020-11-02090BS<br />Title: Broadband Horn-Type Dual-Ridge Guide Antennas<br /><br />***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with ETS-Lindgren L.P. of Cedar Park, TX, for purchase of broadband horn-type dual-ridge guide antennas.<br /><br />***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for broadband horn-type dual-ridge guide antennas that meet NIST specifications for use in testing wireless devices in a small anechoic chamber. The antennas must cover the frequency range from 1 GHz to18 GHz, and manufacturer data must demonstrate a pattern gain that is not degraded in the frontal lobe at higher frequencies. The ETS-Lindgren Model 3117 dual-ridged guide horn antenna satisfies this requirement. The Model 3117 has been designed to provide better on-axis gain performance when compared to the traditional design of dual-ridge guide antennas. As reported in peer-reviewed literature, the traditional design suffers from gain loss of 4 to 6 dB due to splitting of the main lobe at higher frequencies. The Model 3117 was designed specifically to avoid degradation of the pattern for on-axis measurements. The wider main lobe is important for measurements that will be made in the NIST small anechoic chambers, because the pattern presented to the device under test will be more uniform at close proximity. Lack of a uniform field would require extensive additional characterization and calibration steps causing unacceptable delays and cost increases. Delivery date shall be 45 days ARO. <br /><br />***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for C-130H Segment II (A1U) Electronic Flight Display System (EFDS) units
<p>This is not a request for proposals. This is a request for information only and no contract will be awarded based on responses to this announcement.</p>
<p>The US Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking information on small businesses that manufacture Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) Electronic Flight Display System (EFDS) units that will operate in the USCG HC-130H Avionics I Upgrade (A1U) Project. The EFDS must be readily available and certifiable for installation and integration into commercial and military aircraft. The USCG is not searching for C-130 system software integrators at this time. The NAICS is 334511 and the applicable Small business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The USCG HC-130H long range surveillance maritime patrol aircraft is undergoing a series of upgrades to enable the continued effective and safe operation of the HC-130H through the year 2027. The A1U architecture will integrate and manage different hardware/ software systems &amp; equipment, most of which have not been previously employed in the HC-130H. The Flight Management System (FMS) will use the CDU-7000 (proven successful for Navy, USCG, and Army avionics upgrade projects) to control all data and information flow to and from the EFDS components. The EFDS subsystems will contain digital "glass cockpit" integrated flat panel displays (aka multifunction displays), their data processors, a Caution Warning &amp; Advisory Panel (CWAP), an Electronic Chart Server, associated Display Control Panels (DCPs) and Hand Controllers.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: The USCG is seeking information from any small business Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) that manufactures a COTS EDFS that fits into and works with the current A1U design and HC-130H legacy systems. The EFDS must readily accommodate the existing physical, functional, and information processing and display requirements for the A1U system and its discrete subsystems. This shall include applicable CNS/ATM exhibition and other performance requirements of the EFDS such as: <br />-Display of Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation (RNP RNAV) data<br />-&nbsp;Display of required Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro VNAV) data<br />-&nbsp;Display of communication radio data<br />-&nbsp;Display of dual Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) data<br />-&nbsp;Display of dual ARN-118 TACAN, dual ARN-123 VOR, ARN-149, and DF-430 data<br />-&nbsp;Control and display of digital map<br />-&nbsp;Control and display of electronic chart data<br />-&nbsp;Display of Terrain Avoidance &amp; Warning System (TAWS) data<br />-&nbsp;Display of Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) data<br />-&nbsp;Display of flight director data<br />-&nbsp;Display of Streaming Video<br />-&nbsp;A Host for the Electronic Charts<br />-&nbsp;A Stand Alone Caution Warning &amp; Advisory Panel<br />-&nbsp;Display Control Panels and Hand controllers</p>
<p>Replies:</p>
<p>The responses should include cage code and CCR small business self certification for NAIC 334511 along with product information for EFDS units being manufactured. Responses shall be emailed to Mr. Danny Sawyer, Contract Specialist, at Danny.R.Sawyer@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking information from any C-130 Aircraft Depot Maintenance Provider capable of installing a new, OEM-manufactured center wing box (CWB) into a C-130H aircraft in accordance with OEM developed drawings and procedures, all provided as government furnished equipment. In order to optimize its small fleet of C-130H's, the USCG prefers that the Depot Maintenance Provider also possess the capability to simultaneously complete additional structural inspections and repairs on other areas of the C-130 in accordance with USCG directives, procedures, and non-destructive inspection/evaluation procedures, most of which are derived from USAF and OEM standards. The purpose of combining the CWB change and additional inspections/repair work is to satisfy all Coast Guard requirements for its 48-month Progressive Structural Inspection/Programmed Depot Level Maintenance program while the aircraft is down for CWB replacement. Again to optimize limited availability, the Coast Guard prefers that the Aircraft Depot Maintenance Provider be capable of simultaneously installing a modern "glass cockpit" and avionics upgrade as developed and directed by USCG. The Coast Guard will complete a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 16 CWB installations, and these may be combined with aforementioned additional structural inspection/repair and/or avionics upgrades as directed by the USCG on a case by case basis. The NAICS is 336411 and the applicable Small business size standard is 1500 employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The USCG currently operates an older fleet of 22 HC-130H aircraft and plans to extend the service life of a number of these aircraft through 2027. In order to accomplish this goal the USCG will have to replace several CWB's and complete an avionics modernization project to safely and effectively extend service life. The USCG will purchase new CWB's directly from the OEM and each kit will include the main structural shell as well as all of the internal components. The Aircraft Depot Maintenance Provider will be responsible for assembling the complete CWB with all the internal components as well as the removal and installation onto the aircraft and complete the project through functional check flight. This highly complex and technical installation requires significant investment in specialized tooling and access to onsite engineering support, thus the USCG desires to mitigate cost and schedule risk by working with well established Aircraft Depot Maintenance Providers experienced with C-130 CWB removal and installation. The USCG has developed its own avionics upgrade architecture and may elect to have it simultaneously installed while an aircraft is down undergoing a CWB replacement. This avionics upgrade package will be delivered as a government furnished equipment kit along with a USCG technical order specifying the installation procedure. The USCG may also elect to complete additional structural inspections and repairs on other parts of the aircraft to satisfy its Progressive Structural Inspection and Depot Maintenance requirements. The USCG desires to start work in fall 2011 and complete approximately one aircraft per year. The avionics upgrade will not be available as an option until final airworthiness testing is complete, approximately 2013. <br />REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via Email to the two points of contact listed above. Request responders include cage code, website and capability statement that identifies similar projects. Provide business size.</p>

<DESC>The USDA, ARS intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a six month Firm Fixed Price contract with a small IDIQ component for facilities operations, maintenance and administrative support services at Southern Regional Research Center in the Mid South Area with Celta Services (CS). The contractor is required to provide work such as, but not limited to, work management, building alteration and repair maintenance, shop services, grounds maintenance, automotive and farm vehicle maintenance, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, pipefitting, housekeeping, safety, building security services, walking patrol service and administrative support services effective February 1, 2011.. This site is under a modernization effort and the contractor is required to interface with other Contractors onsite. The SRRC mission is to develop through basic applied and developmental research, new knowledge and technology that will ensure an abundance of high quality agricultural commodities. The research is conducted on agricultural commodities to improve food safety, emerging and exotic foods borne allergies of people, improve research on the production of peanuts, rice, cotton and enhanced tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses that are valuable to the U.S. and world economy. This research involves the reliance and cooperation of the local community, universities, industry, other countries and state agencies. The contractor is responsible for maintaining the facility in full support of the research mission. The government is in the process of evaluating offers for a follow-on contract that will contain a base period with four option periods. To that end, it is vital to the research mission of the SRRC that the incumbent continue to provide O&amp;M support. This 6 month bridge contract is necessary to allow for sufficient time to complete the recompetition procedures for the follow on contract. No other offeror could immediately perform all of the required services within the necessary timeframe and a period of performance of six months is an insufficient timeframe in which to transition a new contractor.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: RPP Containers, 12151 Best Place, Cincinnati, OH.  45241. <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide heavy duty, collapsible bulk containers with the following requirements:  The containers must have exterior dimensions of 78" length, 48" width, and 34" height with interior dimensions of 74.5" length, 44.8" width, and 27" of usable height.  The containers must have forklift tine holes on all four sides of the box.  The container must be capable of being slung beneath a helicopter in flight without breaking.  Collapsed height of the container shall be no higher than 13".  Container load capacity shall be no less than 1500 lbs.  The containers must be stack-able in both the collapsed and assembled configurations.  Static stacking of assembled containers at maximum capacity shall be four high.  The container shall weigh no more than 250 pounds.   One short side of the rectangular container shall contain a hinged door allowing for access to container contents without dropping the entire short side of the container.  The small door shall be no smaller than 15" high by 30" wide.  <BR><BR>The equipment being procured will be used for field testing in theater.  These items represent the 80%+ solution with input from the field we may get the 100% solution faster by designing to the units needs rather than fielding an untested system. The Army units requesting the capability are currently deployed to Afghanistan and have asked that the items be delivered by 1 Jan 2011.  A delay in the procurement of these items will lead to a reduction in the units' effectiveness and ability to conduct their sustainment missions in a wartime winter environment, resulting in serious injury to the Government.  This restricted capability will have a ripple effect to all supported units.  As sustainment brigades providing logistical support, their mission is an integral part of the war effort.  Without the required supplies provided by the sustainment brigades, or with a delayed delivery due to equipment availability, other Army units will be unable to conduct their missions.  Therefore, the procurement of this capability has an unusual and compelling urgency.  Units in the field in a wartime environment cannot wait for the normal contracting and source selection processes to be conducted when they have an immediate need.  Request an option be placed on the purchase contract for an additional 100 boxes subject to funding availability.<BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on January 10, 2011. <BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<BR>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<BR>

<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered.

<p>Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, shall be approximately equally important to Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />The</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Under Compacts of Free Association signed in 2003 as amended in 2004, responsibility for disaster services for two Pacific Island nations - the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) - was transferred from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to USAID. Emergency humanitarian relief and reconstruction costs will continue to be financed from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. But the programs, which have been administered by USAID since November 2008, will be exempt from FEMA's Stafford Act, which governs domestic FEMA activities.</p>
<p>The two island nations consist of 1,800 islands (comprising 340 square miles, mostly uninhabited) spanning 2,000 miles across the northwestern Pacific Ocean. They have a combined population of 180,000. Between them, the two nations account for three million square miles (about five percent) of the western Pacific Ocean, an area triple the size of the South China Sea or the Mediterranean. In the past forty years, the nations have been affected by disasters including typhoons, mudslides, wave surges and droughts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the independent status of the two nations, a transition from FEMA to USAID administration was decided upon in the bilateral negotiations which concluded the 2003 Compact agreements. Consistent with these decisions, the countries will continue to receive, in general terms, the type and quality of humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance that FEMA had provided. The program will be administered by USAID free of some FEMA regulatory restrictions and with a more hands-on implementation approach. From consultations with several entities, a FEMA/USAID "hybrid" strategy was developed. The Operational Blueprint, co-authored by FEMA and USAID, is the principal guide for the Contractor's activities and for humanitarian relief policies, programs and operations to be supported.</p>
<p>The major FEMA/USAID humanitarian disaster assistance to the islands which is the subject of this agreement will be predicated on FSM/RMI Presidential disaster declarations. Additional predicates will be (a) an initial disaster declaration by the U.S. Ambassador and requests through the Embassies for routine up to $50,000 disaster grants from USAID/OFDA; (b) FSM/RMI use of an appropriate portion of the jointly-financed contingency Disaster Assistance Emergency Funds provided for by treaty and pending establishment; and (c) FSM/RMI requests for international assistance to the United Nations. A joint FEMA/USAID assessment will determine if the disaster qualifies for a U.S. Presidential declaration, which would trigger access to FEMA funds.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a USAID Disaster Assistance Coordinator (DAC) for FSM and RMI, based in the U.S. Embassy in FSM/RMI. The DAC will serve as the principal manager and coordinator for all aspects of readiness and implementation of the humanitarian relief policies and programs provided for in the applicable FEMA/USAID Operational Blueprint.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The DAC will perform the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as lead USAID manager for emergency response.<br />&bull; Manage USAID preparedness and mitigation activities.<br />&bull; Serve as principal USAID programmatic point of contact for the implementing partner(s), contractor and other USAID agreements in support of the FSM/RMI program.<br />&bull; Advise Asia Bureau and FSM/RMI Ambassadors, Deputy Chiefs of Mission and Embassies on challenges, plans, operations and problems concerning the disaster relief program.<br />&bull; Work closely with host country disaster community to develop disaster response protocols, systems, and agreements.<br />&bull; Develop and maintain active working-level contacts with federal civilian and military agencies, coordinating programs with them as appropriate and where such coordination can maximize U.S. Government efforts.<br />&bull; Supervise local employees.<br />&bull; Review FEMA/USAID Operational Blueprint and propose modifications as necessary, based on continuing assessment of field requirements and on lessons learned from disaster operations.<br />&bull; Facilitate independent audits and evaluations; incorporate findings and recommendation in on-going and future disaster response and reduction activities. <br />&bull; Represent USAID at inter-agency meetings.<br />&bull; Participate in pre-typhoon season conferences.<br />&bull; Participate at program reviews in OFDA/Washington.</p>

The USAID DAC will maintain continual communication with OFDA/Bangkok and with the two Embassies in the region. Foreign policy guidance and strategy, as well as other support, will be provided by the Embassies.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The incumbent is expected to work with a high level of independence. He/She will establish priorities, adhere to and meet established deadlines, and perform responsibilities and duties with minimal guidance and little or no follow up. The incumbent must be able and willing to work additional hours beyond the established 40-hour workweek and outside the established Monday to Friday workweek as may be required or necessary. The incumbent is encouraged not to take annual leave during the main typhoon season between the months November through April.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. Q1574111012Amendment 0002January 5, 2011
Project Title:  Kitchen Remodel, Yellowstone National Park.
Receipt of Offers: The hour and date for receipt of offers remains unchanged at 2:00 pm local time on January 6, 2011.
Description of Changes:  This amendment provides for some changes to the existing combined synopsis/solicitation by replacing the following language in the specification with regards to the bathroom vanity unit:"This Cabinet Order also includes one bathroom vanity unit 42", (drawers down the left side and cupboard in the center and on the right side under the sink), a single white porcelain sink, all specifications for the cabinet wood, design, hardware and counter-top with back splash and end splash shall be the same specifications, and colors as the cabinets and counter-tops for the kitchen and pantry cabinets above."Please replace the above information in the solicitation with the following revised specifications for the bathroom vanity unit:"This Cabinet Order also includes one bathroom vanity unit.  Base cabinet shall be a 48" vanity base (drawers down the left side and cupboard in the center and on the right side under the sink).  There shall be a 6" filler strip on the right end of the base for the baseboard hot water heating lines to "die" into and run through.   The vanity top shall have a single white porcelain sink centered over the cupboard space.  The vanity top shall have an overall width of 54" to cover the 48" base and the 6" filler space.  All specifications for the cabinet wood, design, hardware and counter-top with back splash and end splash shall be the same specifications, and colors as the cabinets and counter-tops for the kitchen and pantry cabinets above."
This amendment is also to provide information in response to the following written requests provided by interested individuals:1.  Comment was "The center line for the wall sconce lights in the bath are apx. 15-1/2" and 47-1/2" from the right wall.  If we take a 42" wide "vanity" cabinet, and center on those, we have more than 10" of space between the end of the cabinet and the side wall.  We will propose a 4-1/2" wide "filler" for the heater to run into and allow the cabinet door to open, but a 6" "gap" will remain.  We suggest that the vanity width be increased by 12" (6" on each side of the light fixtures).  Let me know if this fails to make sense or if I have misunderstood.  I am assuming that the light fixtures are traditional wall sconces and not bar lights (adjustable in location left to right)."Response - "Upon receipt of your concern we re-evaluated the bathroom vanity specifications, and we concur that the 42" vanity will not center on the wall lights. Also if we would center the 42" vanity with the wall lights we then create a 10" space in the corner that will look unfinished.  We have determined that in order to better center the vanity with the wall lights and enclose the space in the corner where the hot water lines run, the vanity base cabinet needs to be a 48" cabinet (with drawers on the left and the sink and cupboard on the right side as we originally requested),  with a 6" filler strip on the right side of the cabinet for the hot water pipes to "die" into and to run through.  The new Vanity counter-top needs to be 54" wide to cover the 48" cabinets and to cover the 6" filler space.  Please see the above changes to the specifications."
All other terms remain in full force and effect.
Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified in the solicitation or as amended by one of the following methods:a)	Signing and dating this amendment and returning with offer;b)	By acknowledging receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted; orc)	By separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the solicitation and amendment numbers.FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OFFERS PRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.If by virtue of the amendment you desire to change an offer already submitted, such change may be made by telegram or letter, provided each telegram or letter makes reference to the solicitation and this amendment, and is received prior to the opening hour and date specified.

<DESC>THIS REQUEST IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO 28 FEB 2011.

DESCRIPTION: In accordance with FAR 5.205, PEO Submarines is seeking sources that can potentially provide technologies applicable for incorporation into the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) and associated Technology Insertion (TI) efforts under sponsorship of Program Executive Officer Submarines (PMS425). 

The overall end state objective of this SWFTS effort  is to provide improved command decision making performance and reduce the time and cost associated with upgrades to the submarine combat systems elements and attack center.  SWFTS subsystems typically encompass the following command level functions: mission planning and rehearsal; contact detection, classification and tracking; multi sensor contact management; command team decision making;  post mission reporting;  safe maneuvering of the submarine platform; and effective employment of submarine payloads.

The goal of this sources sought is to identify emerging, new, or modifiable hardware and/or software technologies and concepts that are potentially applicable for near and long term future submarine Command And Control Center (CACC) designs through FY20.
  These technologies may include advanced display devices, human computer interaction techniques and computer processing that show promise to improve the command decision team interaction with the systems and also potentially reduce the size, weight, power and cooling demands that the system places on the platform.  The focus is to identify advanced research and development concepts that are sufficiently mature so that they may be assessed with respect to their ability to meet program objectives. 

Interested vendors shall submit a five-page (maximum) white paper in response to this announcement that describes their technology as it relates to the key functional areas of submarine command and control attack center operations.
  Descriptions should include identification of key technologies or algorithms, current state of maturity, results achieved to date and project sponsorship.  

Inquiries, questions and submissions shall be directed to Maria Gregory via email at maria.gregory@navy.mil.  Responses are due no later than 2:00pm on 28 FEB 2011.  This should not be construed to be a request for proposal or a solicitation of an offer.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.
  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.

Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  
Instead, they may be accessed at our web site 
http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in 
our Bid Room.

<DESC>Modification to RFI # VA798A-11-RI-0040
This Modification 1 to RFI # VA798A-11-RI-0040.  The purpose of this modification is to clarify the maximum page limit for response to this RFI.  Item #6 of the technical capabilities statement has been updated to reflect the maximum 15 page response limit.  All other information remains unchanged.

Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the VA is looking for sources able to  provide an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS). The VA understands the breadth and depth of the desired RTLS solution and is looking to determine the ability of industry to provide a total integrated solution.  

Overview

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities. (Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1) VA medical centers (VAMCs) within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

VHA seeks a turnkey, integrated RTLS to be deployed nationwide.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals for RTLS are to:
o	Improve operational efficiency
o	Decrease operational costs 
o	Maximize equipment utilization
o	Increase clinical efficiencies and staff productivity
o	Reduce delays in patient care
o	Minimize lost and misplaced items
o	Improve the quality of service from patient, physician, and institution perspectives
o	Provide medical centers with the real-time capability to actively track all assets, medical supplies, staff, patients, and environmental conditions (point source monitoring of items) through a common interface and reporting tool.
o	Provide national-level reporting and information sharing through an enterprise database

For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment within one or more VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software, all necessary hardware (servers, receivers, ID tags), services (installation, integration, maintenance, training) and any additional ancillary equipment for tracking of equipment, implants, staff and patients.

Requirements

VHA is seeking potential sources capable and interested in providing an enterprise RTLS for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, specimens, instruments, staff, and patients, among other possible uses.  In addition, environmental monitoring such as humidity and temperature will be required.  VHA is also interested in the ability of a single source to provide multiple technologies for deployment (using existing wireless infrastructure, non-wireless infrastructure, or contractor specific infrastructure) and the ability to use multiple tags and technologies to meet specifications and specialized needs.  All RTLS data from a given facility must roll up into a single database, and be accessible via a single user interface.  The RTLS system at each facility must also be capable of exchanging data with VA information systems and with RTLS systems at other facilities and/or with a single national information system that serves to aggregate and display RTLS data from all VA facilities.

For the purposes of this RFI, VHA has defined the following space areas.  Please consider all of these areas when responding to relevant questions. 

Campus	Multiple Buildings on an area of land belonging to a facility.

Building	A free-standing structure

Floor	An entire level in a building

Zone	A defined area on a floor:  multiple spaces

Room	Smaller unit on a floor / zone.  Has a defined entrance / exit point.

Individual Patient Care Vicinity	A designated area within a room.  Bed or Bay area.
 

The range of RTLS capabilities with which VHA wishes to begin with initial deployment, shall include but are not limited to the following:

A.	Asset Tracking Capability - Provide VHA staff with the capability to locate portable assets used throughout the medical facility to support the delivery of health care services; varying levels of discrimination should be offered to meet site specific requirements from area level discrimination to more discrete room level discrimination in real time.  

B.	Supply, Processing and Distribution (SPD) Automation Capability - Enhance SPD business processes through automation as it supports SPD staff responsibility for tracking, cleaning and distributing medical equipment to clinical staff throughout the medical facility by automating the tracking tasks.  

C.	Inventory Management Capability - Monitor the usage of medical supplies and equipment necessary for critical patient procedures, particularly in specialty labs, such as cardiac cath.  RTLS solutions in these areas provide real-time transparency for designated items that are "on the shelf", used in a case, or missing.  The RTLS solution can support par level maintenance to ensure maximum efficiency and availability of a wide range of hospital supplies and equipment.

D.	Automated Temperature Capability - Provide real time temperature monitoring for refrigerated areas that store pharmaceuticals, tissues, organs, blood, food, and other items at specified temperatures.  The system can monitor and record temperatures at predetermined time intervals and immediately report any temperature anomalies based on configured thresholds.

E.	Business Process Workflow - Track hospital staff and patients at VA medical facilities, with the objective of monitoring business activities, such as tracking a patient presented to the Emergency Department from arrival to disposition.  The goal is to improve workflow through analysis of the monitoring data provided by the RTLS.

F.	Technical Engineering Services - Required services may include Software Configuration; Upgrades and Updates to all delivered software; Technical Engineering Services (Installation, De-installation, Relocation of RTLS components), Middleware Development services, Commercially available Middleware Services; System Integration; RTLS Implementation Support; Software Development Services; Maintenance, Warranty and Training.  Solutions shall integrate all technology to provide a transparent solution to the user.

<DESC>Expression of Interest Sought

This is a modification of a requirement posted in the Federal Business Opportunities website on November 24, 2010.  Since the initial posting, the lease term of the proposed requirement has changed.  
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently occupies 34,760 net usable square feet of clinical space in a building under lease in Savannah, GA, and has a requirement for a short term lease of this same size in the following delineated area.

The offered building must be located within the following boundaries:
North â€“ Highway 80 / Highway 26
East â€“ Skidaway Road/Drive
South â€“ East/West Montgomery Cross Road / Abercorn Street / Highway 204
West â€“ Highway 17 / Highway 25

VA seeks to lease approximately 38,000 rentable square feet of clinical space located on one or two floors; if the space is located on two floors, those floors must be contiguous.  The rentable square footage should yield 34,760 usable square feet of space.  The lease term requirement is for five years including all options.  The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2011.  VA seeks a full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent).

VA will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making the determination for lease award during the solicitation phase of this procurement VA will consider, among other things, the costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs,  replication of tenant improvements and IT/telecommunications infrastructure.

Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include: building name, address and age; total square footage available (ANSI/BOMA) office rentable and usable, and its location within the building; date of space availability to commence tenant improvements; rental rate per ANSI/BOMA office rentable square foot (indicate core factor) (specify services and utilities included); CAD â€œas builtâ€ floor plans identifying the space offered; parking ratios; loading dock specifications; proximity to public transportation; and information on building ownership. (Note:  VA will pay no more than the appraised fair market rental value for space.  Usable square footage does not include areas such as stairs, elevators, mechanical and utility rooms, ducts, shafts, vestibules, public corridors, and public toilets required by local code).  

All interested parties should respond to this announcement no later than January 12, 2011. Please include: name of firm, name of contact person, address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address. 
All responses shall be made to the following:
