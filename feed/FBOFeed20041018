<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates awarding a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of 25-30 million doses of inactivated egg based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic and evaluate pilot lots of novel (e.g., avian) influenza virus vaccines.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country, and local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only (within the boundaries of the CONUS).  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN:  Peter Penny, 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3705, Atlanta, GA  30341.  Emails should be sent to Peter Penny at pmp7@cdc.gov.

<DESC>This funding notice is relevant to the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge System only. The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), National Wildlife Refuge System, administers the Service's Challenge Cost Share program.  Challenge Cost Share (CCS) funds are congressionally appropriated monies designated for the protection and conservation of wildlife resources.  This is a federal matching funds program which leverages federal dollars with non-federal sources.  In addition to money, these federal dollars can be matched with in-kind valuation assigned to non-federal contributions such as labor, equipment use, material and supplies.  The non-federal matches may be contributed by State and local governments, private individuals, private organizations, business enterprises, and charitable groups.  Service policy dictates that no more than 50 percent of the total cost to implement the project may come from federally funded sources.   Explicit funding for the CCS program has been authorized by Congress since 1988.  The Refuge System Administration Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to administer this program.   The CCS program encompasses awards made through both federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This "call for proposals" is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  A twin posting of this call for proposals # 701815R001 has also been posted on http://www.grants.gov The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge System invites the submission of new proposals in support of Alaskan natural resource management and science camps, both as components of the 2005 CCS program.  Project proposals must demonstrate a strong relationship between a non-federal group and an Alaskan U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office. This is the initial announcement for this funding opportunity.  The CCS program is an annual funding source set up on the federal fiscal year schedule; therefore, the objectives and work identified in the proposals selected for award under this announcement must be completed no later than September 30, 2005.  Proposals must be delivered to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office at 1011 East Tudor Road, Anchorage, AK by 4:00 PM on December 10, 2004.  Proposals may be mailed to the address below and must display a postmark earlier than December 11, 2004. There is no solicitation packet to request, nor is there a "bidder's list".  Please input the following URL into your web browser to read the funding opportunity announcement followed by a LINK to a .pdf containing program parameters, evaluation criteria, and award information:  http://alaska.fws.gov/nwr/visitor/grants.htm  http://alaska.fws.gov/nwr/pdf/costshare_fa.pdf

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice to announce the pending issuance of a Request For Proposal (RFP) for a Firm-Fixed Price type contract for one Base Year and four One-Year Options to provide Atmosphere and Space Research, Development, and Program Analysis support for the Air Force Technical Applications Center's (AFTAC) Nuclear Treaty Monitoring requirements.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract to provide support to accomplish this mission, which will include both Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and Research and Development (R&D) type tasks.  Operational requirements are met through the deployment of space-based sensors and special ground processing equipment.  These satellite/sensor/ground data processing systems collectively makeup the Atmosphere and Space (A&S) portion of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS).  Detailed analyses is performed from data collected by Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) sensor suites hosted on Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and NUDET Detection System (NDS) sensor suites hosted on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and passed to AFTAC by the USNDS ground segment of the A&S LAN.  The associated ground data processing systems that provide data include the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the Advanced RADEC Data Units (ARDUs), the NDS Analysis Package (NAP) ground segment, and the AFTAC Low Intensity Signal Event (ALISE) processor.  This data is passed and stored on a distributed client-server automated information system called the A&S LAN that contains data analysis software used to support the A&S USAEDS mission.
Performance Requirement:
The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and other services necessary to perform the work specified above.  The majority of the work will be performed at Patrick AFB, FL.  Specifically, the contractor shall perform the following activities: algorithm development; Research and Development (R&D); event characterization process improvement; continued A&S analysis program development and/or expansion; requirements capture; functional design of capabilities for analysis applications; “on-line” help documentation update and/or creation for application software; new data source incorporation into software and data processing baselines; software configuration and control, software validation and testing; technical evaluation of software and database test procedures; promote the transition of software and data; training of personnel in the use of new or revised applications; user-training materials update; on-line analysis tools upgrade and maintenance; technical meeting attendance/participation, and A&S LAN change documentation.

Additionally, the contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of requirements analysis and the ability to assess system and operational documentation to support decision-making. The contractor shall define a structured and documented approach for collecting requirements identified by users to provide feedback for software process improvements.  The assessment process requires definition and/or clarification of space and ground data processing requirements, generation of cost/benefit trade studies to evaluate system alternatives to meet validated requirements, and conduct of operational assessments. The products from this support include capability analyses, feasibility studies, risk analyses, operational analyses, and new program initiatives.

Knowledge of nuclear weapon phenomenology, extensive knowledge of satellite sensor operation and associated data processing, a working knowledge of both PC and UNIX operating systems, and an ability to program in C++ and other languages. Contractor personnel should also possess an ability to adapt to new sensor systems and ground processing systems while maintaining the Legacy data. (current system has approximately 3 million lines of code hosted on an Oracle database that requires management and real-time updating.) It is imperative that no loss of analytical capability occurs between the current support effort and this proposed support effort.

A history of relevant work is required.  Key contractor personnel should possess experience and have the ability to use the Atmospheric and Space analysis tools and applications discussed above.   Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in performing software validation and testing in the AFTAC mission areas outlined above is required.  

Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to TOP SECRET/SCI is required. Storage and Facility clearances of at least the SECRET level are required.

A Technical Library will be maintained with Points of Contact (POCs) posted in the RFP.

Anticipated RFP release date is 2 NOV 2004.

All responsible sources  may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses,
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and universities. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) addresses a need that is becoming more serious as the nation’s emergency responder community prepares to combat the results of
future terrorist attacks – highly innovative/revolutionary protective materials and materials systems that can be used by emergency responders and Homeland Security Operations professionals in multi-hazard environments. Many of the requirements presented in Section 3 have been derived from Project Responder1. The R&D efforts, however, are not limited to the basic guidelines provided in Project Responder2. As we
continue to assess operations resulting from terrorist or other mass destruction/mass casualty incidents, other national level guidelines will apply. Cross referencing applicable requirement and concept of operations documentation is encouraged and will
be assessed as part of the proposal evaluation process. This is a dynamic environment with rapidly changing and emerging requirements. It is incumbent upon all participants
in this R&D process to ensure that the collective R&D initiatives are responsive to improving protection against traditional and emerging hazards, and are applicable to a
wide range of Emergency Responder (ER) and Homeland Security Operations (HLS Ops) professionals. Safety, time, and operational effectiveness are among the most precious commodities to ER / HLS Ops professionals. Currently, those professionals use a variety of protective garments and systems tailored specifically for their individual area of expertise and occupational environments. While this approach has been moderately successful to date, it does not address the new challenges encountered and will continue to be encountered in both the near and far term. These missions will continue to include conventional response in multi-hazard environments, as well as the aftermath of terrorist incidents. 
The research, development and maturation of materials or technologies that can be used in multi-hazard environments must be applicable to diverse users, as well as integrated
into more complex systems. Focus will be on materials that are lighter-weight or reduce the weight of the overall personal protective system, that are robust and able to withstand
the challenges of strenuous activity in unstable and uncertain conditions (rubble, collapsing structures, flying debris, etc.) and environments (extreme heat or cold, wind,
rain, flash fire), and provide protection against a multitude of hazards (industrial chemicals, chemical or biological warfare agents, radiation, shrapnel, flying debris, other). The ultimate goal of this effort is a single material solution that protects against all hazardous conditions. However, a significant breakthrough in material integration that results in a material solution that protects against numerous conditions will be
considered. This BAA is being supported by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a Department of the Army organization. Programmatic inquiries relating to this BAA and
inquiries concerning white paper and proposal submissions will be handled by the HSARPA Program Manager. Other inquiries, including questions concerning requirements and contracting actions will be handled by either the HSARPA Program
Manager or the technical and contracting representatives at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center (see Section 7.11 for contact information).

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT - The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health, intends to award a 5-year (inclusive of options) contract, on a SOLE SOURCE basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.320-1 a database system from The MEDSTAT Group, 801 Crescent Centre Drive, Suite 400; Franklin, TN 37067.  The system is for use by the Office of Communications in continuing its ongoing audience segmentation and consumer profiling efforts.  The data provided are obtained using primary survey research on actionable healthcare issues with annual sample sizes of 100,000 households.  There is also the ability to access over 10 years of primary source consumer health care utilization trend data (over one million respondents), as well as the ability to add cancer-related questions to the contractor’s annual survey.  Additional research from other sources (public, private, and proprietary) is used to produce a fully comprehensive audience segmentation system.  The database system integrates the following components: 1) The PULSE Health Care Survey:  An annual national random-sample survey of approximately 100,000 heads-of-household covering sixty (60) major health care categories.  Survey analysis includes nationally weighted response rates for each survey question, as well as for each of the two neighborhood-level databases described below.  2) A neighborhood level market segmentation system: The system includes a license to use the PRIZM NE classification system from Claritas Corporation which classifies each of the census defined neighborhoods (Block Groups and Enumeration Districts) into one of 66 national neighborhood types.  The system also includes the classification for all neighborhoods in the geographical area covered by the system at the Block Group, Tract and ZIP level.  It also includes profiles of the consumer and media behavior of each of the 66 neighborhood types based on national syndicated surveys. 3) Neighborhood level demographic databases: The system includes a complete set of demographic data (150 data items) on each county, ZIP code, census tract, and block group/enumeration district within the local market area. 4) Media use optimizer: The system includes the ability to estimate the utilization of different types of media and product buying habits by lifestyle cluster and pair this information with health care utilization and health status information. 5) Advanced mapping/graphics: The system includes the ability to display on the computer screen and print the boundaries for counties, ZIP codes, and census tracts in any geographic area covered by the system.  Areas can be shaded based on any variable chosen from the databases (e.g., lifestyle clusters with below average mammography utilization rates), and/or each area can be labeled with the value of any variable from the databases.  In addition, this software allows for the overlay of streets, labels (e.g., zip codes, county names) and landmarks such as hospitals.  6)  Online access:  The entire system is accessible through the Internet so NCI can receive continuous updates to the system without having to upgrade its computer systems.  7) Decision support: The system includes stored applications intended to assist marketers and planners in evaluating options involved in marketing and strategic planning for reaching consumers, health providers and managed care organizations.  These stored applications include the retrieval and comparison of data, the preparation of maps, and the display of data in graphic formats. 9) Research support: the contractor will provide additional technical support such as identifying specific data sets and variables within data sets to further NCI’s behavioral research projects and develop upon request databases in the format for analysis of multiple variables over time. 10) Intranet application: Medstat will develop and deliver a custom, tailored, stand-alone intranet-based application with specifications which will provide regional offices of the Cancer Information Service with the ability to develop custom maps and reports using predefined, stored applications.   In addition, NCI has the ability to modify, expand, copy and/or add new “stored applications” to the system.  The planned period of performance is 5-year (inclusive of options).  Due to the proprietary nature of much of the data, as well as the integration of the all software components into one system, there is no other known vendor to provide the above data requirements.  It is the Government’s belief that the above specifications can only be met by The MEDSTAT Group.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, if an interested party believes they can meet the above specifications, they may submit a statement of capability.  Information furnished should include enough material, in sufficient detail, to perform a proper evaluation of their ability to perform.  Closing date is 45 days after publication of this notice.  SEE NOTE 22.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Yuan Zongben, Chairman, Shanxi Jincheng Anthracite Coal Mining Group Company, Limited, Bei Shi Dian Town, Jincheng, Shanxi, People’s Republic of China, 048006, Phone: (03-56) 366-3992 or 366-8607, Fax: (03-56) 366-3256 or 366-4446.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance program for a 120-megawatt (MW) coalmine/coalbed methane (CMM/CBM) fired power plant for the Shanxi Jincheng Anthracite Coal Mining Group Company Limited (JMC).  The objective of the proposed technical assistance is to assist Shanxi Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group with early design and engineering of the project, as well as assist in monitoring and supervising the implementation of the 120 MW CBM- and CMM-fired power plant over a fourteen month period.  

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) plans to approve a loan of approximately US$125 million to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Coal Mine Methane Demonstration Project (the Project) during-2004.  The Project comprises improved production of CMM via in-mine drilling, new CBM production from new surface wells, a 120 megawatt (MW) power plant fired by CMM and CBM, and transmission and distribution systems for commercial, residential, and industrial end users.  The proposed ADB loan will also fund project implementation, including engineering consulting services to finalize design components, supervise construction, monitor key project implementation activities, and provide training for key personnel. 

During the Appraisal Mission conducted in March 2004, the Government of China requested that ADB investigate possible grant funding to support consulting services for project implementation.  As a result, the Grantee and the ADB approached USTDA for grant funding to provide technical assistance for design, specifications, procurement, installation, commissioning, and monitoring of the power plant component.  The proposed ADB-financed CMM Demonstration Project will support the establishment of a CMM demonstration project that covers all aspects of effective and efficient CMM and CBM production, capture, and utilization by applying the latest technologies.  

In order to develop this project, the Sihe mine requires additional electricity for its operations.  Based on the projected production of CMM and CBM at the Sihe mine, a 120 MW power plant using the CMM and CBM as fuel is the least-cost alternative for power generation expansion along the power grid in Shanxi Province.  The power produced from the plant would eventually meet about half of JMC’s power requirements.  Currently, a prototype CMM-fired power plant is in operation at the site, which is comprised of 4 x 2 MW aero-derivative turbine generator sets.






The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $502,850 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., November 22, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing a Request for Comments (RFC) to solicit industry suggestions and advice related to products that will permit the Department to adhere to the requirements of the Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA). Specifically, Treasury seeks a FISMA compliant reporting tool that can be used by a wide range of personnel from all of its Bureaus. The tool must be intuitive for users and require minimal training to implement. Additionally the FISMA tool must provide functionality that permits hierarchical user and management control of data submissions; allows bureau users to enter data as draft or works-in-progress awaiting management approval; permits bureau management with the capability to review, edit, and submit FISMA related information to Treasury Headquarters; and segments data at the Bureau level while permitting Treasury Headquarters Management administrative access to all data. 

The RFC package contains a high level description of work, a list of questions soliciting vendor input and suggestions, and a copy of the Federal Information Security Act of 2002. This Request for Comments is not a request for proposals and the Department of Treasury is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of vendor responses to the RFC.

Interested parties may request the RFC from the Contracting Officer, John A. Palmieri, through email requests at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov. Responses to the RFC should provide information describing vendor commercial products that meet FISMA requirements, suggestions/information based upon the questions raised by Treasury in the RFC, and any questions for clarification resulting from the high level description of work should be submitted to the Contracting Officer by email at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov  by November 1, 2004.  Treasury will use the commentary and suggestions to develop and finalize the Statement of Work that will be used for the Request for Proposals (RFP) that will solicit offers for proposals from the vendor community.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if a firm has one o n file in ORCA.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at 503-808-4590, or by e-mail at caic.nwp@nwp01.usace.army.mil.

To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.

<DESC>The Government is canceling this synopsis for Captive Air Training Missiles and associated spares.  Due to a recent DFARS rules change, the USAF is not able to consolidate all of its CATM requirements into a single solicitation at this time.  The USAF will be breaking up its CATM requirements into multiple solicitations.  Each new solicitation will be synopsized individually.  The first of these synopses is currently being posted under the title of Captive Air Training Missile Wings and Fins.  Synopsis for the other requirements will be posted to FedBizOpps in the near future.  Any interested offeror should contact the buyer identified below for additional information.

This confirmation does not require an offeror to bid or participate in Due Diligence; it only ensures that the firm will be invited to participate in all parts of the Due Diligence.  Once a new date for RPF release is determined,  the release date will be posted to this website.

<SUBJECT>28 -- Industry Conference for Secondary Power Systems
<DESC>Ogden Air Logistics Center will host an industry conference November 18th at the Davis Convention Center in Layton, Utah.  We plan to address exciting purchasing and supply management initiatives underway in our Secondary Power Systems Commodity Division aimed at returning greater value to the Air Force.  Areas we wish to discuss include identifying new sources of supply, increasing the number of competitively purchased parts, improving the performance of sole source suppliers (where appropriate,) exploring new technologies that increase reliability and reduce lifecycle costs, and finding ways to reduce acquisition/production cycle times.  The bottom line is our strategies must contribute to a 20% increase in materiel availability, a 20% decrease in overall costs, and a 50% reduction in sourcing cycle time!  
The Federal Stock Classes (FSC) identified as “secondary power systems” commodities and targeted by this conference include 2805, 2815, 2835, 2910, 2920, 2930, 2950, and 2990.  
In addition to our conference presentations, we have scheduled a tour of our maintenance facility at Hill AFB on the afternoon of November 17th, which you are welcome to attend.  This tour puts our operations in perspective, and will help give you a better understanding of our requirements.  We also encourage you to meet with our team for a 30-minute, one-on-one session on November 18th or 19th to talk about what your company can offer, and how we might make improvements to our plans.  We will contact you to schedule a session once you’ve registered.
To register for this conference, please visit our website at http://www.hill.af.mil/lg2/SecPowerSys.  Registration opens on October 18th and closes November 5th.  A registration fee of $25 per person applies, which will be collected at the door.  We will post a detailed agenda and itinerary, maps, directions, and information on the local area on our website in early November, so please check back for updates.

<SUBJECT>U -- NOAA INTERAGENCY WORKSHOP
<DESC>The DOC/NOAA Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL), NASA Science and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates, and DOE Office of Science are sponsoring the second workshop on the Utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Global Climate Change Research on December 7-8, 2004 at the David Skaggs Research Center in Boulder, CO. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the technologies needed for transformational Earth observation capabilities, enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), that will directly support the Nation's weather research efforts and climate change observations charge under the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. It also supports the goal of the first-ever U.S. draft plan to monitor the Earth, which was released last month, and which will, over time, benefit people and economies around the world by improving the ability to monitor, understand and predict changes to the Earth. The workshop will focus on missions concepts developed in the August 3-4, 2004 precursor workshop held at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA. The results of that workshop are available at http://www.fsl.noaa.gov/uav_workshop/index.html. NASA, NOAA and DOE are collaborating to address the challenges of suborbital observations and to bring to bear advancing technologies, such as UAVs, as an integrated piece of a national and global Earth observation network. In particular the collaboration brings to bear the knowledge, expertise, and resources of each agency in a synergistic manner that responds to the President's challenge for America's Earth Science Community to take a leadership role in developing the International Earth Observation System. This workshop will offer attendees the opportunity to participate in discussions that will influence the development of near-term observational mission concepts and their associated technology portfolios. There will also be opportunity for a poster/exhibit session. For information on the workshop including registration, agenda, and directions information, please access http://www.fsl.noaa.gov/uav_workshop/index.html. Consider this workshop an opportunity to provide input on NASA, NOAA and DOE's future teamwork in suborbital observations supporting climate change and weather research, to foster collaborations and to develop possible partnerships. The points of contact (POCs) for inquiries are: Sara Summers for NOAA, (303)497-4221, e-mail: sara.summers@noaa.gov; Randy Albertson for NASA, (661)276-7540, e-mail: randy_albertson@dfrc.nasa.gov; Will Bolton for DOE, (925) 294-2203, e-mail: wrbolto@sandia.gov. Space for this workshop is limited. Please use the on-line form to indicate your interest in attending. The on-line attendance system will close-out on November 7th.  Based on attendance request inputs, the workshop planning team will determine the workshop make-up. It is intended that there will be significant representation from throughout the climate change and weather science and aerospace technology communities from government, academia and the private sector. An administration fee is required. The attendance list will be finalized and all who have submitted will be contacted by November 15th. Those selected will be provided further instructions. This announcement is for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation. There will be no award as a result of this announcement.

LOCATION OF SERVICES:  Orders may require performance of services anywhere within SPDs boundaries. The BPA Holder may team with other firms as necessary to provide services throughout this region.  TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS: The BPA Holder will be the prime contractor for any order placed under this BPA, regardless of any teaming arrangements it may make with other firms. The BPA Holder  will be solely responsible for providing the ordered services, and payment for the accepted services will be made only to the BPA Holder/Contractor.  LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACT: FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply to any order placed on a non-competitive basis with an 8(a) concern. THE BPA ORDERING PROCESS: As requirements determined by the Government to be appropriate for ordering under this BPA materialize, the government will issue Requests for Quotations (RFQs) to the BPA Holders. The RFQs will include 1) a Statement of Services describing the work to be performed; 2) any special contractual requirements that will apply to the order, to include delivery requirements/performance schedules; 3) any applicable Service Contract Act wage determinations; and 4) quotation preparation and submittal instructions. If interested in competing for the order, the BPA Holder must respond by submitting a quotation. The BPA Holder is not required to compete for every order. Quotations will generally c onsist of 1) technical/capability information, 2) a lump sum FIRM FIXED PRICE (inclusive of all labor, materials, travel, expenses, etc.), and 3) a price breakdown for the price quotation by labor categories with estimated hours at the established hourly r ates and all associated Other Direct Costs, to include printing and production costs, travel, facilities rental, ETC.  The government will evaluate every quotation that is timely received and will select the one that offers the best value to the Government , based on the criteria established in the RFQ. The government-authorized caller will then issue the BPA order to that BPA Holder. The order will be issued on a  firm fixed price basis.  The BPA order will cite appropriations and obligate funds. Upon acceptance by the BPA Holder, either in writing or by substantial performance, the order will become a binding contract between the Government and the BPA Holder.  OT HER SOURCES: This BPA is not a required source for obtaining the services described herein. The determination of whether or not to use the BPA to acquire such services is reserved exclusively to the Government. The Government may elect to use the BPA to ob tain these services, but is not required to do so. The Government may perform services in-house, may solicit and award other contracts for work which could have been ordered under this BPA, or may use other existing contracts (including Federal Supply Sche dules).  COMPETITIVE VS. SOLE SOURCE ORDERS: It is anticipated that most of the orders placed under this BPA will have been competed among BPA Holders.  However, orders can be placed against a BPA on a sole source basis when justified by the Government in accordance with current acquisition regulations. Additionally, orders can be placed on a non-competitive basis with any BPA Holder that is an 8(a) Contractor.  BPA FUNDING: No funds are or will be obligated under a BPA. All funds will be obligated against the orders, if any, placed under this BPA. BPA MINIMUMS AND MAXIMUMS: No work is guaranteed under a BPA.  Therefore, there is no minimum dollar value of work that must be ordered by the government under this BPA. There is also no maximum dollar value for this BPA.

BPA ORDER LIMITATIONS: Each order issued under this BPA will be for an amount exceeding $2,500 but not more than $100,000.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. The provision is attached.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

On an “as required basis”, the contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul systems and subsystems of the HH-60J helicopter Pump Module Assemblies, as necessary to conform with the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS), at the firm fixed prices specified in Section B.  
This PWS establishes the minimum requirements necessary to overhaul the Pump Module Assemblies.  Required overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Parker-Hannifin Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractors shall provide their own manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.
In order to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B, the contractor must have access to the parts and data furnished directly by the OEM.  Proposals shall include evidence of the foregoing access.  Piece parts shall be new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Data includes complete overhaul manuals and service bulletins of the latest revisions required to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS.  The following technical and operational directives are applicable to this requirement but are not deliverable under this contract.  Except where otherwise noted, the latest revision in effect as of contract award date applies. The information contained in this section is not intended to be all-inclusive nor to detract from or modify procedures outlined in the manufacturers drawings, specifications and service bulletins, except where specifically noted herein. 

3.1. MANUFACTURERS DRAWING AND SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have access to the latest required maintenance, overhaul manuals, and Original Equipment Manufacturer's Drawings, Specifications and Service Bulletins to ensure that equipment is overhauled, calibrated and operating in accordance with latest manufacturer's performance/test/acceptance specification criteria.  Drawings and specifications are proprietary and are not available from the Coast Guard.  Coast Guard does not possess nor can it supply the aforementioned.  The offeror will be responsible for obtaining all data.

3.2.  SERVICE BULLETINS:  The contractor shall be required to incorporate service bulletins issued prior to the date of contract if not previously accomplished.  The service bulletins will fall under overhaul to be accomplished in accordance with Original Equipment Manufacturer's latest commercial build standard and shall be included in the proposed overhaul price.
  
New service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this contract may create new part number configurations, i.e., Class II changes, which will not change form, fit or function, will be replaced on an attrition basis unless directed by an Airworthiness Directive.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the overhaul contract.  If applicable, contractor will provide within the 30-day period a flat rate overhaul price for the new part number to cover the remaining option years.  Superseded parts, which have been removed, and replaced by new part number configurations are to be scrapped at contractor's facility in the presence of a DCMAO inspector or Coast Guard designated COTR.

4.0.  DEFINITIONS.  For the purpose of this contract, the following definitions apply:

4.1.  OVERHAUL:  To restore to original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) minimum functional performance specifications by disassembling, inspection, overhaul, assembly and testing of parts or components in accordance with OEM's current specifications and procedures.

4.2.  REPLACEMENT:  The substitution of a scrapped, consumable item with a new item manufactured or approved by the OEM or an unserviceable item which cannot be overhauled in accordance with OEM specifications shall be replaced with new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Other than new replacement parts will need prior Contracting Officer approval.

4.3.  UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that are required to be replaced during overhaul, are not considered to be unusually damaged.

4.4.  CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in Section B for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for overhaul.

4.5.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.

4.6.  B.E.R. Beyond Economical Overhaul:  Items requiring overhaul to the extent that the total cost to overhaul exceeds 75% of the OEM’s new replacement cost, will be considered B.E.R.

4.7.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting overhaul and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited.

4.8.	QUALIFICATION OF PIECE PARTS:  The aircraft engine, and its components are 
considered “flight safety critical aircraft parts”.  The use of piece parts or components other than OEM or DOD approved parts is prohibited without prior express written approval of the Contracting Officer.

 5.1.1.3.  Cannibalized Components:  Upon receiving components exhibiting cannibalization, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR and discontinue all actions until the Contracting Officer determines to proceed with the overhaul/overhaul.  DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR shall witness the remaining teardown and inspection of the component and shall be responsible for signing and dating the Contractor’s letter of notification.  DCMAO’s or Coast Guard designated COTR’s signature does not infer acceptance, only acknowledges the claim.  The letter of notification and the inspection/teardown report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for disposition.  If overhaul is subsequently authorized, the contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in 5.2.

5.1.1.4.	Unusual Damage:  When components are received and the contractor's inspection
indicates obvious misuse, unusual or severe damage, the contractor shall discontinue all actions until a DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR is notified and personally witnesses the continuance of inspection and tear down.  The DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR will be responsible to sign and date the Contractor's Unusual Damage Claim Request.

5.1.1.4.1.  The contractor shall, within fifteen calendar days from date the DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR witnesses the unusual damage, notify the Contracting Officer that the item is considered unusually damaged and requires an unusual damage evaluation.

 5.1.1.4.3.  Within thirty calendar days of receipt of Unusual Damage Report and proposal, the Contracting Officer will either authorize or deny overhaul or initiate negotiations.  Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.  If it is in the Coast Guard's best interest not to have material overhauled, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with disposition instructions to return the material to the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center.   NOTE:  The contractor is at sole risk if material is overhauled prior to Contracting Officer's approval to commence overhaul.

5.2.	 OVERHAUL:  The Contractor shall make necessary repairs to unserviceable
components to return to a serviceable condition as set forth in accordance with Section 2.0 this PWS.  Replace only those parts found missing or defective.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be reused.

During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

5.3.	ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE TEST:  The contractor shall reassemble all
components upon completion of overhaul and conduct a performance test in accordance with the applicable directive(s) cited in Section 3.0.  The contractor shall record the results of all performance tests and provide this documentation to the government upon request.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01, TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HELIUM LEAK DETECTOR, ROTARY VANE PUMP AND CART.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to: Respond to questions by vendors: 1) Should item#2 (Rotary Vane Pump) be connected by vacuum     manifold to the inlet of item#1 (Leak Detector)? 2) If a vacuum manifold is to be used, should valves be     incorporated to isolate pumping between item #2 (Rotary Vane     Pump) and item #1 (Leak Detector)? Should the valves be     manual or electromagnetic in operation style? Response to Questions 1 and 2:	The Rotary Vane Pump is a      separate item.  It will not be apart of the Leak Detector,     therefore, no valves will be needed.  The government would     like to procure a Leybold D40 BCS Pump or Equivalent, and     this pump should be charged with fomblin oil because it may     be installed where corrosive gases may be present. 3) Should item #2 (Rotary Vane Pump) have a manual motor starter     attached to the pump motor with manual on-off switch? Response:  No.	This pump is intended as a replacement for     existing Leybold D40BCS pumps, already in service in various     systems in Bldg. 30-DDL.  Upon installation, we will hard     wire and connect it to the existing systems.  4) Should item #2 (rotary vane pump) include an attached exhaust     filter to limit exhaust oil mist? Response:  No.	This pump will be installed on an existing system, where the exhaust of the pump will discharge into a scrubber system, therefore, an oil demister is not needed. In addition:   Item #2 (Rotary Vane Pump) should be a Leybold D40BCS or    equivalent, charged with fomblin oil, and fitted for corrosive    service Item #3 (Cart) should accomodate item #1 (Helium Leak Detector)   and facilitate the transport of it from laboratory to    laboratory.
