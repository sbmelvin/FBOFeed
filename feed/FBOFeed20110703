<DESC>3 JULY 2011<br />SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />FTFA 09-1120
<p><br />This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5. The Air Armament Center Operational Contracting Division is seeking to identify sources with a PRIMARY North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 238220 that has proven technical skills (mechanical, plumbing, electrical, &amp; architectural disciplines) and resources to provide timely, accurate, and complete construction for a major HVAC repair/replace project for three buildings (consisting of three floors each) with a critical construction path. These three buildings (851, 852, &amp; 853) house 524 students and any delay will severely impede the mission capability of the end user, NAVSCOLEOD.</p>
<p>The project includes replacement of the two pipe HVAC system with a four pipe system and is an urgent requirement to battle the high humid conditions present in these dormitories that is promoting growth of mold posing a potential life/safety issue. The Government is seeking sources that have the in-house resources, technical expertise and proven record to be able to perform instant ductwork, and hot water pipes and conduit route changes due to unforeseen obstructions encountered during construction to avoid long lead time ordering delays. This project installs temporary equipment, pipe systems and ductwork to keep rooms in the adjacent buildings with a/c during construction due to the limited number of rooms available for displaced residents. Personnel will be residing in the buildings next to the construction, so the Government is seeking sources with capability to both stay on schedule in a tightly phased project and a proven safety record. The logistics of moving personnel around to be able to execute this project on time is a challenging task that requires an experienced contractor. The unavailability of additional living space has placed a stringent requirement that all utilities continue uninterrupted and that only one of the three dormitories can be down and uninhabited at a time. Additionally, the swing space being utilized is on the Eglin demo list furthering the need for an experienced contractor with a proven record of staying on schedule.</p>
<p>Work also included in this project is the replacement of the central plant HVAC equipment located in Building 850. The work includes mechanical, plumbing, electrical and architectural disciplines. This project primarily consists of the removal and replacement of boilers, pumps, fan coil units (FCU), air handler units (AHU), DDC controls, ductwork and insulation, grilles, ceiling tile and grid, HVAC piping and insulation, duct smoke detectors and all heat and smoke detectors for all 4 Buildings. The estimated period of performance for this project is 450 Calendar Days. Due to the complexity of this task, work will be scaled into six phases to support the relocation of several hundred military personnel.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking firms with a PRIMARY NAICS code of 238220 for this acquisition. The government will not award a contract solely on the basis of this Sources Sought Notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any interested parties shall ensure they are registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR). To register in CCR, go to HTTP://www.ccr.gov or call 1-888-227-2423 for assistance.</p>
<p>The sources sought are to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of resources pursuant to FAR Part 10. This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses should include a statement of capabilities and Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) pricing and address how you will meet the Government's needs according to the description in the first three paragraphs, list previous contracts with like requirements of similar scope and magnitude that your company has been awarded, and submit your company's name, address, Point of Contact, Cage Code, telephone number, and Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 238220, small business size standard is $14M. In addition to the size of business, indicate all classes of business that fit your firm: i.e. Small Disadvantaged, Veteran Owned, etc. Responses are limited to three (3) pages.</p>
<p>Your response must be received no later than 10 JULY 2011 1700 CST. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to the synopsis and solicitation. Direct any questions/responses about this requirement, by email only, to Captain Kevin Behymer, Contracting Officer, at kevin.behymer@eglin.af.mil.</p>

The Government will use contractors who have a record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. As price and price-related factors between quoters become closer, past performance evaluation factors will carry a greater weight. Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial, or not-for-profit sources and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one-page introductory matrix listing the quoter and its critical subcontractors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three references. No more than five references will be evaluated.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more than two references shall be for proposed subcontractors. The quoter should include narrative indicating the rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three years from the date of the quotation, and may include active contracts.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the Statement of Work (SOW). Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-related, but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that described in this Synopsis/Solicitation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by quoters. For each reference, provide the following information:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Program Title<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Type of Contract<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Period of Performance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Actual completion date<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and email addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure the problems it finds in the information provided by the quoter, nor to seek clarifications regarding inadequate or incomplete information. The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the quoter.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government intends to award without discussions with quoters (except communications conducted for the purposes of clarification). Consequently, each quote should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offering firm or teaming arrangement is able to submit to the Government. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if they are determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror/Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (APR 2011), with its proposal. This provision can be downloaded from https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html.</p>
<p>(xi) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause: (1) Wage Determination 1997-0303, Revision 14, dated June 15, 201, is applicable to this acquisition. (2) The Contractor shall provide a relocation coordinator to assist during relocation. The Contractor shall provide sufficient labor, supervision, materials, etc., to begin and complete relocation within the time-frames established by the Government. The Contractor's representative shall attend meeting(s), as requested by the Contracting Officer, with participants from CSPL and USHRL, to receive instruction and provide information about the relocation. The Contractor shall participate in an initial walk through to inspect the property to be moved and facilities at the present and new locations in order to become acquainted with conditions existing at all locations. This will ensure that the necessary equipment and labor can be furnished to provide for the orderly, timely, and efficient movement of the property. (3) All Contractor employees must possess a valid picture ID to gain access to the facilities. There will be no exceptions.</p>
<p>(xii) FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses cited in 52.212-5, indicated by the contracting officer as incorporated by reference, are applicable to this acquisition: 52.203-6; 52.204-10; 52.209-06; 52.219-8; 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.222-54; 52.223-18; 52.225-3; 52.225-13; and 52.232-33.</p>
<p>(xiii) The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government. Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty. The contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with its response.</p>
<p>(xiv) Responses are due by 4:00 pm local time, July 28, 2011, at USDA Agricultural Research Service, 950 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605-2720.</p>
