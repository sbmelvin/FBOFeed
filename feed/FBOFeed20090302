<CONTACT>Terry Wilkinson, Contracts Specialist, Phone 2105364109, Email terry.wilkinson@brooks.af.mil
<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: FULL GRAIN SIDE OUT SAGE GREEN LEATHER BOOTS
<p>SUMMARY DESCRIPTION<br />The current sage green boot (PD 77AESG-06-03) is used by the Air Force as a working &amp; field boot; however, the current sage green boots do not hide most stains. The Air Force Uniform Office (AFUO) has received feedback and compiled data on stains that are most frequent for Airmen (see "Functional Concerns" section). As a result, AFUO is seeking samples of industry available, full grain side out leather boots. <br />This is not a solicitation, and no award will be made for this effort at this time. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government holds the right to test any of the submissions. All submissions must be Berry Amendment compliant. Proposed solutions shall be currently available technologies.</p>
<p>FUNCTIONAL CONCERNS<br />Types of stains encountered by the Airmen have a correlation to their functional daily tasks &amp; responsibilities. In Maintenance functions typical stain types include engine exhaust soot, tire break grime, fuel, deicing fluid, hydraulic fuel, mineral vegetable and ester based oils, and liquid oxygen. In Field use Airmen reported sand stains, blood, grass stains, dirt stain, red clay, flare (orange/red), and muddy water as typical. General staining in everyday tasks such as eating and drinking are tomato, coffee, soda and juices.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL INFORMATION<br />AF requests pertinent specification and test data results for each product. Any available Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) sheets should also be forwarded. Since this product will come in close proximity to the skin while in use, proof is required that no potential health issues are posed by the proposed remedy. Solutions should not cause changes in shade.<br />If this fabrication is currently in use please note current applicable industry or military end uses as well as any known positive or negative feedback from current end uses. <br /><br />The Government WILL NOT provide materials.</p>
<p>RESPONSE GUIDANCE<br />Interested parties must submit at least two samples of full grain leather/stain resistant boot and marketing literature if applicable, for potential solutions to the staining problems encountered by Airmen. Include in key points any additional benefits or risks, manufacturing constraints, effect of finishes on specified salient characteristics, any known health concerns, and associated MSDS information. <br />All boxes/packages submitted in response to this solicitation should be clearly marked with the following information: the company name or identifier, the solicitation number, the number of the box per total boxes/packages shipped (such as 1 of 8) and the type of product contained within. <br />Address samples to:</p>
<p>2Lt Ashley Hawkes<br />Air Force Uniform Program<br />1901 10th St., Area B, Bldg 63<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7605</p>
<p>INFORMATION APPROACH<br />When the responses to this RFI are received, they will be evaluated and analyzed by the Government. The information received will be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy and may serve as input to a business case. In all cases pertaining to this RFI, the Government will take absolute care not to present information outside of the Government in a way that clearly identifies individual vendors or products.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION<br />Responses should include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with us.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-D-1000<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p><br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than 13 March 2009.<br />In addition, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates. For advanced planning purposes the conference will be held in Building 1234, Main Conference room at Hill AFB, UT in the West Area. The conference will begin at <strong>0800 MST on 17 March</strong>. Please plan on arriving at the conference location by 0745 to sign-in.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.5) with Alcon Laboratories, Inc., 6201 South Freeway, Fort Worth, TX 76134, as the only responsible source that is capable of providing an Alcon Infiniti System Ozil w/ Videoverlay.  

Specifically, the requirement is for two (2) phacoemulsification cataract extraction units.  The systems shall be capable of performing phacoemulsification as well as anterior vitrectomy during cataract surgery.  The systems shall have linear, burst and fixed phacoemulsification modes as well as cut I/A and I/A cut anterior vitrectomy modes.  The systems shall be capable of torsional phacoemulsification.    The electrical requirements are 120 VAC, 60 Hz. During a phacoemulsification cataract extraction procedure a phacoemulsification handpiece is inserted into the eye and is used to break apart the lens of the eye for extraction.  Traditional handpieces produce ultrasonic pulses that move the probe in and out of the insertion site of the eye, similar to a jackhammer.  This type of movement at the insertion site of the eye can cause posterior capsular tears, a common cause of post-operative morbidity.  It also causes heat to build up at the insertion site due to the friction caused by contact between optical tissue and the pulsating handpiece.  The build up of heat can further damage optical tissue and cause post-operative complications.  The proprietary torsional handpiece provided by Alcon has a curved tip and rotates side to side at ultrasonic speeds.  The rotational movement of the probe and its curved tip allows for decreased movement at the insertion site while still having high ultrasonic energy to break apart the lens.  The use of a torsional handpiece significantly decreases the likelihood of post-operative complications and morbidity.   Alcon Laboratories is the only vendor that can provide a torsional handpiece that meets the Government’s requirement.  

The system shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to solicit proposals with the intent of signing an agreement with an organization having the capability to develop, maintain and coordinate a prime vendor program in accordance with Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, Public Law 102-585, Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.  Section 340B provides that drug manufacturers who sign a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement, as the manufacturers are required to do by Section 1927 (a) of the Social Security Act, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services agree to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs to covered entities that will not exceed the amount determined under a statutory formula (ceiling price).  Section 340B also mandates the establishment of a prime vendor program.  Consistent with this mandate, HRSA has developed a program which consists of both price negotiation and drug distribution for covered entities that elect to participate in the prime vendor program (member entities).  The offeror that submits a technically-acceptable responsive proposal that offers the best value to member entities will be selected as the Prime Vendor.  The Prime Vendor shall operate as an independent entity and not as an agent of the Government.  No Federal funds will be awarded to the Prime Vendor under this Agreement.  The Prime Vendor shall provide, directly or by subcontract, all drug/pharmaceutical items authorized under Section 340B for distribution to all member entities.  The Prime Vendor has the option to offer other catalog items, as appropriate.  In addition, the Prime Vendor shall negotiate sub-ceiling prices for the benefit of the member entities.  HRSA reserves the right not to award an Agreement if it is determined that no organization meets the technical and business criteria enumerated in the HRSA Request for Agreement.  A Request for Agreement HRSA-HSB-PVA-09DM is anticipated to be released within twenty (20) days from release of this notice.  Offerors will have thirty (30) days from release of the Request for Agreement to submit their proposal.  The solicitation will be available at this website (www.fbo.gov) as an attachment to this announcement.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for amendments to this solicitation.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (TPC/NHC) located in Miami, FL, requires annual licensing and support for its satellite imagery ingesting system. The TPC/NHC uses Global Imaging satellite ingesting hardware and operating system. Global Imaging is a provider of remote sensing hardware and software who manufactures the GOES-EAST and GOES-WEST satellite ingest cards currently in operation at the NHC. Its proprietary GOES-EAST Ingest System Software and GOES-WEST Ingest System meet all the requirements needed by TPC/NHC. Another known source for this support would be Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC). However, for the TPC/NHC to switch to another provider, they would have to buy new hardware and then pay for the software support on their systems. Switching to another source would require the repurchasing of both hardware and software, which would not be most advantageous to the Government given the expense already put forth. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12.101 and 13.106(b). The proposed contract action for the GOES-EAST and the GOES-WEST Ingest System Software Support at the TPC/NHC will be a base period beginning March 1, 2009 through February 28, 2010 with two 12-month option periods. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. However, all responses received within 5 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Karen Christian at (816) 274-6952 or sent via email to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide this service. The NAICS code for this action is 541511. The Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUN). A DUN number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for a contractor to provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, transportation, and supervision to renovate the existing HVAC system at the Education Center building at the William Howard Taft National Historic Site. The work consists of, but not limited to, replacement of existing condensing unit, installing electrical heating coil in existing Liebert Unit, rework on electrical/control wiring, control panels and re-programming whole building Direct Digital Control (DDC). The work includes replacement of an existing ten ton single, dual stage compressor air cooled condensing unit with a new ten ton dual circuit (2 compressors) air cooled condensing unit. The existing refrigerant lines and hot gas bypass line will remain and be reused. The hot gas bypass line will be connected to the lead compressor in the new air cooled condensing unit. Replace the existing hot water coil in the existing Liebert unit with a new electric heating coil. Currently the existing hot water coil in the existing Liebert unit serves as a reheat coil for controlling humidity in the Archive room, which means heating could and will be required in the middle of summer to meet humidity and temperature ranges.  By adding the electric heating coil the main boiler could be disconnected from the existing Liebert unit. This will avoid having to start the boiler during the summer months. This would provide maximum equipment efficiencies. The project performance period is 30 days after issuance of the notice to proceed. The NAICS code is 238220.  The small business size standard is $14.0 million. The estimated price range for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. This project is being solicited and awarded in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, Public Law 100-656. Accordingly, it is open to both small and large businesses. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, and wage rates will be posted to the websites http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about March 17, 2009. No hard copies of the solicitation package will be mailed or issued. To receive the solicitation package you must download it from http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

USA Armed Forces Recruiting 
225 E. 16th Street
Denver, CO 80203

This is a notice of intent for the General Services Administration to solicit space for the USA Armed Forces Recruiting (USAF) in Denver, Colorado.  The Government anticipates negotiating a succeeding lease at the existing location (225 E. 16th Street, Denver, CO 80203) which currently provides 23,440 usable square feet of contiguous office and a minimum of 27 reserved parking spaces, 13 of which must be covered parking spaces, for Government vehicles.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Government’s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be located within three blocks of the present leased location.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on February 24, 2009, or sooner.  A lease term of 5-years firm is sought.     

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, October 8, 2008.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent. 

Required:  All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  
Occupancy:  The space is required on or before February 24, 2009.  
Term:  The lease term will be for 5 years firm.  
GSA Contracting Officer: Dan McPherson, 303-236-8000 ext 2359. Owners/Agents:  Any expressions of interest should be directed to Brian L. Wells of CB Richard Ellis, 1225 17th Street Suite 2950, Denver, CO 80202, Phone: 303-628-1706, Fax: 303-628-1751, E-mail:  brian.l.wells@cbre.com.

<DESC>The Government anticipates to award a firm fixed price award to Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum USA, INC, 5700 Mellon Rd, Exporta  PA, 15632-8900. One (1) Cryopump and the associated controller for the BJD 1800 evaporator is required. Only Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum can supply these goods as these systems are being built from an existing and proven drawing package. Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum is the only known approved vendor for the required BJD 1800 cryopump. No manufacturers other than Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum can provide this assembly without being qualified, which represents a substantial duplication of costs that would not likely be recovered through open competition, only Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum and no other source will satisfy agency requirements. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be fully considered by the Agency.

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS); a market survey for information only. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources; please do not request a copy of a solicitation, as one does not exist.
<p>The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group, Brooks City-Base TX is seeking sources for a requirement to acquire coherent, technically consistent, engineering and manufacturing development support that will enhance the survivability of aircrew members through improved performance, maintainability, and availability of the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) family of ejection seat aircraft (A-10, B-1, B-2, F-15, F-16 and F-22) without aircraft modification.</p>
<p>The principal goals of this effort are to develop and qualify modification improvements for the ACES II utilizing ACES 5 technologies that will keep pace with aircraft operational mission requirements, and address aircrew safety issues associated with high-speed/high altitude operating environments. Additionally, this effort will allow for an increase in ejection seat capability to support an expanded anthropometric aircrew range, extended ejection envelope for altitude and speed, and an improved maintainability capability that significantly reduces ejection seat maintenance downtime, resulting in increased aircraft operational availability. A primary goal is to develop improvements for potential retrofit of existing ACES II seats, or incorporation into new production ACES 5 ejection seats, without aircraft modification. Included in this effort will be research on ACES 5 enhancements to reduce neck loads. The respondent will develop, design, and build prototypes test articles that will demonstrate that a field-level modification can be retrofitted to existing ACES ejection seat aircraft without aircraft modification. The respondent shall furnish all plant facilities, labor, equipment, special tools, test equipment, and materials. Government drawings, tooling, and facilities to manufacture these ACES 5 technologies are not currently available. The respondent shall be willing to sell at least ninety percent of the manufacturing data to the Government with unlimited rights</p>
<p>A contract may be issued to cover all engineering, manufacturing, qualification testing on applicable sub-systems, integration, and any necessary development testing associated with improving the operation and maintenance of the ACES family of ejection seats. This will be accomplished by incorporating controllable propulsion subsystems to optimize terrain clearance during the ejection sequence, upgrading ejection seat sequencing and sensing subsystems for safer/faster/more reliable operation, and allowing the ejection seat to be removed from its crew station without the requirement to remove the aircraft hatch, which will significantly increase aircraft availability. Additionally, this contract will address improving the ability to eliminate/mitigate limb flailing during high-speed ejection, and optimizing aircrew accommodation improvements for better access to aircraft controls and improved body position for aircraft operation and ejection. This contract will cover all engineering and manufacturing efforts required in support of trade studies, preliminary designs, final designs, and design verification to determine the merits of the services described above. <br /><br />Therefore, the Government is seeking interested firms to furnish the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. (2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330. (3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide work identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 541330 to be more appropriate as a classification for the work identified above? Please include the rational for your answer. (4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. (5) Provide no more than three (3) references for no more than three (3) of the most recent and relevant contracts performed within the last three (3) years. Include name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of references. Also, provide a brief description of the work performed, and period of performance. Information on contracts must be the same or similar to the nature of this inquiry.</p>
<p>Information submitted will be used for planning purposes. Responses should be directed to Capt Al Belin, 77 AESG/PSK, Contract Manager (email: Alfort.belin@brooks.af.mil) and secondary point of contact Lt Chuck McLeod, 648 AESS/TAA (chuck.mcleod@brooks.af.mil). This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a request for proposal, and in no way commits the Government to an award of a contract. Reimbursement of any cost regarding the preparation of proposals or bids will not be made.</p>

Installation Description:

Fairchild AFB is approximately twelve miles west of Spokane, Washington in the Inland Empire of eastern Washington. Nestled in a high valley between the Cascade Mountains to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east, the base enjoys relatively mild and dry weather virtually year-round.
In 1947, the 92nd Bomb Group arrived at the newly named Spokane Air Force Base and has, under various designations, remained permanently assigned there ever since. In September 1950, after a series of name changes, the Air Force officially designated the installation Fairchild Air Force Base in honor of General Muir S. Fairchild. General Fairchild was a native of Bellingham, Washington who died the previous spring while serving at the Pentagon as the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.
The region enjoys four distinct seasons. Spokane is protected from the damp coastal weather found in Seattle, as well as from severe winter weather because of its location between the Cascade and Rocky mountain ranges. Precipitation amounts to only about 17 inches per year, while the average annual temperature is approximately 47° Fahrenheit.
Fairchild AFB encompasses 4,223 acres of fee land plus an additional 1,318 acres in easements, 2 acres of leased property and 148 acres of permitted/licensed land. Fairchild AFB is also accountable for and maintains records for 19 geographically separated installations. These installations comprise 339 acres of fee lands, 55 acres in easements, 26,203 acres of leased property and 505,570 acres of permitted/licensed land from the Forest Service for the Cusick survival area. Family housing consists of 1,108 units on the main installation and 319 units located on geographically separated installations. Also, 2,199 enlisted personnel can be accommodated in dormitory spaces on the main installation in permanent-party and transient quarters.
Fairchild AFB is second only to the State of Washington as the area’s largest employer. Approximately 7,625 people are employed by the base. Of this total, 4,118 are military personnel, 1,906 are civilian employees and 1,601 are Washington Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel. The base’s average annual payroll exceeds $137 million.

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The Fairchild AFB electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access, as presented in Section J1.12.  The system may include, but is not limited to, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, duct banks, switches, street lighting fixtures, manholes, transformer vaults, meters, and other ancillary fixed equipment.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate.  The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Fairchild AFB Military Family Housing was privatized in FY08. 
Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Emergency Power  Generators, Parking lots and pedestrian pathway lighting fed off the building internal source, offsite locations of Tacoma Creek and Ruby Creek, and Military Family Housing: Command Circle, Ft. Wright Village, Galena Station, NCO Capehart, Officer Capehart.
The Fairchild AFB primary distribution system contains three feeders that run between the North and South Substations (Feeders 1, 2, and 3). Each primary feeder contains a normally open switch that establishes the north-south break point between the north and south feeders. The distribution system is primarily an underground system, with Feeder 1S being the exception.  Feeder 1S consists primarily of overhead distribution, with a limited amount of underground.
The primary distribution system consists of two substations and three primary feeders.  The North Substation is supplied 115 kV power from the Airway Heights Line and the South Substation is supplied 115 kV power from the Sunset-Westside Line. Both lines are owned by Avista Utilities.
The North Substation contains a single 10/12.5 MVA, 115 kV-13.2 kV step-down transformer.  The North Substation transformer supplies the three north side feeders (Feeders 1N, 2N, and 3N) via 1,200 ampere metal clad switchgear.  All north side feeders are underground lines, with limited areas of overhead distribution in housing areas.  The South Substation contains a single 12/14/16 MVA, 115 kV-13.2 kV step-down transformer.  The South Substation transformer supplies the three south side feeders (Feeders 1S, 2S, and 3S) via 1,200 ampere metal clad switchgear.  Feeders 2S and 3S are underground lines and Feeder 1S is the one remaining area of overhead distribution at the base.
The main north-south lines of each feeder contain numerous pad-mounted switchgear and/or load-break junction boxes. The switchgear and junction boxes provide sectionalizing capability for the system. The primary line switchgear is predominately 4-compartment switches rated at 600 amperes, with a small number of FPC switchgear of the same rating.  The switchgear generally contains one or two fused disconnects to supply loop or radial branch circuits.  The junction boxes are primarily units with load-break elbow connectors. 
The system contains one automatic switch for the Hospital branch circuit, Switch S3-080. Switch S3-080 is also the normal north-south break point for Feeder 3. The hospital is normally supplied from Feeder 3S.  If a loss of normal power is detected, the switch automatically aligns the hospital branch circuit to Feeder 3N.
A total of ten primary transformers are located inside three different buildings on Fairchild AFB. The transformers range in size from 100 to 750 kVa. Most of the transformers are located in building 2050, which is located on the Flight Line.

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The Fairchild AFB water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access.  The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, exterior backflow devices, pumps, water treatment facilities, wells, and meters.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. 
Items specifically excluded from the utilities privatization effort are: Fire Protection Systems, Backflow Prevention Devices located inside existing facilities, Lawn Irrigation Systems, and Military Family Housing: Command Circle, Ft. Wright Village, Galena Station, NCO Capehart, Officer Capehart.
The Latah (Hangman) Creek Aquifer, from which Fairchild AFB draws some of its drinking water, is centered on Latah (Hangman) Creek.  The majority of the base’s water supply is provided by the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie (SVRP) Aquifer.  The base's Fort George Wright groundwater wells have a ground elevation of 1,690-1,697 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL) and are fed from both aquifers.  The water must be pumped uphill 744 feet in 11.21 miles of pipeline to the elevation of the main base's “Water Plant” Bldg 2169.
The Fort George Wright Annex water well complex was constructed over a 17-year period beginning in 1943.  The complex is comprised of five wells that are pumped by five electrically-driven pumps.  The wells tap into an underground water flow from both the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer and the Latah (Hangman) Creek Aquifer that extends south of Spokane.  The water pumped from the aquifers is pure enough to drink right out of the well, but to meet health standards; there is an application of chlorine at Geiger Reservoir.
The actual combined output of the Ft. Wright well field is not merely the sum of each pump’s individual output.  Due to backpressure from the other wells on a common discharge pipe, the combined actual pumping capacity is 4,420 gpm when they are all running at the same time.  The water is pumped from the wells through a 16" steel pipe through the inactive Rimrock Booster Station.  Here it passes to a 16" concrete cylinder (CCP) pipeline installed in 1950 and although it has never been replaced, it is in decent condition.  The water continues to the 515,254-gallon Geiger Reservoir, located northeast of Spokane International Airport.  From there, the water is pumped by four pumps (with a combined capacity of 4,100 gpm) to the storage tanks at the main pump house on base (each with a capacity of 464,783 gallons each).
The main pump house (Bldg 2169) is equipped with three electrically-driven pumps (with ratings of 2 ea. @ 2,000 gpm, and 1 ea. @ 1,200 gpm).  The three pumps are used to fill the three storage tanks via the water distribution pipeline grid.  The three pumps can run on generator power.  The total on-base rated pumping capacity is approximately 6,200 gpm (including Well #2).  The water is fluoridated before entering the ground storage tanks.
Located at the extreme southeast corner of Fairchild AFB, the 725-gpm Well #2 pumps water to the water distribution grid and to the elevated storage tanks.  It is a permanent water source which was once utilized in the summer months (prior to 2007) as a seasonal well to meet irrigation water demand.  The well water is chlorinated at the well site.  This well has a 250 kW backup electrical generator to pump water during commercial power outages.
The distribution system consists of 10- and 12-inch main distribution pipelines, with 6- and 8-inch pipelines forming the grid network to serve Fairchild AFB.  There is no tracer wire on pipe installed in the 1950’s.  Although the City of Spokane’s standard is ductile iron, all new and replaced infrastructure piping base-wide is mostly C900 PVC.  The average pipe depth is 4.5’ but may range from 3 to 20 feet in depth.  Leaks in the distribution system occur once every few months from corrosion of the piping material.  Old age is frequently the cause; leaks are repaired as required.  American Leak Detection fixed numerous leaks over several years that have improved the water distribution system making the wells more efficient.  Several valves on-base were tested and replaced in 2006.  All cross-connections within Fairchild AFB have been fitted with backflow prevention devices.
Turf grasses and landscaping require irrigation to survive.  Water used for irrigation constitutes a majority of the base's water consumption during June-August.
Water to White Bluff is completely independent from the water system supplying water to the Main Base due to a 730’-deep well (second well at site is inactive)that supplies the area with potable water.  The site's water is pumped through a 4" line to a 65,000-gallon storage tank.  A hypo chlorinator supplies a diluted solution of bleach to maintain a chlorine residual between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm.  The hypo chlorinator is actuated by the well pump controller.  Water is pumped from the ground storage tank to a pressure system which is made up of a pressure tank, two 35-gpm pumps, and an air compressor.  Normal operating pressure for this system is between 45 and 60 psi.  The pumps and compressor are operated by a mercury control which actuates the pumps to fill the pressure holding tank to a predetermined level which is marked on the sight glass on the end of the tank.  When this level is reached, the pump(s) turn(s) off and the compressor will start pumping air into the tank at a predetermined pressure, then the compressor will shut off.
Clear Lake Recreation Area is also independent from the Main Base distribution.  The existing 340’-deep well pumps to 4 water storage reservoirs.  The well house is adjacent to cabins that serve military and DOD personnel from mid-April through Labor Day.  Restrictions have been imposed due to reducing amount of well water.  A complete renovation of the water system was done for the grand opening of the renovated resort ten years ago.
The Tacoma Creek Command Post has a 72'-deep, 23-gpm drilled well that serves the SERE School staff of three instructors.  The Ruby Creek Command Post has its own 114’-deep, 25-gpm well. Both posts are comprised of new and or recently refurbished infrastructure.
Fairchild AFB does not have federal reserved water rights for their wells.  The wells are not located on public domain land, but are acquired parcels of property.  Federal ownership of the land does not qualify a water source for federal reserved water rights status.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

The Fairchild AFB wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access.  The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, manholes, and lift stations.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system.  
Items specifically excluded from the wastewater system privatization are: All Septic Systems, including Ruby Creek, Tacoma Creek, and White Bluff, Grease Traps, Oil/Water Separators, and Military Family Housing: Command Circle, Ft. Wright Village, Galena Station, NCO Capehart, Officer Capehart.
All sanitary wastewater is collected in the sanitary sewer system.  Wastewater conveyance is mainly through a combination of gravity sewers aided with four lift stations.  It is eventually treated at the City of Spokane Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility located north of Spokane.  Wastewater discharge is monitored by the city for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, cyanide, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, zinc and fats, oil and grease.
Fairchild AFB has a sewage collection system that serves most areas of the base; local septic tanks handle some of the smaller, more remote areas.  The collection system consists of a network of pipes ranging in size from 1.25” to 30” and consists of mainly concrete pipes with some vitrified clay and PVC pipes.   The burial depth of the pipe ranges from three to twenty feet.  All lines merge at the far northeast corner of the base where a single 30- inch concrete pipe carries the discharge to the Spokane regional sewer system for final treatment and disposal. 
Most of the system is 50 years old or more.  Original pipe materials of construction included vitrified clay and concrete.  Later expansions and upgrades have used PVC and have included fiberglass lining of some pipes and manholes.  Overall, there are an estimated 146,000 linear feet of sanitary sewer pipe and 440 manholes in the main base area of Fairchild. The remote areas of Fairchild AFB include White Bluff, Clear Lake, Tacoma Creek, and Ruby Creek.  Wastewater at Clear Lake is partly collected via a septic system, while White Bluff, Tacoma Creek, and Ruby Creek are completely collected via septic systems. All septic systems are excluded from privatization.

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice in an attempt to find companies who can provide epitaxial grown (layer by layer) GaN and AlGaN wafers on sapphire substrates. The wafers shall be designed and grown specifically for developing a highly efficient and wavelength selective (tunable) photodetector devices. The exposed Active Layer must be designed and grown for colloidal quantum dot (QD) deposition (to be performed by NSTec/STL personnel and/or project subcontractor) as the barrier enhancement layer prior to the application of the Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) horizontal layer. The wafers should be of 2 inch diameter for visible blind photodetection and solar blind photodetection, respectively. Specifically, cutoff wavelengths must be in the range of 365-260 nm for the visible blind layers; and 290 to 330 nm for the solar blind layers. The capability to grow active and buffer layers with high aluminum content is required. These layers should be grown with the intent to produce the structure of a Metal Semiconductor Metal (MSM) photodetector as its final device. Therefore, migration-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MEMOCVD) is the required method of growth. This method optimizes the surface migration of Al and Ga adatoms to appropriate site in the material lattice. Metallization capabilities for regularly spaced interdigitated, finger-like structures are also required. Vendor must show definitive capabilities to develop visible blind and solar blind epitaxial layers using MEMOCVD. Materials development capabilities and services must include Migration Enhanced Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MEMOCVDTM). Metallization techniques for MSM photodetectors are required. Professional services shall be provided as subject matter experts on GaN/AlGaN layer growth and GaN/AlGaN photodetector development so that effective communications between NSTec/STL researchers and vendor personnel can provide desired materials characteristics. A report on the characteristics of the wafer(s) provided shall be detailed.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT.  This Notice is not a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers.  The Regional Contracting Office, Fort Richardson, Alaska, intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Corbett Technology Solutions, Inc (CTSI),  4151 Lafayette Center Drive, Suite 700, Chantilly, VA 20151.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price sole source contract to CTSI.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)-only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  CTSI is the only known source that offers the installation and maintenance of existing secure and non-secure VTC equipment to ensure a single Video Tele-Conference Operator can set up and manage simultaneous on both secure and non-secure VTCs from the single existing control booth.  The VTC suite installed by CTSI is an integrated system that consists of proprietary equipment and program coding with existing CTSI warranties.  Having anyone other than CTSI work on this equipment will void the warranty for the VTC system.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Scope:  This requirement includes a secure upgrade to the VTC Satellite Suite and installation of a secure VTC with existing VTC equipment.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334310 and the size standard is 750 employees.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A solicitation will not be issued.  Interested firms may submit their technical capability statement for satisfying this requirement to the email address identified below not later than 2 p.m. Alaska Time, March 9, 2009.  Interested firms should describe how they will ensure that the existing warranties will remain valid. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  The POC for this action is Tammie Adair, tammie.adair@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) Wing, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California intends to award a sole source contract to the incumbent contractor, SCITOR Corporation, 2251 Corporate Park Drive Herndon, VA 20171, for the procurement of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for an additional period of nine (9) months, from 1 April through 31 December 2009. This sole-source award is intended to satisfy the Wing&rsquo;s A&amp;AS requirement until the award of an SE&amp;I contract planned for December 2009. The future SE&amp;I contract will be awarded using full and open competition, with a 5-year period of performance and an expected value of approximately $100M. The successful offeror will provide systems engineering, configuration management, test and evaluation, and software systems engineering analyses and recommendations related to acquiring space systems and the supporting multi-agency, networked ground-based C4. Award of the 9-month sole source contract to the incumbent will avoid adverse conditions caused by sudden loss of knowledge, disruption of critical management processes, and insufficient access to specific engineering insight for effective decision-making and program management. This sole source action will retain the Wing&rsquo;s immediate access to 40+ professional advisors and access to a large number of experienced engineers with active TS/SCI clearances. This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 &ldquo; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&rdquo; While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. The Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees and responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole-source contract to American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&E) for Maintenance of AS&E MicroDose X-ray systems.  This is a follow-on contract to the contract issued to AS&E, Contract Number HDTRA1-06-C-0004.  DTRA intends to negotiate and award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract to AS&E with a base period of one (1) year and four (4) one-year options to maintain highly specialized MicroDose X-ray systems that require specific expertise found only at the manufacturer level of technical knowledge.  Backscatter x-ray is a proprietary technology manufactured only by AS&E.  The MicroDose operates with a 50% lower level of x-ray exposure to the operator than the level associated with other manufacturer’s equipment.  AS&E is the only known source with extensive current and historical knowledge, experience, and expertise to perform this effort.  AS&E technicians are the only repair technicians authorized to work on the MicroDose Backscatter system to maintain certification that systems are operating properly and at a safe x-ray emissions level; thus, DTRA proposes to award this contract to AS&E on a sole-source basis.  This action will be executed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. This is NOT a request for proposal; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses to this notice of intent to award a sole-source contract to AS&E may be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this action at this time based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, Inc. (AOT), 1367 Old State Route 34, Jonesborough, TN, 37659-6315. AFRL/RWMI requires 5000 pounds of tungsten cubes and/or spheres, sintered to a density of greater than 18.4 g/cc military grade tungsten, sized in various dimensions between 1/4 inch and 1 inch cubed/diameter, plus or minus 0.010 inch tolerance. In order for the overall material testing program to have validity and continuity, it is mandatory that the above described test material is the exact same composition as previously tested tungsten, and AOT was the supplier of these previous test materials. Additionally, the material properties of the required material must have the same mechanically strengthened and heat treated processes applied under the same conditions as previously tested materials. If a vendor other than AOT provides the materials, it would require extensive revalidation of materials and strength testing adding extensive costs and program delays of up to one year. However, all interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) which should, if possible, include at least three references of the above materials having been provided to customers for use as preformed fragments in weapons; these will be considered if received by noon central time zone on 16 Mar 09.

PSA is responsible for the investigation and supervision of persons arrested and released into the community pending disposition of their cases in the D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. PSA is committed to honoring the constitutional presumption of innocence and enhancing public safety. Its mission is to 1) formulate recommendations that promote the use of least restrictive nonfinancial pretrial release and 2) provide effective community supervision for defendants to ensure court appearance, promote public safety, and address social issues that contribute to crime.</p>
<p>I. Introduction<br />The PSA Training and Career Development Center is the primary developer of this statement of work. This series of trainings will provide agency employees with the skills needed to use basic and advanced motivational interviewing techniques. Specifically, participants must be introduced to concepts that allow them to use motivational interviewing techniques to assist defendants in obtaining a clearer understanding of the need for change and making a more solid commitment to change a specific behavior.</p>
<p>II. Scope<br />This training is to take place at the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency training facility beginning no later than May 2009. All training should be completed by August 31, 2009. The final dates and exact hours of the training will be determined upon award.<br />Three different training courses on motivational interviewing techniques are needed. These are:<br />&bull;Four one-day classes, i.e. the same one-day class offered four times, that focus on motivational interviewing techniques for brief interactions. The class should include basic motivational interviewing skills and should be tailored toward employees who have brief interactions with defendants, such as Drug Testing Technicians, Program Assistants and Assistant Pretrial Services Officers. Approximately 60 participants will be divided between the four classes. The maximum number of participants will not exceed 75.<br />&bull;Four one-day classes, i.e. the same one-day class offered four times, that focus on using motivational interviewing while conducting criminal justice interviews. This class should be tailored toward Pretrial Services Officers who conduct interviews. It should instruct on how to use motivational interviewing to gather both objective and subjective client information. Approximately 50 participants will be divided between the four classes. The maximum number of participants will not exceed 65. One of the sessions may need to be conducted on a weeknight between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. to accommodate participants who work an evening shift.<br />&bull;Seven four-day classes, i.e. the same four-day class offered seven times, that are tailored toward Pretrial Service Officers who provide defendants with extensive supervision, individual/group treatment, and/or substance abuse assessment. This class must be divided into two training sessions. The first two days should focus on the characteristics of motivational interviewing and how to elicit "change talk" and respond to resistance. The first two-day session should end with participants receiving instruction on how to apply and track new skills learned during the first two-day session. A formal way to document practice must be provided. The second two-day session should include a debriefing of how the participants practiced the new skills and should take place six to eight weeks after the beginning session (to allow participants ample time to practice). This session should focus on how to strengthen defendants' commitment to change. Approximately 150 participants will be divided amongst the seven classes. The maximum number of participants will not exceed 165.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 334516, is to notify contractors that the government is seeking competition of this requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106.

Under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29.  Anyone who deems themselves capable, to provide maintenance/service for the items may do so.  This synopsis is designated for full and open competition for a firm fixed price purchase order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

The Food and Drug Administration intends to purchase a High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 

HPLC Specifications are as follows:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a HPLC system including the pumps, autosampler, and detectors which shall be controlled from one central keyboard and be compatible with the same chromatographic software package. The chromatography software data and control system shall have the capability to control and acquire data from every module of the HPLC system.  There shall be two way feed back of information from the software to the modules to prevent runs being lost and to be able to run programs (such as shut down) automatically.

PUMPS

The pumping system shall be a binary pump system with a precision of 0.1% or better.  The pump must be capable of pumping 0.001 to 10 milliliters per minute with no pump head changes for maximum flexibility.  

DETECTORS

Two detectors will be necessary.  Both photodiode array and scanning fluorescence detectors shall be part of the same chromatographic software system.  The detectors are used to identify a wide range compounds of interest to the FDA. Examples include DEHP, latex accelerants, bisphenol A, and the active ingredients in contact lens solutions.

The diode array shall have a wavelength range of 190-800 nm with one single lamp source with an optical resolution of 1.2 nm. This diode array shall be able to run 8 simultaneous wavelengths in 2D mode with differing bandwidths for maximum sensitivity. The diode array detector shall be capable of continuously scanning the array to provide for spectral information throughout the run and be able to be used for confirmation of peak purity.  The peak purity software shall be able to do full chromatogram scouting automatically and yield a pass/fail result outlining the peak and area questionable.


AUTOSAMPLER

The autosampler requires internal and external needle wash capabilities that eliminates "crossover" contamination. This is required due to the nature of our biological samples and the low levels of analytes.  This shall be in the range of sample carryover to less than 0.1%.

Because the number of projects requires large and small sample sizes, an injection range from 0.1 to 2000 ul using same injection loop is needed. Heat and cooling of sensitive samples are occasionally requires, long run times require stable temperatures for the autosampler (within 0.1oC). 

SOFTWARE/ DATA MANAGEMENT

The chromatographic software must be protected such that a data file, or method, or sample queue can never be overwritten.  The software must have integrated into it the capability to generate reports and calculations such as not to have to use an external spreadsheet or quantitation package such as excel.  All information concerning the methods, chromatograms and conditions must be kept in a database in a stand alone computer.  The interface to the instruments must be graphical in nature and must be customizable by the user to obtain chromatograms suitable for publication.  The software must have pattern matching capability to enable us to compare two or more chromatographic runs and quantitate the differences between them.  Ability to overlay and subtract chromatograms is necessary.  Ability to read Empower Software is necessary as 15 years of data is archived in this program.


EVALUATION FOR AWARD

Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this purchase order to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1.

The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.

 The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as “Flight Critical” and ACMS Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote.  Evidence of other certifications, such as a DOD Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer.   Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis.

Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1000<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p><br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than 13 March 2009.<br />In addition, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates. For advanced planning purposes the conference will be held in Building 1234, Main Conference room at Hill AFB, UT in the West Area. The conference will begin at <strong>0800 MST on 17 March</strong>. Please plan on arriving at the conference location by 0745 to sign-in.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
