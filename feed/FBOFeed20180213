<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333415 with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees.<br /><br />AFRL requires two (2) York Variable Geometry Diffuser (VGD) Retrofit Kits and the incidental installation to two Government owned York Chillers.<br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:<br /><br />Johnson Controls<br />105 Twin Oaks Drive<br />Syracuse, NY 13206<br /><br />The Government has determined that no other source has commercial offerings that can meet this requirement. York is the only brand that manufacturers the VGD Retrofit Kits that require no modification to the existing York Chillers. The York VGD Retrofit kits are able to be directly installed as is, and will communicate properly with the existing electronic hardware and software on the Chillers. Procuring any other brand would require replacement of the existing chiller units. York is represented by Johnson Controls in this geographic location.&nbsp;
<p><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Ashley.Ellinger@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 March 2018.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<DESC>The Nano-Bio Manufacturing Consortium is expected to grow the US-centric innovation ecosystem that will risk reduce material supply (including nanomaterials &amp; biomaterials), processing techniques, and flexible/stretchable device concepts by demonstrating component- and system-level functionality relevant to human-integrated technologies, such as airman-performance monitoring (APM) and augmentation (APA) systems. This public-private partnership should build upon the foundation of research &amp; development excellence that has been established within NBMC since its 2013 inception.<br />It is envisioned that technology development will require teaming between academia and industry in partnership with government researchers as well as with appropriate members of the regulatory and operational DoD communities. A balance between enabling component- and systems-level prototype development is expected to be realized through end-technologies between TRL 3 and TRL 6. It is expected that during the completion of certain NBMC projects, lab and/or field demonstrations will be conducted in partnership with relevant DoD partners to ensure that members of military human performance and/or aeromedical communities can assess the utility of developments and provide iterative feedback with respect to critical path issues.<br />

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be approximately 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Acquisition Services, Atlanta, Georgia, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c) and FAR 13.106-1(b), intends to solicit and negotiate with Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The resultant BPA will be awarded for a five-year ordering period and will include a variety of over 400 laboratory supplies to be used by the Division of Scientific Resources (DSR). The objective of the BPA is to provide DSR efficient ordering, fast turnaround time, and economical prices to CDC laboratories as they respond to public health needs.

This notice is not a request for offers, however, all offers/ responses received within 14 days of this posting will be considered. A determination by the government not to compete this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions relating to this notice should be addressed to Pat Billins, Contracting Officer, at pbillins@cdc.gov.

<DESC>The goal of the Manufacturer Direct Program is to establish an alternative to manual open market purchase activity, re-engineer the business process with automated e-commerce business solution. The objective of this solicitation is to establish a Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with NuVasive for their spinal orthopedic "procedural packages." These "procedural packages" include spinal implants, instrumentation sets, orthobiological products and ancillary accessories (such as bone cement, guide wire, etc.) that are necessary for the orthopedic surgery. <br /><br />There are (3) three delivery methods (Just-In-Time (JIT), Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) and Consignment) utilized to support DLA customers' requirement for orthopedic "procedural packages". Under the JIT delivery method, the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) will call the sales representative when a surgery is scheduled to discuss the case, make a product selection and inform him or her of the surgery date and time. The manufacturer's representative will transport the "procedural package" to the designated site at the scheduled time. The representative may be requested by the MTFs to have in their possession a number of "back-up" components available to the physician during the entire procedure. Under the "DVD" method, MTFs may order product in advance of a scheduled surgery or purchase replacement inventory on an as needed basis. Under this method all items are packaged for shipment to the delivery point cited on the purchase order. Under the "Consignment" method, an MTF have the products that make up the "procedural set" consigned to their facility.
<p>This solicitation also contains an on-site personnel requirement for the contractor to provide advice and guidance to physician's before, during and after implantation of the device at the request of the Medical Treatment Facility. Technical support shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.</p>
<p>Market Research has revealed that there are no other manufacturers or distributors other than NuVasive who can provide DoD hospitals with the complete NuVasive "Procedural Package" (NuVasive spinal implants, use of the instrumentation sets, orthobiological products and the auxiliary products) at the required time for surgery and be available on-site if needed to answer questions on all these products. The NuVasive Sales Representatives are experts on NuVasive's products and are a vital part of helping to ensure that the patient is getting the necessary treatment. Only NuVasive has these capabilities.</p>
<p>NuVasive will have their product line loaded in the DLA Troop Support Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT). All Orders, Order Acknowledgements and Invoice transactions are required to be electronic. Items will be delivered to various Department of Defense (DoD) research centers, hospitals, and clinics, and any federal customer participating in this program.</p>
<p>The term of the contract will be a one-year Base Period and four one-year unilateral Option Periods. This procurement has an estimated value of $8,000,000.00 for the Base Period, $8,054,400.00 for the first option period, $8,109,169.92 for the second option period, $8,164,312.28 for the third option period, and $8,219,829.60 for the fourth option period, for a total of approximately $40,547,711.80 over the five-year life of the procurement. The contract maximum is $126,711,599.37 over the 5-year life of the contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey which seeks to identify and draw participation from the private sector manufacturers of antenna towers to support various FAA airport activities and upgrades across the CONUS.

The buyer seeks responses from qualified antenna tower manufacturers of all sorts, in any part of the US that is able to manufacture antenna towers to our specifications and deliver them to various locations across the country.

The buyer anticipates buying in various lot sizes at different times of the year to coincide with USG needs. Sellers would be asked to identify costs of variously sized towers, identify lead times to manufacture, identify if they are selling from previously produced stock (potential emergency stocks), commit to self-managed transportation (including unloading) of the goods to possibly remote locations in the contiguous United States.

Positive responses at best prices to the USG would allow the buyer to consider other contract types including blanket orders for the successful offeror.

Specific product definitions would be provided for given sites (tower height main variable).
NAICS code(s) being considered at this time are: 237130, (other TBD)

We expect to offer an initial lot of firm fixed-price buys to retire immediate demands while contract language is being negotiated with successful bidders. These will be independent efforts. We will expect price breaks dependent upon released quantities (1-10, 11-20, etc.). Multiple sources could potentially be considered should logistic considerations call for it (regions of the country).

Responses should provide Marketing or Management POC with authority to commit their respective companies insofar as pricing, contracts and work scope is required.

Alternate or, out-of-the-box proposals are welcomed.
Time is of the essence in placing these immediate demands so, it would behoove you to begin your pricing strategy sessions now.

<SUBJECT>R--Accelerated Competitiveness Enterprises (ACE) RFP
<SOLNBR>72029418R00002
<CONTACT>Zakariya, Nevine
<DESC>Dear Prospective Offerors:
 
 
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about March 9, 2018 for an anticipated five-year Cost Plus Fixed-Fee term Contract for the USAID/WBG Accelerated Competitiveness for Enterprises (ACE) Project.

The overall goal of the Project is to increase global competitiveness as well as private sector-led economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza through providing problem-solving services to Palestinian firms in order to enable them to expand sales and exports and generate increased investment.  These increases will result in the creation of new jobs, which will increase the incomes of people currently unemployed or underemployed, including women and youth, contributing thereby to a growing, inclusive economy. 

The anticipated Project will apply a market-driven approach starting with the market  operationally, buyers  and work backwards to help firms solve the constraints that stand in the way of their selling more and increasing sales and profitability.  

The Project consists of two primary components as follows: 

1.	Component I will focus on transactional support where the Contractors technical assistance will help firms take the actions required to address the client firms business problems with business solutions and ultimately increase sales, exports, investment, productivity, and jobs.  

2.	Component II will work with firms as well as private sector growth-focused entities, such as trade and business organizations or government institutions, to focus on removing systemic constraints (policy or institutional) that prevent sales transactions from taking place. 

Prospective Offerors are advised that issuance of the RFP solicitation and award of a contract are subject to the availability of funds, as certain procedural and legislative requirements for obligating funds have not yet been met.

The place of performance under the anticipated contract is the West Bank and Gaza.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice:
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Maintenance and Repairs of the North Jetty feature of the Federal Navigation Project (FNP) in Scituate Harbor, Scituate, MA. This project is set-aside for small business. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is expected to range from $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The work of this project consists of repairing several sections of the North Jetty at Scituate Harbor. The nose of the north jetty (i.e. seaward end) along with other smaller areas along the structure were damaged during Winter Storm Juno in 2015 and subsequent storms. Approximately 2,000 tons of new armor stone will be required to make repairs to the nose section of the jetty. The new armor stones will vary in size from 6-8 tons. The work includes dismantling, removing, stockpiling, reworking and reinstalling existing armor stone as well as acquiring and installing new armor in the jetty repair areas. The repaired areas must be properly interlocked and be within specified design tolerances. The new armor stones will be required to be delivered via waterborne plant and placed upon the shore behind the State spur jetty for further placement into the structure. No over the road transport of stones will be allowed. Due to significant eelgrass beds adjacent to the structure in the interior of the harbor, stone placement work will be required to be performed from the top of the structure.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about March 1, 2018. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests for hard copies will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Elizabeth.k.glasgow@usace.army.mil .</p>

Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
  Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.
Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 
Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.  

Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 
The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.
The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.

The awarded A-E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside general contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A-E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A-E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF-330 in the  Find a Form  block and click on search.

<p>Description of Program Requirement:</p>
<p>1. Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training and Instrumentation System (PM CTIS) is seeking to procure one each Mobile Access Node (MAN) for the National Training Center (NTC) and for the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC). The Government may increase the quantity of MANs up to six total. The MAN will integrate into the Range Communication System (RCS), which supports the Combat Training Centers (CTC) by providing a commercial cellular network and devices for tracking vehicles and soldiers in support of After Action Reporting (AAR) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities during training exercises.</p>
<p>2. The MAN is a subsystem of the RCS which allows the CTCs to supplement coverage in the training areas to ensure more accurate tracking of entities by transferring the signal from the RCS commercial network and repeating that signal in areas with poor or no coverage. This capability is essential in ensuring that the CTCs get the most out of the tracking and situational awareness capabilities of the RCS. This effort will require the design, development, integration, testing, documentation, and delivery of a MAN to include system level testing with RCS at JRTC located at Fort Polk, LA and National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, CA. The MAN shall include trailers with self-powered mobile nodes with environmental protection and power generation.</p>
<p>3. Mobile nodes shall be:</p>
<p>a. Deployable in an operational configuration by two persons (excluding transit time) in less than 4 hours.</p>
<p>b. Recoverable by two persons, to include logoff, power off, disassembly, and preparation for transportation, in less than 5 hours.</p>
<p>c. Equipped with anti-collision measures visible to low flying aircraft.</p>
<p>d. Self-contained including diesel or propane power generation.</p>
<p>e. Capable of providing 2-hour automatic battery backup power. Engagement of the backup battery shall send an alarm to the network administrator workstation with location and time.</p>
<p>f. Capable of storing sufficient fuel that permits continuous operation for at least 48 hours.</p>
<p>g. Capable of performing off of 110/220 VAC-50/60 Hz commercially available power when provided at the training site. AC power connection shall be through a commercial standard connector.</p>
<p>h. Equipped with a local alarm that signals tampering; precludes theft; and sends an alarm message to the Range Monitoring and Control Subsystem (RMCS) upon activation.</p>
<p>4. Trailers shall be capable of extensive off road use in rough terrain at the CTCs and be capable of being towed by High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles or commercial trucks, i.e., Ford 250 or Chevrolet 2600.</p>
<p>5. Towers shall be:</p>
<p>a. Configured with a manual/auto-erect guyless mast that can operate in 70 mph winds at full height with equipment installed.</p>
<p>b. Capable of reaching 110 feet measured from the ground to the pinnacle.</p>
<p>c. Equipped with a lightning arrester system.</p>
<p>d. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular AC 150/5345-43 compliant red L-810 obstruction lighting system for nighttime operations installed in accordance with Chapter 5 of the FAA Advisory Circular AC 70/7460-1, if towers are 50 feet or greater in height.</p>
<p>6. The MAN shall have already been tested and met the following MIL Standards.<br />&nbsp;

Statement of Work-Ussing Chamber

Background: Essential hypertension (eHTN) affects millions of adults in the U.S. and contributes to end organ damage including kidney failure.  The epidemic of eHTN is, in part, related to environmental changes, and in particular, the high sodium (Na) and cholesterol (chol) diets consumed in the U.S.  The link between Na consumption and eHTN is established; however, the relationship between chol and eHTN is not well understood.  Chronic, long-term hypercholesterolemia leads to arteriolosclerosis and diminished vascular compliance predisposing to eHTN; however, recent evidence suggests that acute, short-term chol ingestion augments renal Na avidity to raise blood pressure (BP). Hypercholesterolemia promotes incorporation of chol into lipid rafts (LRs) of the plasma membrane (PM) which raises PM viscosity and induces diseases such as diabetes (by suppressing insulin secretion) and diabetic nephropathy. The contribution of chol to organ dysfunction is underscored by the  observation that chol chelation by cyclodextrin improved insulin secretion and diabetic nephropathy while treatment with statins had no effect.  We hypothesize that chol incorporation into the lipid rafts and plasma membrane of the kidney collecting leads to enhanced epithelial sodium channel dependent trans epithelial sodium transport which contributes to the development of hypertension.

Objective:  We seek to purchase an Ussing chamber, equipment that permits the measurement of trans epithelial currents, in order to test whether cholesterol incorporation into collecting duct epithelium enhances trans epithelial sodium transport.


Place of Performance:  Northport VAMC, Building 62.

Travel:  Not Applicable 
 
Special Material Requirements:  Not Applicable
 
Any Other  Requirements unique to the solicitation:   Not Applicable
 
Scope of Tasks/Product Specifications:  Our goal is to test whether cholesterol incorporation into the plasma membrane enhances trans epithelial Na transport in cortical collecting duct cells. The system we request is simpler to use and easier to generate data.   See below for the details.
The chamber stand and chamber system use the Easy mount approach   provides a simple slot for a specific slider to easily be inserted into or removed from the chamber very easily and quickly.  Each chamber is independent therefore if one has a small leak due to improper mounting you will only need to manage the single chamber not the entire system.  The Individual chamber cradle approach lends itself to vert fast and easy cleanup.

The voltage current clamp is the only type that has a gain and fluid resistance adjustment (Optigain adjustment) on the main panel to allow easy adjustment from very small surface area 0.002 cm2   to large surface area 1.26 cm2 with a quick and easy click of a dial switch. 

Physiologic Instruments software (Acquire and Analyze) has many advantages as well:


Acquire & Analyze is designed specifically for trans epithelial electrophysiology. It is not intended to be used as a general purpose instrument. Its custom features permit concomitant recording of voltage and current from up to 8 voltage/current clamp channels, and it imposes a command signal across the epithelium to calculate and plot trans epithelial resistance in real time. This feature alone is a significant benefit over the PowerLab, which in the case of Powerlab requires an individual to post process using manual input to calculate TEER or conductance at each time of interest -- very time consuming! Acquire and Analyze data acquisition is easy to initiate and requires only a selection of a new file name and few clicks of  Ok for setup. Data collection rate is easily selected from 3 user defined icons (slow, medium and fast -- typically once every 1, 10 or 20 sec, respectively) by a simple click on the icon before or even during an experiment. If one selects 10 sec, the trans epithelial voltage, current and resistance or conductance on each tissue are measured and stored once every 10 s. This yields very small data files relative to the files created when using PowerLab.  This difference is due to Powerlabs continuously sampling at a high rate to capture all pulses imposed across the epithelium. Thus, to minimize memory requirements A&A files are small and contain only pertinent information, while PowerLab file are large and contain a lot of redundant information between the relevant data points for these kinds of experiments.
