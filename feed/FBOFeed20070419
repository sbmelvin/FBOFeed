<SOLNBR>07Y013042

<CONTACT>Allison Ford, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0101, Fax 301-443-3849, Email aford@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management has a requirement for the Office of  Planning , Research and Evaluation, Administration for Children and Families.  The purpose of the project is to test a range of promising strategies to promote self-sufficiency and reduce welfare utilization.

This project represents the next step in a series of evaluation of demonstrations designed to promote employment and self-sufficiency among economically disadvantaged families, including those receiving or at risk of receiving welfare benefits.  This project will evaluate multiple employment-focused strategies that build on previous approaches and are adapted to the current federal, state, and local policy environment.  Approaches of particular interest include employment services that involve couples together, those that serve families with barriers such as a disability or a history of substance abuse, employment-focused diversion programs, self-employment programs, strategies involving employers, strategies to increase employment retention and those designed to promote career advancement.  However, other approaches may also be evaluated.  Such programs and services will be operating in the context of the requirements set forth in Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which changed the work participation rate calculation among other changes in the TANF program.  The goal of the evaluation is to increase our knowledge about the empirical effectiveness of programs utilizing varied strategies aimed at helping low-income families sustain employment and advance to positions that enable self-sufficiency.

The research for this study will be based on random assignment, experimental evaluation designs and will include impact and implementation evaluations in up to six sites.  ACF expects that the interventions evaluated may range from short-term, narrowly focused activities to more comprehensive longer-term services, and that each intervention site will enroll a sample sufficiently large to allow detection of policy relevant effects.  For some interventions, the evaluation may require enrollment of approximately 2,000 individuals or couples into the research sample, divided between treatment and control groups.  The sample sizes may vary based on the intervention design, the population focus, and the results of power analyses for specific interventions and outcomes.

At a minimum, the evaluation shall address the following research questions:

1. What are the types and packages of services or policy approaches provided under each intervention?  What are the characteristics of the populations served?  How are services for the target population implemented?  How do services for the treatment group compare to the services available to the control group?  What are the issues and challenges associated with implementing and operating the service packages and policy approaches studied?  

2. What are the net impacts of selected approaches under the project on outcomes including but not limited to employment rates, earnings, wage rates, family income, employment retention, and public assistance receipt? 

3.  Do some programs work better for some subgroups than others?  How do program impacts vary by sub-group or by treatment type?

4. What are the costs of employment programs in the study? Do estimates of benefits of providing services or implementing policies outweigh the costs of these initiatives?

ACF expects that the sites selected for this demonstration may vary considerably.  These broad research questions are expected to be consistent across sites and programs; however, more refined questions shall be developed to reflect the specific interventions included in the study. 

The proposed procurement is full and open.  It is anticipated that a Cost-Plus Award–Fee Contract will be awarded for a period of 7-years for the Core Study.  The contract will include optional tasks that if exercised may extend contract performance up to a period of 10 years.  Solicitation 07Y013042 will be issued 15 days after publication of this notice.  Prospective offerors will be given an opportunity to submit questions prior to submission of a proposal.  Details and instructions for submission of questions prior to submission of a proposal will be provided in the RFP.  The RFP and any amendments to the RFP will be posted on FEDBizOpps.  No telephone, fax or e-mail requests for the RFP package will be accepted.

TRAA has developed and will be conducting four regional workshops that will involve high level members of the towing and recovery industry which will also include law enforcement in each State.  Additionally, TRAA designed and produced fact folders that will contain information about the TRAA national driver certification program and license agreement.  TRAA developed workshop materials, presentation handouts and the certification contracts in towing.  Because TRAA is the only national professional association for the industry which represents several other towing businesses across the country they are considered the only source who can provide the services.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is May 2, 2007.

<CONTACT>Linda King, Contracting Officer, Phone 405-739-5453, Fax 405-739-4452, Email Linda.King@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER FA8107-06-R-0002, 327 Aircraft Sustainment Group Contracting Division, TINKER AFB, OK 73145-3032, for additional information contact Contracting Officer, Linda King/327 ACSG/PK/(405)739-5453. SOLE SOURCE Item Description:  The 498th Missile Sustainment Group at Tinker AFB, OK will execute a Product Improvement Program (PIP) to repackage the Programmable Intelligent Multi-Purpose Fuze (PIMPF).  The current production PIMPF is 5 inches in diameter.  The Advanced Unitary Penetrator (AUP-3(M)) warhead carried by the AGM-86D Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) has a 3-inch diameter fuze well.  Therefore, the objective of the PIP will be to repackage the 5-inch production PIMPF into a 3-inch form factor to fit into the current AUP-3(M) fuze well, without functional changes to the current production 5-inch fuze performance and safe & arming functionality.  This fuze will replace the Hard Target Smart Fuze (HTSF) currently in use in the AUP-3(M) penetrator installed in the AGM-86D.  The HTSF has design life issues that will affect future serviceability.  This effort will cover full US qualification, verification testing, and production of the 3-inch version of the PIMPF.  This requirement will be a 3 year firm fixed price contract.  A Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) is anticipated and approximate NTE solicitation issue date will be 17 Sep 06.  The anticipated award date will be 19 Oct 06.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  Written procedure will be used for this solicitation.  Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-5135. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.  Note: Faxed solicitation requests can be submitted to 327 ACSG/PK, Tinker AFB OK 73145-3032, FAX NUMBER (405)734-4452. See Note (s) 22, 26.

<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing Launch Services, Inc. for Launch Services in support of the AEHF-2, MUOS-1, NROL-27 and NROL-49 missions.  The four (4) missions will be added to the existing Lockheed Martin and Boeing EELV Launch Services contracts.  These four (4) Launch Services will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required).  The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  The Government may elect not to award any of the launch services (described above) as a result of these solicitations.  A J&A was approved based upon FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) which states, “When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.”  FAR 6-301(a)(2)(iii) goes on to state, “Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in … (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.”  And FAR 6.302-3(a)(i) states, “Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization.”  The J&A permits Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to Lockheed Martin and Boeing, subject to the Competition in Contracting Act. Any other interested parties (or new entrants) must, at a minimum before being considered a responsible prospective contractor for any EELV launch services contracts, (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal, (2) have successfully demonstrated two (2) missions (intermediate or larger) that insert payloads into their intended orbits, (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) and presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3, and (4) successfully complete a two-part evaluation, at their own expense, per the attached new entrant capability criteria.  Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, including small business firms, are encouraged to submit a statement of capability(limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to:  LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Judy Parnock, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business.  Prior EELV experience has shown that the time period for a new entrant to demonstrate it is a responsible prospective contractor  may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the missions identified in this NOCA.  Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and attached new entrant capability criteria to initiate activity towards demonstrating responsibility.  Other than the responsibility requirements to be met by contractors before award of these specific launch services, no formal qualification requirements have been established, but the government reserves the right to do so at a later date. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award any contracts on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. See note 22.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICIATION BEING POSTED AS PRESOLICIATION IN ORDER TO UPLOAD ATTACHMENTS. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement to acquire the services of a service provider to facilitate FEMA in obtaining authenticated applicant identity verification services.  The service provider provides these services through an ISAAC/NEMIS interface across an Internet connection.  Call centers, provided by FEMA, at any disaster nationally, are the locations from which the information is generated for the service provider to create the digital queries.  FEMA is also interested in validating the identity, home ownership, and records pertaining to tangible property for validation of the residency, the associated recovery claims, and returning a victim the value of property that can be assessed and associated with the victim/applicant identification.  This contract will also include monitoring methods that are of the highest industry standard thereby allowing the Government reporting information that demonstrates the process in reducing the potential for fraud claims and is not creating unnecessary transactions for identity scoring.  A desired outcome is to increase the performance measurement standards for transactional accuracy in identification authentication at call centers and with on-line requests for services.  The anticipated contract will be a commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type. This requirement will be procured on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>This requirement was previously publicized under GSA Solicitation GS07F06HRR0004.  This is a first-time requirement for a pre-event contract that provides national coverage for ground ambulance, air ambulance and paratransit services in response to a disaster, act of terrorism or other public health emergency.  FEMA will divide the nation (48 contiguous states) into four (4) geographic zones: Gulf Coast, Atlantic Coast, Western U.S., and Central U.S. Contracts will be put into place for each zone; however, the solicitations will not be conducted simultaneously. Subject solicitation will be issued for Zone 1 (Gulf Coast -- TX, LA, MS, AL, GA, and FL) and Zone 2 (Atlantic Coast -- SC, NC, VA, WV, MD, DE, PA, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH, and ME). The NAICS code for this procurement is 621910 – Ambulance Services, with a size standard of $6.5 Million.

The contractor(s) will not use ambulance service providers within the affected state(s) of the Incident of National Significance.  The contractor(s) should refrain from subcontracting with ambulance service providers that are committed under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) agreements since it is anticipated that these ambulances will be contracted for and deployed by the state(s) in which the disaster is occurring through EMAC.

The Government anticipates awarding multiple IDIQ contracts for each service and each geographic zone, which will be defined in the solicitation.  Task orders will be issued with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable CLINs.  Period of performance will be a 12-month base year from date of award with four 12-month option periods. 

The issue date for this solicitation is estimated to be on or about 30 April 2007.  Response date above is estimated.  Actual proposal due date will be specified in the solicitation and may be earlier or later than 30 May 2007.

All inquiries must be in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer, Judy Stevens, at agcro@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center East, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, NC has submitted a requirement for a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), Qty: 1 each.  Brown & Sharpe is the proprietary US supplier of the Brown & Sharpe Global Performance Model 9128, Coordinate Measuring Machine.  The Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE), Cherry Point, recently procured a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) from Brown & Sharpe, under Contract M00146-04-P-9053.  The requested equipment (CMM) will be used to measure the cases and rotors of military gas turbine engine utilized for match grinding of T58 and T64 rotors and compressors cases for military gas turbine engines.  The CMM will enable the FRCE to increase its capacity for measuring components prior to compressor match grinding; and as such must be 100% compatible when integrated with an existing CMM and Danobat grinders for match grinding.  An existing CMM, under Contract M00146-04-P-9053, Brown & Sharpe Global Performance Model 9128, is already integrated with match grinders and performing this function.  The same model CMM will allow FRCE to standardize CMM’s and application program PCDMIS Version 3.2, and ensure 100% compatibility without communication errors.  This sole source procurement will allow only one manufacturer to be held fully responsible for all performance characteristics throughout the acceptance test process and the following warranty period.  Therefore, sole source procurement of this new equipment from Brown & Sharpe will ensure 100% compatibility when integrated with the existing CMM and Danobat grinders for match grinding.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The solicitation will be posted electronically at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 02 May 2007 with proposals due approximately 04 June 2007.  This requirement is contingent upon receiving FY 07 funds.  The NAICS Code is 334513 with a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), Air Resources Laboratory(ARL) has a requirement to continue development of previously initiated project in which the archived meteorological data fields from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) recently compiled at the NOAA National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were converted and reformatted for the purpose of re-examining several past tracer experiments conducted by ARL. Current tasking is to modify the previously developed model evaluation methods into a consistent set of procedures that can be applied to any of the ARL experimental data sets. A generic evaluation procedure would consist of the input parameters required to run the dispersion model, the appropriate meteorological data, software to compare the model results with the experimental measured data, and related visualization tools.  Complete documentation (step-by-step instructions) is required. Also, structure the directories and file naming conventions on the ARL web server and transfer all the data, computation, and analysis programs to their appropriate locations. Develop the appropriate HTML formatted web pages to link the internal data structure, model, and statistical results to the common web page. Test and insure all procedures are running correctly.  This tasking is expected to require approximately 420 man-hours and $15000.00.  This is a total small Business set aside and offers are encouraged to be submitted electronically to don.thompson@noaa .gov by COB of the response date noted in this announcement.

Please use the following address for any correspondence:  Office of Acquisitions, OLAO, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard , Room 6E01, MSC 7540, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7540.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with MedStar Research Institute (MRI) for a five-year cost reimbursement research contract to provide continuing clinical research support services studying aging-related diseases in addition to the expansion of ongoing longitudinal studies under the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)/Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) umbrella.  The purpose of the clinical services is to provide care for NIA IRP research subjects who visit a ward in Harbor Hospital dedicated to NIA IRP patients.  These subjects participate in NIA IRP clinical research initiatives (mostly related to age and age-associated diseases such as endocrinology, cardiology, clinical pharmacology, neurology, immunology/infectious diseases, genetics, and oncology).  Since 2000, MRI has been able to meet the numerous and diverse requirements of the NIA IRP clinical program, and has successfully provided clinical support to accommodate the evolving nature of the clinical research.  The statutory authority applicable to this solicitation is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302.1.  No other firm can reasonably supply the needed services.  The NIA IRP needs the following services: --- Immediate access to at least 23,000 rentable square feet of contiguous space, in a JCAHO-accredited hospital that is located within 15 minutes of the Gerontology Research Center, which is located in east Baltimore, MD; --- Ability to acquire (or if necessary to renovate) space to continue  a clinical research center which will shall contain at least 10 inpatient beds; examination and testing rooms for 9,000 to 12,500 patient visits annually; research pharmacy space; clinical laboratory space; nourishment space for food service to patients; inpatient monitoring space for nursing staff; space for medical records and equipment including structural capacity to hold two Lektrievers, all of which must be secure; and sufficient office and ancillary space for staff physicians, research fellows, nurses, research pharmacist, technicians, and clerical personnel; ---Admission of patients whose illness, as result of participation in an approved NIA IRP research protocol, warrants acute patient care as well as access to other services at the hospital such as diagnostic imaging services, pathology and laboratory support, nuclear medicine, medical consultation services, and blood bank services; housekeeping, janitorial, food service, and security services.  This organization has the prerequisite knowledge, experience, and facilities for the continuation of this proposed acquisition by reason of its preliminary and current work on this project.  The resulting contract will be for a one-year base period, commencing approximately February 2008 with four additional one-year options.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  If, however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities and facilities which would enable them to perform this project, they may submit a proposal which will be considered by NIH.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division (CCD) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to Colorado State University (CSU), Natural Resources Ecology Laboratory of Fort Collins, CO under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this Purchase Order is to initiate several analyses in preparation for developing estimates of changes in agricultural soil organic carbon (C) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions for the "Inventory of US Greenhouse Gases and  Sinks: 1990-2006".   These analyses include (1) assessing managed lands in the US, (2) adjusting the National Resource Inventory (NRI) forest area estimates to match those in the Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), (3) evaluating the latest NRI data for use in the 1990-2006 GHG Inventory estimates for  soil C and N2O and 4) preparing quick-turnaround analyses on issues related to agricultural or Land-Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) sources/sinks.   It has been determined that due to the unique technical expertise and experience relating to this requirement, CSU is the only source capable of  satisfying the Government's requirement.  The CSU team has developed extensive expertise in utilizing the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology for estimating soil carbon stocks in the US and remains the only group of scientists who have successfully applied the IPCC  methodology to the existing US activity data for generation of national soil carbon estimates. The Century/Daycent model, which will be used to estimate both soil carbon and nitrous oxide flux from soils, was developed by a team at the CSU.  No other organization exists that can operate this model  for this purpose, and no other model can be used to perform this work.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690.    NO SOLICITATIONS OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any organization that believes it is capable of  meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov. A determination  not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist via e-mail at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov

The Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development of Tanzania, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to support the Ministry of Infrastructure Development in developing a National ICT Backbone Network including a detailed study of projected traffic to be carried over the Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul networks to and from the submarine cables. The National ICT backbone network will increase direct regional communications capacity and global connectivity at a much lower price than current satellite circuits.

Tanzania does not have a national long distance network that connects its major population centers to smaller towns, rural areas, or national border points with its neighbors.  To alleviate this problem, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development is planning to implement a Tanzania National ICT Backbone Network. The backbone network will also form the foundation for a Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul network by providing connectivity and international links from the proposed submarine cable landing station in Dar es Salaam to regional backhaul networks with neighboring countries on Tanzania?s border. 

As the Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development will oversee the Feasibility Study. The Ministry will be supported by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Agency (TCRA), which will take the lead in developing the regulatory framework for the project, in particular ensuring open access, a fair and competitive pricing environment, and interconnection guidelines for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone.

The Terms of Reference for the Grant include the following tasks:

Task 1:  Conduct a Requirement Analysis of the Tanzania National ICT Backbone and Interconnection Points to Regional Backhaul Networks
Task 2:  Market Analysis and Traffic Study Specifications
Task 3: Develop Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone
Task 4:  Business and Financial Model 
Task 5:  Regulatory Framework 
Task 6:  Development Impact Assessment 
Task 7:  Environmental Impact Assessment 
Task 8:  Assistance with Project Financing 
Task 9:  Prepare Procurement Documents
Task 10: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $550,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Burkina Faso: National ICT Backbone Network Feasibility Study.  The Grantee, the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF), acting through le Ministere des Postes et des Technologies de l?Information et de la Communication (Ministry of Posts and ICT), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to implement a National ICT Backbone Network.  The Ministry of Posts and ICT is responsible for the development and implementation of the ICT policy.  In addition, the Ministry is responsible for the postal service.  

The feasibility study will focus on assessing the technical, legal and financial viability of implementing the National ICT Backbone Network in Burkina Faso that will ultimately connect it with neighboring countries.  Burkina Faso is a landlocked country bordered by Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Cote D?Ivoire. Several of these countries could serve as connection points to undersea fiber optic cable (i.e. Benin, Ghana); others could utilize Burkina Faso as an access point to those cables (e.g. Niger, Mali); and several could provide for regional connectivity (e.g. Togo). 

Specifically, the Terms of Reference for this project include:

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with National Association for Area Agencies on Aging (N4A), 1730 Rhode Island Ave, NW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20035 for Community-Based Enrollment Campaign in Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and Extra Help Applications. The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements. The period of performance is estimated to be 12 months from date of award with no option periods. 
 

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to provide community-based organizations (CBOs) support to assist people with limited incomes and resources and on Medicare to apply for the subsidy available through the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and to enroll in Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D).

If the Government does not provide flexible, user friendly, optimal access to applications and enrollment for persons with LIS: (1) it will not meet the legislative intent nor mandate under PL 108-173 and (2) persons with LIS will not have access to the help they need with prescription drug costs subsidy. As learned through the initial Part D Enrollment period, people with limited incomes have gone to their local CBO to obtain assistance for federal and state programs. The CBOs located within the n4a national infrastructure will enhance the ability of CMS and SSA to meet their Congressional mandate of enrolling people with LISR and in the prescription drug coverage.  These agencies are the local, trusted source of information for older people and their caregivers.  Through the N4A mobilization of their network, the work of the community-based organizations as they are approached by the LIA population and their caregivers will be consistent with the CMS, SSA and congressional messages.  


The Government knows only of one capable source, The National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (N4A).The N4A has an existing, nationwide infrastructure that allows the organization to reach Medicare beneficiaries at the grassroots level efficiently through its membership of 655 area agencies on aging and 238 Native American Tribes.  Through their area plans and their planning and service areas, area agencies on aging reach the entire geographic area of the country.  The N4A shall collaborate with a broad-based network of national and local partners that were created during the successful initial MMA open-enrollment period to meet the goals of the current contract. The following tasks shall be performed: 1) Screening for persons with low income and limited resources and completing and  submitting applications for extra help with their prescription drug costs, potential eligibility for Medicare Prescription Drug coverage and inform beneficiaries of the appropriate combination of federal and state programs for which they may apply to maximize coverage. 2) Linking to the SSA web site to assist persons with LIS applications and provide e-forms and/or on-line enrollment. 3) Screen and facilitate application for other key federal and state benefits for which people with Medicare may be eligible. 4) Providing consistent messages on the Medicare preventive health services. 


Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as articulated above. Any other potential source will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement:


1) Direct relationship with the established nationwide infrastructure of area agencies on aging and their service provider contractors;


2) Direct relationship with the Title VI Native American Aging Programs;


3) Experience and proven success in partnering with other national organizations and their local programs; 


4) Established communications tools such as list serves and web programs to provide instant communications across the nation to area agencies on aging;


5) In-depth knowledge of Medicare, Medicaid and the Low-income subsidy;


6) Experience in helping area agencies on aging and their service provider contractors improve their capacity to better serve and represent older persons and persons with disabilities through information, education, training, and technical assistance; 


7) Experience in facilitating cooperative relationships among the aging services provider network, other public agencies, and private sector organizations to develop an accessible and comprehensive long term care system; and


8) Capacity to quickly identify and provide support to local community organizations to provide one-on-one personalized assistance to hard to reach Medicare beneficiaries from low-density rural areas to high density urban areas and minority and limited English speaking populations. 


Any capability statement would have to successfully demonstrate that the source possesses ALL of the above capabilities to be considered a likely alternate source. Capability statements should be submitted by 10 a.m. Eastern Time on May 21, 2007 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.

The contractor shall provide services to design and construct the project to replace general passenger and freight elevators in accordance with the Statement of Work to be included in the solicitation.  The solicitation is to be issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238990.  This size standard is $13.0 Million per year.  This information is only used for classification purposes in the representation and certification portion of the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  To register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in your CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in contest of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions, and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.  Anticipated issue date is May 7, 2007 and anticipated date for receipt of offer is June 6, 2007.  A site visit will be conducted after issuance of the solicitation.  All prospective offerors are responsible to visit FedBizOpps website frequently to obtain any amendments or other information pertaining to this solicitation.  Contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract award.  Contractors may access the CCR at http:www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>O Wayne Koger, 256-955-3947
<DESC>The Department of Defense requires expansion of the C-130 Functional Wing Tip Tanks Demonstration. The Government intends to award this effort to Engineering and Professional Services, Inc. (EPS) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. EPS and its sub-contractors are currently performing the C-130 Functional Wing Tip Tanks Demonstration. Both the current demonstration and the instant added effort utilize data and technology that is proprietary to EPS or its subcontractors.  The Go vernment has determined that award of this effort, which is synergistic with prior and ongoing efforts for similar technology demonstrations, to any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delay in implementing the requirement. The period of performance is two months, beginning not later than completion of the current C-130 Functional Tip Tanks Demonstration effort in MAY07 under existing Contract W9113M-04-C-0028, to which the instant effort will be added by mod ification.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDCM-AK/Koger. This notice  of intent is not a request for proposal from any source other than EPS; however, all proposals received will be considered by the Government.  The Government point of contact for this action is O. Wayne Koger at 256-955-3947 or wayne.koger@smdc.army.mil.

<SOLNBR>W9113M-07-R-0006
<RESPDATE>060407
<ARCHDATE>08032007
<CONTACT>Melissa D Mitchell, 256-955-3699
<DESC>This is an amendment to the previous Synopsis for W9113M-07-R-0006 that was published on 2 April 2007.  * Indicates paragraphs that have been changed or added. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is the Armys premier integrator of space and missile defense capabilities and, as such, has been directed to deliver assigned Army capabilities across the  full spectrum of warfare from concept to warfighter.   In support of air, space, and missile defense, the USASMDC/ARSTRAT executes a requirement to fulfill advisory and assistance services under the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contracts ( SETAC) program.  The contractor will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and Other Government Agencies related to air, space , and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The SETAC scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to have ten (10) functional areas:  (1) Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning; (2) Technology Development, System De velopment, Assessment, and Validation; (3) Threat Estimation/Projections; (4) Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimation; (5) Modeling, Simulation and Interfacing; (6) Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; (7) Production and Fie lding Support; (8) Homeland Defense and Homeland Security; (9) Warfighter Support; and 10) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear. *The original Synopsis for W9113M-07-R-0006 was issued on 2 April 2007.  The synopsis included the following statement The government reserves the right to adjust the reservations based on the outcome of the Sources Sought Validation.   A Sources Sought Validation for this acquisition was issued on 15 March 2007 with responses due to the Government on 4 April 2007.  As a result of the Sources Sought Validation, this acquisition will be a total small business set-aside. All awards will set-aside for small business with 2 Reserved for Woman-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1 Reserved for 8(a) Business; and 3 Reserved for Small Business concerns.  In the event that an 8(a), WOSB, or SDVO award cannot be made,  an additional award will be added to the Small Business reservation. All small businesses will be considered for each of the small business reservation categories that apply to their company and the small business concern reservations. *The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small busin ess members of the team.  Further information regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125).   This small business set-aside acquisition will result in multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor ca tegories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.   The period of performance for the resultant acquisition will be a five (5)-year Basic contract and there will be an option provision for the possibility of five (5) one-year extensions to the basic period of performance.  The Government is planning to incl ude five (5) one-year options in the event that the statutory language preventing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) contracts from exceeding five years is revised within the basic contract period of performance. It is anticipated that the requirement s will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict o f interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC contract. To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technolo gy areas of the contractors actual performance.	 The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710/1000 employees.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The expected release date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 20 Apri l 2007.  The RFP and any other documents/information will be posted and updated on the USASMDC SETAC07 website http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/SETAC07.html.   *This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  In order to be considered for award IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-2 (8/96), Security Requirements, the Contractor shall comp ly with the security regulations and procedures set forth in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Guide, included in the solicitation and resultant contract.   NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.    Questions or correspondence should be directed to Ms. Melissa Mitchell, Contracting Officer, via email melissa.mitchell@smdc.army.mil or via fax (256) 955-4240.  All correspondence should reference SETAC07.

<DESC>GSA has a requirement for Environmental Advisory Services as part of ongoing project tasks from a variety of locations within its 08 Region. To fulfill this requirement, GSA intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Pacific Western Technologies, Inc., in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and the statutory authority provided under 41 USC 253 (c) (1), which is being incorporated in this acquisition effort due to:

1) Only one responsible/capable provider has been identified
2) Services are deemed to be available only from the original source (Follow-up Contract)
3) Substantial duplication of cost to the government is not expected to be recovered through competition
4) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements will be expected if contracted to a less experienced contractor

Only the current source can meet the needs of the project and provide the assistance needed to management the clean-up efforts without the government incurring in delays or a break in services and the associated costs of training a new contractor.     

Thus, sole source procedures and under contracting by negotiation (FAR Part 15) will be used for this procurement effort. Consequently, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received within the fifteen days (15) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit information. A determination by the Government not to consider any submitted proposal based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, the information received could be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future which can be beneficial to the government.

The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) § 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC § 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, OR
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.

Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assigned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).  When there is a requirement for their facility type, each District product line team will scope, negotiate, and award a  task order to deliver the required facilities to the Program Office assigned to manage the overall project. The District product line team will assist with the administration of the task order to include design reviews, submittals, and modifications.  The  design/build contractor for each product line will be responsible for maintaining current documents and incorporating into future task orders changes in army criteria as well as, modification, and clarification identified in ongoing task orders.  The team  will be responsible for keeping up with the current standards and criteria for their facility type(s). SCOPE OF WORK: The contract includes the design and construction of Aircraft Maintenance Hangars at various installations within the Southwestern Region.  This contract will include all management, supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to provide complete and functional Aircraft Maintenance Hangers primarily for rotary-wing aircraft.  Areas shall be provided for maintenance, parts and tool storage, administration, aviation (flying) operations, and all support equipment and facilities.  Each  facility shall be similar to commercial aircraft hangers.  Task orders under this contract may include only design and construction of primary facilities (i.e. vertical construction) or they may also include site work, including parking, service drives, s ite grading and drainage, sidewalks, and outdoor aircraft washrack pads.  Where only vertical construction is required, utility design will be required up to the connection point of site utilities (i.e. water meter, sanitary sewer cleanout(s), gas meter, e tc.).  The contractor must coordinate with the Land Development Engineer or local utility providers that are responsible for all other utility design and installation.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ENM has identified the NIKSUN as a key component of the Department’s Network Monitoring Infrastructure both domestic and abroad.  The equipment listed above is required to enhance the existing Department of State’s enterprise network monitoring efforts based on existing NIKSUN NetVcr’s Bureau wide.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s Network Monitoring system. The Network Appliance Storage System has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

<SOLNBR>DTFAAC-07-R-00013
<RESPDATE>051607
<CONTACT>Holly Crothers, (405) 954-8667
<DESC>The contractor is to provide initial and recurrent ground school, simulator and flight training to commercial/instrument pilot standards for FAA inspectors/pilots in the Bell Helicopter 222/230 aircraft.  The training hours specified in the price schedule are minimums.  If the contractor's FAA approved training program contains less time than the specified hours, the contractor shall supplement their approved program with additional ground school/flight training as necessary to meet the solicitation requirements.  The contractor may, within the limits of their approved program, delete company specific training such as employee/customer relations, filling out company forms, or other items not related to the completion of the FAA type rating or proficiency check and substitute additional solicitation required training. When responding to this solicitation, the contractor is required to submit a copy of their FAA approved training program, along with proposed supplemental additions/changes.  The copy of the approved program submitted must include a course syllabus, including proposed additions/changes, in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the minimum hourly requirements of the solicitation. Training of FAA pilot/inspectors is not to be conducted between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m., including flight  pre and post briefings.  A maximum of four hours flight instruction per day or eight hours of ground school per day per inspector class is permitted. To maintain continuity between flight training sessions, the contractor is requested to minimize the switching of flight instructors between sessions. FAA personnel do not ordinarily operate the aircraft in which they are rated on a regular basis.  Therefore, it is necessary that they receive the most complete review possible when attending recurrent training.  If the contractor's approved program allows for a partial review of systems and procedures during successive recurrent training periods, it is required that the contractor supplement their approved program to achieve a complete review for FAA pilot/inspectors during each recurrent course.   FAA personnel are usually performing other job functions prior to assignment to training and normally do not have time to devote to pre-course study.  Additionally, due to circumstances beyond the control  of the FAA or the pilot/inspector, a pilot/inspector may be assigned to training with short notice.  If the contractor's approved program requires pre-course study prior to the trainee's arrival at the contractor's training facility, the contractor is required to supplement their approved course to allow for required pre-course study to be accomplished at the contractor's facility after the pilot/inspector's arrival.  Such ground instruction must either be classroom or computer based training in accordance with the General Training Requirements of the solicitation.

As the designer and builder of this system, Smithgall is the only company qualified to provide the necessary technical support.  The solicitation will be available no earlier than 23 April 2007.
The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

     TRICARE Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5,  a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Specimen Containers/Collectors. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
    The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Collectors/Containers. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $72,732. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937)257-9075  before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Heartland Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.


D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation. All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.
 Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be non-clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  
Specific MTF’s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert like one to five rating scale. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Heartland Region. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be disqualified from RIA award consideration.
Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  
 

1.	Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoter’s information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) at Patuxent River, MD is seeking potential sources capable of providing a complete end-to-end test system for airborne data link systems and a portable surface terminal capable of receiving Common Data Link (CDL) downlinks from tactical reconnaissance aircraft.  While the airborne data link systems for the Advanced Tactical Reconnaissance System (ATARS) and the Shared Airborne Reconnaissance Pod (SHARP) systems are capable of performing built- in- test (BIT), a more complete end-to-end test is needed to ensure data link performance is 100 percent prior to sending the pod to the aircraft for mission upload.  A portable surface terminal that can be set up and taken down quickly is needed when the squadron is not deployed.  The Airborne Data Link Test / Terminal System shall consist of a test station and Surface Terminal Equipment.  The test station shall contain a computer running Microsoft Windows XP, a Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) Airborne configured CDL Interface Box (Airborne Common Data Link Interface Box (CIB)), a SDL Ground configured CDL Interface Box (Ground CIB), a high resolution computer screen, and an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  The test station computer must contain at a minimum Microsoft Windows XP, SDL Simulator or Analyzer/Router (SOAR) software to control the Airborne and Ground CIBs, Space Dynamics Laboratory Vantage Screener Software, L-3 Comm-West SHARP Airborne Terminal Equipment Graphical User Interface (GUI) software, L-3 Comm-West ATARS Airborne Terminal Equipment GUI software, GUI software to control the Surface Terminal Equipment.  The test station shall be capable of uploading SHARP or ATARS test data via the SDL airborne CIB to the high rate input channels of the Airborne Terminal Equipment under test.  The associated Airborne Terminal Equipment GUI shall be used to run BIT, monitor Airborne Terminal Equipment parameters, and command the Airborne Terminal Equipment to transmit the test data.  The Surface Terminal Equipment shall be capable of receiving full 70W RF from the Airborne Terminal Equipment via RF cable.  The test station shall connect to Surface Terminal Equipment data output channels via the SDL ground CIB and process that data with the SDL Vantage screener.  The test station shall contain other tools that can automatically compare the uploaded test data with the received test data to provide information on image frame counts, CDL packet counts, and error data.

The Surface Terminal Equipment shall be a CDL surface terminal capable of acquiring a full-duplex link with SHARP and ATARS Airborne Terminal Equipment.  Consideration should also be given to capabilities of receiving low rate TCDL systems including systems that transmit video (e.g. a ROVER III type capability).

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Sandia Corp. (DOE Contractor), Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800 MS: 0115, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>63 -- TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY Trace Detection Technology License
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy’s physical security needs, is looking for one or more companies to engage in commercialization of Sandia’s portable MicroHound™ system.  This portable chemical detection technology is especially applicable to the detection of explosives and narcotics.  Sandia developed the MicroHound™ system to be light-weight, swift, sensitive, accurate, and easy to use.  Over time, Sandia has continued to incorporate new technologies as they have become available so the system is state of the art and Sandia expects to continue enhancing its capabilities.

It is expected that successful partners will license Sandia’s existing technology and will work with Sandia to improve and optimize the MicroHound™ system for various markets (i.e., first responders, explosives, narcotics, toxic industrial chemicals or TICs, and etc.).  Because of this expectation, potential partners must document their ability to move similar products to market and demonstrate they have the resources and expertise to design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional trace detection systems.  Sandia also expects successful partners to commercialize the entire MicroHound™ system and not to focus primarily on individual components.

Sandia will give preference to commercial system integrators with experience in trace detection of explosives and narcotics, and companies with successful product offerings.  Sandia anticipates granting one or more licenses, up to and including exclusive rights, to qualified partners.  Sandia licenses typically include up-front fees, royalties, annual minimums, and performance milestones.  Rights are available to several issued patents, patents pending, and copyrighted works related to the MicroHound™ system. 

The MicroHound™ system is handheld and combines, in a single platform, small chemical sensors with large-volume sampling and preconcentration to detect low levels of chemicals.  In particular, patented, leading edge technologies enhance the MicroHound™ system’s ability to collect and identify explosives and narcotics.  As an integrated package, the MicroHound™ system operates in either of two modes: non-contact vapor mode or swipe mode.  In vapor mode, the sampling unit “puffs” the item being inspected and draws in a large volume of air, concentrating heavy organic compounds from the air stream onto a filter.  In swipe mode, the operator swipes a suspicious object’s surface with a filter and places the filter into the MicroHound™ system for analysis.  

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Kathy Gaither by May 11, 2007 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0115. Fax (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm will successfully bring the MicroHound™ system to market.  This is not a federal government procurement and therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia’s selection process.

<SUBJECT>R -- Private Collection Agency Small Business Conference
<DESC>The Department of Education (ED), Federal Student Aid (FSA) invites small business debt collection agencies to attend a conference on small business opportunities under FSA's debt collection contracts.

The ED Private Collection Agency (PCA) Small Business Conference will be held on May 22, 2007 from 8:30 am CDT to about 5:00 on CDT at the following location:

St. Louis Airport Marriott
http://marriott.com/hotels/travel/stlap-st-louis-airport-marriott/
10700 Pear Tree Lane
St Louis, MO 63134
314-423-9700 or toll free:  877-264-8771

Interested parties should register for the PCA Small Business Conference on ED's PCA website at http://www.pca.ed.gov/conference.html.  Please register for the conference by May 15, 2007.  The hall is designed to seat 100.  We reserve the right to give priority to representatives of small businesses.

Lodging should be booked directly with the hotel.  You do not need to mention the conference.  There are no special room rates for the PCA Small Business Conference.

Topics covered at the PCA Small Business Conference will include:

1 - Overview of FSA debt collection requirements
2 - Performance-based/competitive aspects of ED contracts
3 - Subcontracting opportunities
     a - What prime contractors are seeking
     b - Finding your niche
     c - How to approach prime contractors
4 - Requisites for success on the ED contract
5 - The ED contracting process & schedule for new awards in 2008
6 - How to get on GSA Schedule 520-4.

The conference will include presentations by Federal officials and panel discussions with representatives from contractors and subcontractors.

Please direct all other questions and inquiries to pca2008@ed.gov.

This is not a solicitation for proposals and is for informational and planning purposes only. Proposals are not requested at this time and will not be considered. A determination by the Government on how or if to proceed with this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government based on the Government's needs and requirements.  

Questions & Answers

1.  Q.  Is it worth my trouble and expense to attend the conference?

A.  Maybe.  For those who are unable to attend the conference, ED will post presentation slides and other materials from the conference on its http://www.pca.ed.gov website.  ED has two possible opportunities for small business PCAs-subcontracting and prime contracts with ED.  Neither route is easy, although subcontracting may be a better choice for smaller PCAs.  You may also wish to attend to learn how to obtain a General Services Administration (GSA) 520-4, Debt Collection, contract, since you must have this GSA schedule contract to compete for an ED contract.

Subcontracting-Federal contractors are required to pursue goals for subcontracting to small businesses.  Opportunities exist for small businesses that can show they can help one of ED's large business PCAs perform better.  The conference will help you learn more about ED's requirements and where you may be able to help a large business improve its performance by subcontracting with your PCA.  You will hear from existing ED subcontractors and contractors and may have a chance to meet some of them.  ED does not require subcontractors to hold a GSA schedule contract.

Prime contracts-ED plans to conduct the next competition for award of prime contracts in 2008 and will include a set-aside for small business concerns.  Succeeding as a prime contractor can take substantial resources.  The ED contracts are the big leagues of debt collection.  If you are trying to break into student loan debt collection, you may want to work your way up through the minor leagues.  Other student loan debt collection opportunities include schools, States or Guaranty Agencies.  Subcontracting with an existing ED Contractor may be another way to develop talent and resources.

In the next contract competition, ED will be looking for the very best small businesses with proven records of outperforming most other collection agencies on work similar to ED's.  The ED contracts can be both challenging and unforgiving.  ED contractors compete against each other for accounts and bonuses.  If you are awarded an ED small business task order in 2008, you will be competing against the very best small business collection agencies in the country.  If you cannot perform at a level commensurate with the other small business contractors, you will receive few accounts and less revenue.

That said, successful performers thrive under the ED contract.  So, if you are among the best performing small business debt collection agencies--especially if you have experience collecting student loans--then absolutely you should be interested in attending the ED Small Business PCA Conference and seeking an award in the next ED PCA contract competition.  Please join us at the conference!

2.  Q.  What is a definition of a "small business?"

A. "Small business concern" and other terms are defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.001.  http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/current/html/Subpart%2019_1.html#wp1101805

Essentially, the FAR defines a small business as a U.S. business entity, including any affiliates, that is:

- Organized for profit,
- Independently owned and operated,
- Not dominant in the designated field of operation (i.e., debt collection, NAICS Code 561440),
- Qualified under the size standard established by the Small Business Administration for that field.

3.  Q.  What is the small business size standard for debt collection?

A.  SBA has set the small business size standard for the debt collection industry (NAICS Code 561440) at $6.5 million per year in "annual receipts." FAR 19.101 defines "annual receipts" as annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. For further information about SBA size standards, please see http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/index.html. 

4.  Q.  Where can I get more information about the current ED debt collection contracts?

All the documents available from ED's 2004 PCA award competition are available on the web at http://www.pca.ed.gov/archive/index.html.  Documents of particular interest include:

- Request for proposals http://www.pca.ed.gov/library/RFTOP.6-23-04.doc
- Statement of Work http://www.pca.ed.gov/library/PCA.SOW.6-23-2004.doc
- Sample task order http://www.pca.ed.gov/library/Sample%202004%20Small%20Biz%20PCA%20Task%20Order.doc 

Documents and guidance related to performance of the current PCA contracts may be found at http://www.fsacollections.ed.gov/contractors/pca2004/index.html. 

5.  Q. How can we get a copy of the winning proposals for ED's debt collection contracts?

A.  Copies of the winning proposals are not available from the Federal Government.  The FAR prohibits release of a proposal unless it is incorporated into the contract.  ED did not incorporate proposals into the PCA contracts or task orders.

<SUBJECT>--DRAFT PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE ARMED FORCES INSTITUTE OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
<DESC>DRAFT PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT- ARMED FORCES INSTITUTE OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE 1.  Background:  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is establishing the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM) dedicated to repairing battlefield injuries through the use of regenerative medicine. Regenerative me dicine is a promising field that has already achieved early success in the regeneration of several tissues and organs for repair or replacement. Regenerative medicine encompasses many novel approaches for the treatment of damaged tissues and organs by usin g therapies that prompt the body to autonomously regenerate, and by using the patients own cells on biodegradable biomaterials for the creation of engineered tissues or organs for therapy.  These innovations are possible because of several key advances, i ncluding the development of systems that can reliably nurture cells as they grow and divide, the discovery of growth factors that foster cell proliferation in vitro, and fabrication of biomaterial scaffolds for tissue generation in three-dimensions. 2.  Sponsors Concept for the AFIRM:  The epidemiology of combat injury is well defined and presents many opportunities for the application of regenerative medicine to improve clinical outcomes after traumatic injury.  The AFIRM will be a collaborative ins titution comprised of the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (ISR) and a non-governmental organization to address these opportunities.  The sponsor anticipates that the non-governmental organization will be comprised of a management entity and several research institutions aligned as a consortium or similar partnership.  It is expected that the clinical applications of this regenerative medicine effort will be conducted at the ISR and/or at the research institutions on military patients and civilian pat ients with similar traumatic injuries.  The AFIRM will be managed by the non-governmental organization with input and coordination from the Combat Casualty Care Research Area Director at Ft. Detrick, MD, acting as the sponsor, and the ISR.  The ISR has its  own independent funding stream separate from the funding set aside for this effort. The AFIRM will stress the following: a.	Most near term payoff for the service member b.	Service member wound focus c.	Scientific excellence and utilization of technologies at the forefront of regenerative medicine d.	Strategic implementation of research (innovative methods for translation of research efforts into clinical practice) 3.  Special Relationship.  The AFIRM shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsor, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsor, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the AFIRM may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of  interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the AFIRM for customers other than the sponsor (USAMRMC) may be performed only with the explicit permission of the sponsor.  The sponsor will appoint an Executive Agent to represent the interests of the sponsor to the AFIRM on a day-to-day basis.  The sponsor will also appoint an Executive Oversight Board, which will receive the annual, in-person, Report of the Institute.       The nature of the mission of the AFIRM requires that the AFIRM operate in a strategic relationship with its sponsor and users. This strategic relationship shall have the following characteristics and be governed as follows: a.	The AFIRM and its sponsor commit to a stable and long-term relationship. b.	The AFIRM is granted access to information beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, including medical intelligence data and program planning informat ion. c.	The AFIRM bears a special responsibility to avoid actual and perceived conflicts of interest, and the AFIRM accepts stringent restrictions on its scope, method of operations and the kinds of efforts it can undertake either for its sponsor or for other u sers. d. AFIRM work.  The AFIRM may only perform work as defined in its core statement and in accordance with the following guidelines: (1) The sponsor must approve all work. (2) Work may only be accepted from the sponsor and other entities approved by the sponsor.   e. Non-AFIRM work performed by member, parent and affiliate organizations.   (1) Non-AFIRM work shall not undermine the independence, objectivity, or credibility of the AFIRM by posing an actual or perceived conflict of interest, nor shall it detract from the performance of AFIRM work. (2) Non-AFIRM work shall not be acquired by taking unfair advantage of the parent institutions operation of the AFIRM or of information that is available only through the AFIRM. 4.  Research objectives.  Therapies are being sought for the following rehabilitation, reconstruction, problems resulting from battlefield trauma with clearly defined clinical implementation (e.g. clinical trial, evidence based change in clinical practice)  of one or more technologies within five years: a. Compartment syndrome  therapies for repair of sequelae b. Functional limb and digit salvage, ,reconstruction, regeneration, or transplantation i.	Regenerating large osseous defects ii.	Nerve repair iii.	Regrowing functional muscles and tendons c.  Facial reconstruction d.  Healing without scarring e.  Burn repair (regeneration or replacement of skin) 5. Funding.  The funding level for the AFIRM is at least $6 million per year.  Congressional supplements and work for other entities approved by the sponsor may bring AFIRM funding up to $30 million per year.  The most likely funding range will be $10 mill ion to $15 million per year.  The non-governmental organization managing the AFIRM must be able to effectively and meaningfully execute all AFIRM funding in support of its research objectives.  The sponsor envisions that the non-governmental organization m anaging the AFIRM will establish flexible relationships with members, partners, and collaborators to advance the research objectives while responding to varying funding levels.   6.  Contract vehicle.  The contracting vehicle will be a Cooperative Agreement which will allow full collaboration between the ISR and the non-governmental organization and will be for a five year period with the potential for renewal after the five years based on performance.

EVALUATION PROCESS The sponsor intends to utilize a Source Selection Board comprised of experts in the fields of research and management to review proposals and make a source selection recommendation to the Grants Officer.  The Grants Officer will be the final authority for source selection.      Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria below.  Criteria 1 is of greatest importance, followed by criteria 2.  Criteria 3 and 4 are of equal importance and of greater value than 5 and 6.  Criteria 5 and 6 are of equal importance (1 is greater than 2  is greater than 3,4 is greater than 5 is greater than 6).  Proposals will be evaluated using a color coded ranking process.  These color codes are listed here in order of importance: 	Blue  Exceptional, proposal/section exceeds requirements as stated in RFP 	Green  Adequate, proposal/section meets requirements as stated in RFP 	Yellow  Deficient, proposal/section meets some of the requirements as stated in the RFP and potentially can be made Green or Blue with some additional material 	Red  Not acceptable, proposal/section does not meet requirements as stated in the RFP Source selection will be conducted using a four step process.   1.  Initial screening.  The Grants Officer and the chair of the Source Selection Board will screen all proposals to see if they meet the minimum requirements of the Program Announcement.  Those proposals not meeting the minimum requirements will not be eva luated, and those offerors will be notified immediately.   2.  Written proposal evaluation.  Those proposals meeting the minimum requirements of the Program Announcement will be evaluated, rated, and ranked using the criteria in this section.  Those proposals not among the most highly ranked will be eliminated, an d those offerors will be notified immediately.   3.  The Source Selection Board and the Grants Officer will conduct a site visit at one or more of the facilities of each of the most highly ranked offerors.  The site visits will have two purposes.  First, the Source Selection Board will review the facilit ies to gain a more in-depth perspective of each offerors capabilities.  Second, the Source Selection Board and the Grants Officer will conduct discussions with each offeror to gain a greater understanding of all aspects of the offerors proposal.   4.  At the conclusion of site visits/discussions, each remaining offeror will be permitted  to make final revisions to its proposal.  Final revisions will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board, which will make a recommendation to the Grants Officer. Evaluation Criteria 1.	Technical Research Plan a.

Please consider the following questions and provide your response.  To be of greatest value, your response should be submitted not later than 4 May 2007.  Please contain your comment s to 10 pages or less.  Electronic submissions only, please via ASFI/FedBizOps or e-mail to christopher.gloyd@det.amedd.army.mil.       1.  Your comments are invited on the Sponsors Concept of the AFIRM.  Is this an effective way to organize and execute this vital initiative?   2.  Your comments are invited on the special relationship envisioned between the USAMRMC and the organization that will manage the AFIRM.  The Armys objective is to have control and collaboration to a greater extent that that which exists normally in a co operative agreement.  Our notional concept is to employ a sponsorship model, using a sponsorship agreement, executive agent, and executive oversight board.  Is there a better way to accomplish the Armys objectives? Is this process too restrictive? 3.  Your comments are invited on the research objectives.  Are they defined well enough to develop a comprehensive proposal? 4.  Your comments are invited on the Armys expectations with respect to the execution of varying funding levels.  What problems does this present for the organization managing the AFIRM and how might those problems be addressed? 5.  Your comments are invited on the appropriateness of a cooperative agreement as the vehicle of choice to execute the AFIRM.  Would a contract be better?  If so, why? 6.  Your comments are invited on the proposal submission instructions and evaluation process.  Are these instructions clear?  Are they fair?  Are they designed to produce the desired result?  Can they be improved?

USAMITC Video Network Center (VNC) is currently reviewing options for replacing and expanding the existing Avaya Audio Bridge. This bridge has 96 ports and is connected to a private PBX type ISDN switch with PRIs. The  Audio Bridge is located at Fort Sam Houston, TX. In the current network environment, the Avaya Audio Bridge connects to a private ISDN (H.320) network and FTS2001, DVSG and commercial for local and international calling. The Audio Bridge presently connects through Madge/Teleos 200 s eries equipment for routing over these networks.  The present network configuration may or may not remain in place should the government decide to replace the existing Audio Bridge. 		3.1.2.  The present PBX network, into which the Audio Bridging is presently integrated, is comprised of a combination of NET.com Promina 800 and 400 series backbone multiplexers with Prime-switch ISDN 4ESS switching.  This PBX uses a 4 to 23 digit dialin g plan. Connected to the Promina network are Madge/Teleos Access switches which perform local number switching at sites located throughout the MEDCOM global enterprise network. 		3.1.3.  All or part of the present configuration may be reused. 		3.1.4.  The current Avaya Audio Bridge is used in conjunction with various other devices to support the VNCs mission of providing Audio and Video support for the Army MEDCOM world wide. 		3.1.5.  VNC is currently using Avayas S7000 Client Reservation Server (CRS) and Booking and Scheduling (B&S) front end to schedule and control conferences. This software is no longer compliant with DoD computer standards and can not be upgraded to meet compliance. This is proprietary software built to schedule conferences on the Avaya S7000 as well as control active conferences.  This database also maintains a list of Points of Contact (POCs), site location, organization and equipment information.  Contr ol software allows for ad hoc changes to pending/active conferences (add or delete, drop or redial, mute or unmute sites). 	3.2.  This RFI will be used for the following purposes: 		3.2.1.  Developing recommended implementation procedures for replacing the Audio Bridge used within the MEDCOM Enterprise. 		3.2.2.  Certifying audio applications and devices for compatibility with MEDCOMs existing Audio and Video Network Infrastructure.  		3.2.3.  Refining requirements to perform a technical refresh of the existing Audio Bridge. 		3.2.4.  Developing a strategy to enable the VNC to provide enterprise audio and video bridging services to the MEDCOM. 	3.3.  Deliverables. 		3.3.1.  Development of an Implementation Package. 			3.3.1.1.  Managers Planning Guide. This would include developing appropriate usage guidelines; typical life-cycle costs guidelines; resource planning guidelines; and guidelines for the identification of the key decisions to be made and their associated risk vs. needs analysis. 			3.3.1.2.  Installation planning guidelines. Sample project plan and schedule template that shows all the key tasks/considerations that must be accounted for as a part of a typical installation.     			3.3.1.3.  Installation checklist.  Acts as a quick check off for ensuring that all the key tasks have been accounted for.  This would include the checks necessary to verify that common implementation problems have been avoided. 		3.4.1.  Operational environment. The operational environment for the Audio Bridge solution will be in a Data Center environment.    		3.4.2.  Infrastructure h ardware Requirements. Infrastructure to support the Audio Bridge will be provided by the government, such as network connects to service providers, power, and environmental. 		3.4.3.  Audio Bridge solution security. Provide documentation on options available for the control interface to the system.  Include a description of the different interface options such as IP, RS232, Telnet, dial-in modem etc.  Also show what security levels are available for various types of u sers (i.e. user, super-user, administrator, etc). Provide a list of all ports and protocols required for operation and administration of your solution. 		3.4.4.  Relevant Policies and Procedures 			3.4.4.1.

<SUBJECT>--Lightweight Chemical-Biological Protective Garment (LCBPG)
<DESC>The following are Questions and Answers related to the Request For Information (RFI) posted March 22, 2007 for the LCBPG: 1) It is our understanding that the RFI is seeking a fully developed garment system and not just materials for use in a lightweight garment.  In addition to a non-developmental and/or commercial garment offering, submission of white papers or product conce pts not yet commercially available are encouraged as a prelude to follow-on CB protective ensemble projects.  Is this understanding correct?  Answer:  The acquisition strategy for LCBPG is still in development.  Accordingly, this RFI is not limited to fully-developed garments, information on materials that may be used in development of a Government-Owned design are also sought, as well as white papers, product concepts, material samples, etc. 2) What performance attributes with identified [O] have higher priority for the intended user community?  Will submissions that meet all or most of the performance [O] have any advantage over submissions that simply provide minimal acceptable performance [ T]?  Answer:  There is no priority ranking among the requirements.  Cost and performance may both be factors for any future LCBPG acquisition.  For example, if an item meets all [O] requirements but requires a cost increase of 50%, this would be an identifiable  trade-off.     3) What test method will be used for determining volume and will the volume be measured in a vacuum packaged storage form and in an out-of-bag form?  Answer:  In the event testing is conducted on sample materials or items received in response to this RFI approved ASTM, Military Standards, and AVLAG test operating procedures will be utilized.  Vendors may submit modifications to ASTMs and Military Standa rds (but not AVLAG) if they can technically support in their responses that the material technology warrants adjustments to the test method.  4) Will vapor and aerosol challenges be performed using live chemical agents?  If so, what test method will be used?  Answer:  In the event testing is conducted on sample materials or items received in response to this RFI approved ASTM, Military Standards, and AVLAG test operating procedures will be utilized.  Vendors may submit modifications to ASTMs and Military Standa rds (but not AVLAG) if they can technically support in their responses that the material technology warrants adjustments to the test method. 5) How will noise acceptability be determined - operational trials or lab/chamber tests?  Answer:  In the event testing is conducted on sample materials or items received in response to this RFI approved ASTM, Military Standards, and AVLAG test operating procedures will be utilized.  Vendors may submit modifications to ASTMs and Military Standa rds (but not AVLAG) if they can technically support in their responses that the material technology warrants adjustments to the test method. 6) What exactly does 'Be capable of operation in 5% to 100% relative humidity' mean and how will the capability be determined?  Answer:  The requirement 'Be capable of operation in 5% to 100% relative humidity' means the Government is seeking a material solution that will be capable of performing in multiple climates which includes a range of RH from 5% - 100%.  The RH pertains to both the physical properties of the material and CB protective performance.  If the question is a test methods question then we reserve the right to measure material performance such as breathability, moisture permeation, insulative properties, and CB perm eation using approved ASTM, Military Standards, and AVLAG TOPs.  Vendors may submit modifications to ASTMs and Military Standards (but not AVLAG) if they can technically support in their responses that the material technology warrants adjustments to the te st method.        7) In previous JPMO-IP Programs, protection after saturation from sea or fresh water has been determined using two different water t reatment methods: immersion of the material sample in water and application of 2ml of water on the top of the material sample.  Which saturation treatment method will be used? Answer:  In the event testing is conducted on sample materials or items received in response to this RFI, the Government reserves the right to utilize either immersion or application of water to material samples with respect to the saturation requirement. All information is subject to change by the government.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 26 APR 2007, 10:00 A.M.

The Government intends to make an award to a single offeror who can provide all items identified and as specified herein. Successful offeror shall be the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price and price related factors (2) Delivery schedule. Inquiries and information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this particular acquisition. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Only written responses will be accepted. E-mail responses must be in MS Word, Excel or PDF format. Technical and/or administrative questions must be submitted in writing to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov or Ella.Chapman@dhs.gov.  All responses to this notice shall be received no later than April 30, 2007, 4:00 p.m. Central Time (CT).   

The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 

1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Preparedness Directorate, Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit for a specific "brand name" purchase of a configurable HP ProLiant ML570 G4 Rack Server for the CDP Information Technology (IT) office.  The HP ProLiant servers are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  These servers are required to augment equipment currently in use by the IT center.  

3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase of a configurable HP ProLiant ML570 G4 rack server. 

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".

5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited.  
The HP ProLiant server is necessary in order for all systems currently in use at the CDP to function without interruption. Attempting to integrate an alternate system into the current structure would create huge management issues regarding hard drive compatibility, maintaining spare parts and patch management issues.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Efforts have been made to identify other contractors for this requirement by soliciting this requirement from known computer sources as well as in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested Hewlett-Packard dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in this acquisition.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon sufficient competition obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps, the vendor's commercial product price list and quotes obtained through open market research.

8.  Description of Market Research.  Upon initial receipt of this requirement, a market survey was conducted to determine if this requirement could be solicited among small businesses, through open market research and under the GSA Schedule. Multiple businesses, many of whom were small businesses, were found to be capable of providing the HP product. It is not the CDP's intent to sole source to Hewlett Packard; the intent is to solicit full and open using the combined synopsis solicitation with the expectation that businesses can quote the item through partnering with Hewlett Packard or acting as a distributor for HP products. All interested HP dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in this acquisition.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
In order to minimize compatibility issues, the necessity of maintaining a standard image, decrease patch management issues and reduce the need for stockpiling spare parts and hard drives it is necessary to control the types of equipment used.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is Hewlett-Packard and its dealers/distributors. 

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.   No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition will be taken, as the Hewlett-Packard "brand name" is the only known system capable of satisfying this agency's requirement.

Proposals shall be evaluated only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following two (2) non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1 - Technical capability and Factor 2 - Past Performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then that its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 - Technical capability - The minimum criteria for acceptably for this factor shall be the submission a list of key personnel and their current certification by the National Association of the Deaf, or the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, or be included in Virginia's Directory of qualified Interpreters.

Factor 2 - Past Performance - By past performance the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for the same or similar type products

(b)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

ATTACHMENT 4 - BEST VALUE SELECTION CRITERIA –  revision date 19 April 2007
IAW FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Criteria listed in the solicitation the Government intends to award to the offeror proposing the most advantageous solution.  Therefore when it is in the best interest of the Government award will be made to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Basis for evaluation and selection will be:
FACTOR 1:  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY - The offeror:
(a)	Provides all requested specification information.
(b)	Provides software capable of having interfaces with commercially available non-proprietary software.
(c)	Provide real time imaging information include the size of the area, resolution and the speed at which it can be processed
(d)	Provides sufficient information on operating/maintenance manuals to determine requirements for maintaining equipment.
(e)	Provides proposed implied and explicit warranty information.
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY RATINGS:
Exceptional - Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive a blue.
Acceptable - Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the request for proposal; proposal rated green must have no deficiencies but may have one or more strengths.
Marginal - Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the request for proposal, but any such uncertainty is correctable.
Unacceptable - Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has one or more deficiencies.   Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.
FACTOR 2:  PRICE
The offeror’s Cost/Price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404 (Proposal Analysis), in order to determine if it is reasonable and realistic.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business.  Normally price reasonableness on a competitive FFP line time is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404-1(b).  For additional information see FAR 31.201.3.
FACTOR 3:  PAST PERFORMANCE
Questionnaires received will be evaluated and the contractor assigned a Pass/Fail rating.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for firm-fixed-price commercial item overhaul prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-07-Q-300224 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.
This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued for the acquisition of Upgrade and Overhaul of Cooling Turbine NSN 1660-00-897-4306, P/N 203720-1 to NSN 1660-01-438-5697, P/N 203720-3-1; Quantity 2, IAW AFTO 15A3-2-40-3 (latest revision). The item is Flight Critical and ACMS Tracked. The Coast Guard does not maintain nor distribute Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the TOs. Contract award will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications e.g., DOD certification, to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairables which are determined ?Beyond Economical Repair?.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive, will not be considered reasons for ?over and above? proposals, and will not necessitate renegotiation of the overhaul price. However, the value of any component provided to the contractor as GFM will be deducted from the firm-fixed-price of the overhaul or presented as a credit to the Government. Repairable items received that indicate (1) obvious misuse, (2) Cannibalization/missing parts, (3) severe damage due to mishandling or (4) crash damage are not included in the FFP pricing. The USCG reserves the right to provide GFP/GFM to the contractor should it be determined to be in the best interests of the Government. GFM required as a result of misuse, cannibalization etc., discovered upon receipt, will not be deducted from the FFP overhaul price. The contractor shall within 15 days of determining unusual damage submit a condition report notifying the Contracting Officer of Unusually Damaged Items. Unusual damage report depicting conditions (1), (2), (3), (4) proposed for ?over and above? work shall list all parts and labor requirements. ?Over and above? work will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer and negotiated separately from the FFP pricing. Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairables be determined ?Beyond Economical Repair?, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The contractor will be entitled to the flat scap rate charge specified in the award document.  Only ?factory new? material is acceptable or new surplus with traceability to the OEM. Inspection by Certificate of Conformance and acceptance shall be performed at destination by USCG ARSC QA. Items shipped to: USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Attn: Receiving Section, Bldg 63, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001. The desired delivery date is 30 calendar days after receipt of material but earlier delivery is acceptable at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. FOB point shall be Destination. Components specified for rework/overhaul are serial number tracked by the Coast Guard?s (ACMS) Aviation Computerized Maintenance System. The contractor shall maintain a legible component tracking form for each item reworked or overhauled. A sample can be provided upon request. Vendor must provide a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with FAR 52.246-15. Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.  Packaging of the items for return shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor's best commercial practices with the following exceptions:  1) Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton, or crate, 2) Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with NSN, Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Purchase Order Number, and Line Item.  Only Bar Coding of the NSN is necessary.  The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage.  Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage.  Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material:  popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging. The closing date for receipt of offers is 30 April 2007, 2:00 pm, Local Time.  Quotes will be accepted via Facsimile at 252-335-6452, electronically via Email at william.t.kingsley@uscg.mil.

HSAR 3052.209-70 Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates.  (Jun 2006)
 (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 ?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. ?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. ?Inverted Domestic Corporation.? A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.  
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time consuming litigation.

<DESC>18 April 2007 1. Will the contracting office be issuing a DD254 for the Facility Clearance? Answer: No, the DD 254 is available electronically.   2. Does the prime need to possess the Facility Clearance or can it belong to a subcontractor? Answer: The prime  3. Paragraph 27 states, The contractor shall provide the NACLC or higher clearance documentation with their quote package.  Is this required only of the lead instructor or do we need to provide the documentation for our proposed general instructors as we ll? Answer: Required for the Lead Instructor, the submitter may provide them for as many others as it desires  4. Is the sample matrix provided solely for the purposes of illustration and discussion or does the Government intend to adhere to roughly a similar training schedule based on the number of personnel provided in the matrix?  Please clarify. Answer: The provided matrix is a sample for use in preparing quotes for the solicitation. As stated in solicitation Para. 4.1.3., the performance Schedule Execution Matrix will be included in each task order. 5. Do the dates provided in the sample matrix represent training start dates or do they represent an actual day on which eight (8) hours of training shall be provided?  For example, the matrix shows two training dates for class 1.  Since training must be p rovided over three days, we assume that these dates represent preferred training start dates and not the only dates on which training will be provided for this class, as this would represent only two days of training and not three days of training per the RFQ.  Are we correct in assuming that these are start dates?  Please clarify. Answer: Assume those are training start dates. 6. When does the Government anticipate making an award for this procurement?  Will the award be made less than a month from receipt of responses to the RFQ? Answer: The Government intends to award as soon as possible after giving full consideration to the responses received and in accordance with the applicable acquisition regulations.  However, award may be delayed due to outside factors.  7. Our firm recently received 8(a) certification from the U.S. Small Business Administration.  Given the stage of our firms development, may past performance of our principals be substituted for corporate past performance?  Answer: Past performance of a newly constituted business entity may substitute the past performance of its principal employees in accordance with the applicable acquisition regulations. See FAR 9.1, 13.106, and 15.3 (even though this is not a negotiated pr ocurement) as stated in FAR 12.206 and 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.
