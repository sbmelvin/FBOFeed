Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)
The Department of the Air Force, Electronic Systems Center, 551 ELSG/PK at Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division, Litton Guidance and Control Systems Division, Woodland Hills, CA 91637 to produce approximately thirty-six (36) new Embedded GPS Inertials (EGIs) and modify and upgrade the E-3 inventory (currently at 110 units) to the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) configuration. This effort will have a three year period of performance if options are exercised. A Sources Sought Synopsis was published to FedBizzOpps on 02 October 2006 under the title of "Navigation Warfare Production". The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) entitled "One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c)1. 
The Government has determined that an award to any source other than Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Additionally, this notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Please direct questions to Edna Alonis, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-5747, EMAIL: Edna.Alonis@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKELECTRICAL CORRECTIONS PHASE IIThe VA Medical Center, Beckley, WV has a need to complete Electrical Corrections Phase II project.  The project consists of the replacement of existing primary switchgear breakers and unit substation 1 and 2 secondary switchgear breakers in existing hospital buildings in Beckley, West Virginia. This project is comprised of changing breakers that are old and can no longer be serviced with new breakers. It is impractical to completely change out the switchgear due to the extended power interruption this would cause. Existing breakers that are to be replaced with new breakers in the existing switchgear include primary breakers in building 22 and secondary breakers in unit substations 1 and 2 in building one. In addition, this project will install new breakers in existing spaces in substation 1, substation 2 and substation 3. The feeds to DP-X-Ray and DP-CT and the portable MRI are to be reconfigured so that they are able to be served from the essential electrical system.  This will include the addition of a new breaker in S-2, transformer, disconnect switch, automatic transfer switch and new distribution panel.  Feeds to panels DPR-1 and DPL-1 are to also be reconfigured so that they are able to be served from the essential electrical system.  This will include a new breaker in S-3, the existing cell space and bussing are to be modified to accept the new breaker, a new automatic transfer switch and distribution panel.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four DME MACs under contract to CMS.     The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME PSCs).     These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function.
The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare.

The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to     1. coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); 2. provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; 3. provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; 4. develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs; and, 5. establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations.

The successful offeror must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS.     There are no exceptions to this requirement; offers which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.

In addition, the successful offeror:

- must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days);

- must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame;

- will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier;

- must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors;

- must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and

- must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes.

CMS intends to issue a solicitation for a competitive procurement for the PDAC Contractor - Medicare Administrative Contractor (PDAC MAC). It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

1. PURPOSE:
This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA is conducting market research, via this market survey, to determine the capabilities and interest of vendors to fulfill a requirement of the Navigation Services Directorate for professional services.  These services cover such areas as engineering support, logistics, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, business and material management.  Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing and lighting systems.  Interested vendors are also encouraged to submit feedback regarding the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).
At this time, the nature of this competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 of the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), this market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition would exist if this acquisition were set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are 541330, 541511, 541611, 541614, 561110, and 541990.  Interested firms are asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form.
Attachment A is the Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  This Draft SOW represents all anticipated contractor support requirements.  Interested vendors are requested to comment on the range of services scope.  Also, provide company size, capabilities, and previous experience in providing similar services.
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.   Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms to respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses, instead of being a small business set aside.  Any information provided under this request for comments is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  Any proprietary information submitted must be adequately marked as proprietary and will be protected if appropriately marked.

Selection Process:

The selection process shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, Subpart 36.6 Performance-Based Contracting, and the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-852). Clarifications may be requested at any time.  The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase: during which the SF330 will be evaluated against the selection factor 1-5 listed below to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

The letter notifying those firms selected for the short list will contain an appointment for one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in the Region?s offices and shall not take longer than two (2) hours.  In preparation for their due diligence session, firms should review the websites listed in the SOO. 

Phase 2: Selection Phase:  during which the short-listed firms will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations pursuant to FAR 36.602-3(c).  The additional information will consist of a comprehensive Project Management Plan (PMP), Technical Work Plan (TWP), and a Quality Management Plan (QMP) that address the firm?s solution to meeting the SOO.  The page limit for the plans (total) is 75 pages.  The plans will be reviewed before oral presentations.  

Each of the short-listed firms shall be given an opportunity for oral presentation, which shall be made by the firm?s key personnel/management team.  After reviewing the Phase 2 submission, a letter will be sent to each of the short listed firms scheduling a date for the firm?s oral presentation and containing a list of questions covering the Phase 2 submission.  Each firm is responsible for ensuring that any required presentation tools and personnel are available and working properly for their presentation.  During the oral presentation, the short-listed firms may be requested to provide further clarification concerning their submission.  After oral presentations, the firms will be evaluated and ranked, based on the information presented in their Phase II submission and Oral presentation. 

Selection factor 1-6 listed below will be used for making the final selection(s).  

Unsuccessful firms and firms selected for negotiation of a contract will be notified.

Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection and will proceed until sufficient awards have been made.

Selection Factor:
Six (6) factors will be used in the selection of firms.  Factors 1 through 5 will be used to evaluate firm?s SF-330s during Phase 1.  Factors 1, 2 and 3 are considered critical and are of equal value; Factors 4 and 5 are less important than Factors 1, 2 and 3, and are listed in descending order of importance.  In addition to Factors 1 through 5, Factor 6 will be used to evaluate the firm?s Phase 2 submission (PMP, TWP, and QMP) during Phase 2.  Factor 6 is less important than factors 1, 2 and 3 and more important than Factor 4 and 5.  Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate. Only Factors 2 and 6 have subfactors. For those factors, subfactors are of equal value.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Philadelphia Site intends to procure fifteen (15) types (43 units in total) of thermal magnetic Type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers originally manufactured by SPD Technologies. Operational and performance requirements for both type of Circuit Breakers approved for use on Navy ships are contained in Military Specification MIL-DTL-7361G(SH). SPD Technologies is the only source that has successfully completed qualification testing for the Circuit Breakers covered by the proposed acquisition and is listed in QPL-17361-14 dated 28 April 2006 as the only qualified manufacturer. Since SPD Technologies discontinued production of thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers back in 2003, surplus or reconditioned circuit breakers will be acceptable due to the anticipated lack of new units. While in certain instances electronic circuit breakers have been found to be a suitable form, fit and functional replacement for a the! rmal magnetic circuit breaker, this is not the case for the type of AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers covered by the proposed acquisition. Due to the lack of replacement thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the proposed acquisition has been initiated to procure thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers originally manufactured by SPD Technologies in accordance with Military Specification MIL-DTL-17361G(SH).  These Circuit Breakers will be used to replace the failed units in the field and alleviate the impact of the obsolescence problems caused by SPD Technologies discontinuing the production of thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers. The Circuit Breakers to be procured shall be reconditioned items originally manufactured by SPD Technologies in accordance with Military Specification MIL-DTL-17361G(SH) dated 19 September 2006. The Circuit Breakers shall be reconditioned in accordance with N! AVSEA Standard Item Number 009-75 dated 29 July 2004 including the performance of operational tests which require the close and trip of each circuit breaker electrically and manually from local and remote stations four (4) consecutive, successful times and ensure that the generator heater interlock is de-energized by the generator circuit breaker. A Firm Fixed Priced contract is anticipated month period. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources including California Marine Supply, Inc., 7975 North U.S. Highway 89, Flagstaff, AZ 86004, Electro-Mech of Virginia, Inc., 11860 Fishing Point Drive, Newport News, VA 23606 and Surplus Electrical Innovations, Inc., 610 West 24th Street, Norfolk, VA 23517 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 423610. Interested parties may communicate their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received withi! n thirty (30) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract among responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written requests can be submitted to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division Philadelphia Office, 5001 South Broad Street, Building 4, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403, Attn: John Stefano, Code 3352.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sperian Instrumentation, 651 South Main Street, Middletown, CT , for the acquisition of three (3) PosiChek3 Performance Testers to test Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment aboard U.S. Coast Guard Vessels.   The SCBA is a cylinder fed, open circuit respirator that supplies positive pressure breathing air to the user.   The Supplied Air Respirator with Backup Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SAR/SCBA) provides a portable compressed air supply capability for inspection of suspected immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) environments.  The SCBA is NIOSH-approved respiratory protection equipment, and is the preferred equipment for initial gas-free inspections.  This equipment is sole source for the following reasons.  A properly maintained SCBA must be capable of meeting basic NIOSH / NFPA performance requirements. Unfortunately, given the hard ! usage that SCBA receive, performance can sometimes "slip".   NFPS 1852 mandates that all compliant SCBA must be tested on a calibrated breathing machine before being put into service and at least once per year thereafter. Unless SCBA are regularly tested to verify proper performance, a loss of function may not be noticed until after an accident has occurred. The PosiChek3 manufactured by Sperian Instrumentation is the only system that automatically determines the operational fitness of an SCBA by means of a series of dynamic tests and functional checks. PosiChek3 testers quantitatively determine whether the current performance of an SCBA meets NIOSH and NFPA requirements. Regular PosiChek3 testing ensures that SCBA which require maintenance are identified and taken out of service before an accident occurs, not after.   Therefore it is critical that this equipment is acquired from Sperian Instrumentation.  FSC:  4240.  NAICS:  334516.Size Standard:  500 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends on soliciting the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine (IOM) 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 as the sole candidate  pursuant to FAR 13.106-1 (b).  The IOM Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine was established in 1998 to bring together stakeholders from industry, government, academia, environmental groups, and foundations to explore the complex links between health and the environment.
Members include representatives from federal agencies, academic researchers, professional societies, associations, and private industry.  The activities conducted by the Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides a structured opportunity for the exchange of information and the identification of mutual concerns among interested parties in a nonadversarial setting.
The Roundtable convenes twice a year and, in addition, meets twice in conjunction with small public conferences.  Funding for these Roundtable meetings comes from various federal and non-federal sources who are interested in supporting the meetings and who have an interest in the outcome as provided in Roundtable reports.  The EPA is one of these interested parties.
The primary mission of ORD's National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is to perform mission-oriented ecological and human health exposure research in support of Agency needs.  The NERL wishes to fund a portion of the costs for the Roundtable meetings to be held during 2008.  Funding a portion of the Roundtable costs will allow NERL to obtain a report of the Roundtable meetings and conferences which will help the Agency enhance environmental health, and aid in developing clinical and environmental health research strategies.
It should be emphasized that EPA has not "selected" the Institute of Medicine, or the Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research and Medicine, for this noncompetitive procurement.  Rather, EPA wishes to provide funding for the currently scheduled Roundtable meetings during 2008 in order to obtain the resulting report. 	NAICS Code 541611 applies with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  This is a firm fixed price simplified acquisition procurement.  The period of performance will be 12 months and is anticipated to be awarded in May of 2008.  This synopsis is to serve notification of the Agency's intent, therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.  Correspondence pertaining to this notification can be submitted to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<p>a.&nbsp; Provide an independent, impartial audit of healthcare claims.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Measure and report the accuracy of claims payment and payment record coding for health care claims processed by MCS, TDEFIC, ADDP, TPHARM, and the TOP contractors and provide insight for targeting quality improvement activities and information.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Provide comprehensive and timely reviews that are consistent with all TRICARE requirements, reflecting high quality work for all work assigned.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Technical and Contractual History:&nbsp; The solicitation performance requirements are not significantly different from the current contract.&nbsp; The acquisition is for a fixed price contract, for a total performance period made up of a base period and five one year options.</p>

The focus of this procurement will be to develop, implement and manage a T/TA delivery system that balances coordination and analytic capacity at the core or national level with service delivery capacity in each of the five designated regions of the National Prevention Network (NPN). 

The purpose of the CAPT?s national core is to provide centralized direction, monitoring of service quality, consistency, and responsiveness to clients, evaluation of service impacts, coordination and analytic capabilities. The national core will connect to five separate Regionally-based Expert Teams to establish a coordinated training and technical assistance system aimed at building the capacity of SAMHSA/CSAP grantees and the capabilities of the prevention workforce.    The purpose of the Regionally-based Expert Teams is to conduct ongoing assessment of the T/TA needs of the SAMHSA/CSAP grantees located within each respective Region and deliver targeted and timely T/TA services to assist grantees in achieving their specific program objectives and benchmarks.  Regionally-based Expert Teams will consist of staff, associates, and consultants who are currently established in their respective Regions and have existing professional T/TA relationships with those States, Jurisdictions, Tribal organizations and other relevant substance abuse prevention entities within the Region. 

The anticipated period of performance is a base period of 12 months, plus four (4) 12-month option periods. The estimated date for issuance of the RFP is April 1, 2008 with proposal responses due on April 30, 2008.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, is in the initial planning stages of a requirement to overhaul generating units G22, G23, and G24 (rated at 825,642 KVA) at the Third Powerplant, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee, Washington, located approximately 90 miles west of Spokane, Washington.
The generators require a major overhaul.  Examples of some specific site work include overhauling the generator thrust and guide bearings, and turbine components such as wicket gates, operating rings, linkage arms, wicket gate bushings, and furnishing and installing a new mechanical seal to replace the existing packing box.  
The entire scope of the project includes planning, engineering, scheduling, disassembly, inspections, repairs, replacements, modifications, reassembly, and re-commissioning of the units.  It is anticipated the work will take from 1-2 years to complete each unit and actual disassembly of the first unit is not anticipated to begin until early 2010. It is anticipated that the exciters and excitation transformers will also be replaced, and the governors modified from electrical to digital, by separate contracts during the overhaul outages.  
Reclamation is currently investigating options on how to best accomplish this work.  We are seeking industry input regarding potential options for performing the work.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY, TO ASSIST US IN DETERMINING OUR FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE UPCOMING OVERHAULS.  Our potential options are:  1) performing all work with Government forces; 2) performing all work by contract; or 3) contracting for planning, engineering, scheduling, inspections, and oversight, with actual onsite work (disassembly, repairs, replacements, modifications, and reassembly of the units) performed by the Government.  
Reclamation is seeking input from offerors who have expertise overhauling generators of this size as to what options may work best, based on previous experiences.  We invite you to offer your comments regarding how you suggest is best to perform the work, including which option(s) you would be interested in and qualified to perform.  Along with your comments, please provide a summary of your qualifications that demonstrates your competence in overhauling units of this size by April 29, 2008.  Please send your comments to skramer@pn.usbr.gov. 
These generators were initially installed in 1978, 1979, and 1980.  They are rated at 825,642 KVA.  Specific data for the machines is as follows:

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, is in the initial planning stages of a requirement to overhaul generating units G22, G23, and G24 (rated at 825,642 KVA) at the Third Powerplant, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee, Washington, located approximately 90 miles west of Spokane, Washington.
The generators require a major overhaul.  Examples of some specific site work include overhauling the generator thrust and guide bearings, and turbine components such as wicket gates, operating rings, linkage arms, wicket gate bushings, and furnishing and installing a new mechanical seal to replace the existing packing box.  
The entire scope of the project includes planning, engineering, scheduling, disassembly, inspections, repairs, replacements, modifications, reassembly, and re-commissioning of the units.  It is anticipated the work will take from 1-2 years to complete each unit and actual disassembly of the first unit is not anticipated to begin until early 2010. It is anticipated that the exciters and excitation transformers will also be replaced, and the governors modified from electrical to digital, by separate contracts during the overhaul outages.  
Reclamation is currently investigating options on how to best accomplish this work.  We are seeking industry input regarding potential options for performing the work.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY, TO ASSIST US IN DETERMINING OUR FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE UPCOMING OVERHAULS.  Our potential options are:  1) performing all work with Government forces; 2) performing all work by contract; or 3) contracting for planning, engineering, scheduling, inspections, and oversight, with actual onsite work (disassembly, repairs, replacements, modifications, and reassembly of the units) performed by the Government.  
Reclamation is seeking input from offerors who have expertise overhauling generators of this size as to what options may work best, based on previous experiences.  We invite you to offer your comments regarding how you suggest is best to perform the work, including which option(s) you would be interested in and qualified to perform.  Along with your comments, please provide a summary of your qualifications that demonstrates your competence in overhauling units of this size by April 29, 2008.  Please send your comments to skramer@pn.usbr.gov. 
These generators were initially installed in 1978, 1979, and 1980.  They are rated at 825,642 KVA.  Specific data for the machines is as follows:
1.	97.5% Power Factor2.	85.7 RPM3.	98 RPM Over speed4.	15,000 volts generator terminal voltage5.	32,000 normal and maximum stator amps6.	12,000 stator amperes with no stator cooling7.	60 hertz8.	3 phase9.	86 poles10.           540 stator coils
Weights and Measurements

<DESC><p align="justify">NOTICE TEXT: The General Services Administration, Region 1, Boston, MA, under an Interagency Agreement with the Department of Commerce, Office of Computer Services, located in Springfield, VA posts this Sources Sought (SS) Notice pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.201 and for information and planning purposes only. The purpose of this SS is to identify whether qualified FAR Part 19 Small Business Program sources&nbsp;are interested in and capable of performing the work set forth in this notice. No contract will be awarded from this announcement and this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Response to this SS is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this SS and any follow-on information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time - please do not call and ask for a copy of the solicitation. DESCRIPTION of WORK: Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure systems administration and operational support for the computer resource facility of the Department of Commerce (DoC), Office of the Secretary (O/S), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Office of Computer Services (OCS). The mission of the OCS is to operate a central Enterprise IT resource facility supporting the Office of the Secretary, DoC Bureaus, and other Federal agencies. These services include, but are not limited to: legacy mainframe batch and interactive processing, Linux/UNIX system services, Enterprise database management services, client server services, teleprocessing support, and web application hosting. Virtually all of the projects that contribute to the customers' missions utilize IT resources provided by OCS. OCS owns none of the applications or data hosted at the data center, rather, OCS provides the Infrastructure support of the computers, and the network supporting the computers that is essential to OCS customer projects. The work requires and ensures that the IT Infrastructure computer resource facility meets all requirements for systems administration and operational support to enable the DoC and other Federal Agencies to successfully achieve their computer services requirements. The OCS computer center is located at 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, with an off-site storage facility at the main DoC location at 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington DC. OCS currently provides systems and operational support for IBM 9672 and z/890 Enterprise Servers, Linux/UNIX, and Microsoft Windows platform servers. OCS diverse platforms are interconnected utilizing state-of-the-art telecommunication equipment and protocols including, but not limited to, CISCO routers, network hubs, switches, modems, protocol converters, SNA, frame relay, and TCP/IP. The OCS computer center is fully staffed during normal work hours and operationally staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. In this environment, the workload is heavy and unpredictable, and hundreds of users' daily productivity depends upon system availability, rapid interactive response, and fast batch turnaround times. The work requires ongoing emergency and non-emergency support as needed. The work requires "on-call" service to address any issues that may arise before and/or after normal business hours, including holidays. OCS designates contractor personnel as "on-call" in a documented schedule. Detailed records including software inventory, user support requests, and server/workstation configuration guidance is required. The work is performed closely with appropriate OCS personnel ensuring full user support during business hours and adjusted work schedules to encompass after-hours work as necessary on mission-critical systems that must remain active during core hours. Development and maintenance work on holidays and weekends is scheduled on an "as needed" basis upon Government customer requirements. Because the OCS data center is required to provide near 100 percent operational up-time, other support personnel, <em>e.g.</em>, system and network administrators, system programmers, are on call any hour. Work is required nights and weekends to accommodate maintenance and testing schedules. In total, the work provides operations, maintenance, management, and technology enhancement services supporting a 24x7x365/day Enterprise IT infrastructure on behalf of OCS. Until the data center is moved to another Washington, D.C. Metro location, the work under the task order shall be performed at the OCS computer service facility in Springfield, VA, with necessary local travel to the off-site storage facility in Washington, DC. During the period of the relocation of the data center, additional resources may be needed to assist in the planning and execution of the data center move. It is also probable that the number of full time positions required to support the OCS data center will increase over the period of this award. Overall, the following services are required: Project Management; IBM Mainframe Systems Programming (z/OS, z/VM, and Linux/UNIX); Computer Facility Management and Network Operations Control Center; Network Architect Support and Firewall Administration; Application and Database Support; Enterprise Security Administration; Multi-platform Database Administration; Application Administration; Operating Systems Support; Windows; Linux/UNIX; z/OS; z/VM; IT Special Project Assistance; OCS Web Site Design and Implementation; IT Asset Tracking; IT Infrastructure Move Assistance; Transition Planning Support; Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations Plan Support. EVM, in accordance with best industry practices, is required for managing the work. The qualities and operating characteristics of earned value management systems are described in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standard-748-A-1998, <em>Earned Value Management Systems. </em>A copy of the standard is available from Global Engineering Documents (1-800-854-7179). The following information is historical data designed to help potential sources respond to this SS. Each category or description equals the equivalent of one (1) full-time position unless otherwise noted: (SERVER) Windows Server / Desktop OS; Windows Server/ Desktop OS/Exchange; Windows Server / Exchange; Windows Server; (NETWORK) VOIP; (2) CCNE.

Project Title:  National and Regional System for the Application of Prevention Technologies (NR-SAPT)

Project Description: The goal of this project is to implement and manage the National and Regional System for the Application of Prevention Technologies (NR-SAPT) to provide targeted training and technical assistance (T/TA) for grantees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), to implement all five steps and two cross-cutting principles of SAMHSA?s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) and accountability systems for performance measurement and management.  SAMHSA/CSAP grantees include:  States, Jurisdictions and Federally-recognized Tribal entities supported under SAMHSA?s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Program and  CSAP?s Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) including, but not limited to:  42 Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) Program grantees; approximately 150  Minority/AIDS/HIV Prevention Initiative grantees; approximately 12  Methamphetamine Prevention Initiative grantees; and, 23 epidemiological work groups supported by SAMHSA in non-SPF SIG States.

The focus of this procurement will be to develop, implement and manage a T/TA delivery system that balances core coordination and analytic capacity at the national level with service delivery capacity in each of the five designated regions of the National Prevention Network (NPN). 

The purpose of the national core of this system is to provide centralized direction, monitoring of service quality and responsiveness to clients, evaluation of service impacts, coordination and analytic capabilities. The national core will connect to five separate Regionally-based Expert Teams to establish a coordinated training and technical assistance system aimed at building the capacity of SAMHSA/CSAP grantees and the capabilities of the prevention workforce.    The purpose of the Regionally-based Expert Teams is to conduct ongoing assessment of the T/TA needs of the SAMHSA/CSAP grantees located within each respective Region and deliver targeted and timely T/TA services to assist grantees in achieving their specific program objectives and benchmarks.  Regionally-based expert teams will consist of staff, associates, and consultants who are currently established in their respective Regions and have existing professional T/TA relationships with those States, Jurisdictions, Tribal organizations and other relevant entities within the Region.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).     The Marine Corps Systems Command is requesting information concerning the governance, development, and operation of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the United States Marine Corps at the tactical and enterprise levels.  This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas, initiatives, and/or processes related to this request.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).  Furthermore, the Government does not intend to pay for any information/items, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI.  Responders are solely responsible for all costs and expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All infor! mation received in response to this RFI will be treated as business confidential information, however, any proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  Moreover, in accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   Background The Department of Defense has directed the migration of the military services legacy network architectures to implement service oriented architectures within the enterprise and to the greatest extent possible down through the tactical level.  The Marine Corps considers the tactical level as everything within the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and the enterprise as everything external to the MAGTF.  Multiple programs within Marine Corps Systems Command are endeavoring to implement SOA in order to align with DoD and USMC requirements.  Additionally, the MAGTF C2 Systems and Applications program was created to focus disparate USMC C2 program efforts towards a common goal and delivery in order to dramatically improve the Marine Corps ability to respond to change, reduce costs, and accelerate the delivery of new systems and applications to the operating forces.  However, if not implemented correctly, the transition to a SOA will greatly disrupt operations at the tactical ! and enterprise level, increase costs, and adversely effect combat efficiency.Because SOA is a relatively new concept to the Marine Corps, MCSC personnel do not have depth of knowledge and experience that is available in the commercial sector concerning the governance, development, and operations of a SOA.  The focus of this RFI is to identify potential opportunities in partnering that will assist MCSC personnel in implementing SOA.  This RFI invites information, ideas, initiatives, and/or processes from all interested entities regarding: Assistance and support is needed in, but not limited to the following:	The development and implementation of governance standards for a SOA.	Configuration management of services and data within a SOA.	Information assurance accreditation of services.	Identification, development, and quality of services.	Discoverability and accessibility of services.	Migration of legacy applications to a SOA.	Run-time policy and service level management of a SOA.	Dealing with change and problems unique to implementing a SOA.	Implementing a SOA in a fluid and disconnected environment typically found at the tactical level.	Using SOA to span the gap between the enterprise and tactical levels.	How to transition to a SOA while maintaining the Marine Corps operational uniqueness and without disrupting operations.	Manpower and training implications of SOA.	Contracting strategies beyond the traditional prime/sub suppler relationships to minimize barriers to entry to promote innovation. 	Entrance criteria for SOA-based Technology Insertion/adoption and the SOA-germane definitions of Technology Readiness Levels. 	Defining services for general purpose application and extensions to satisfy a niche such as for a specific domain.  	Identification of infrastructure and governance required to implement SOA (what are the prerequisite technologies, data management strategy, and governance).	Identification of how technology aligns with NCES and NESI.	The governance of a services oriented architecture within the Marine Corps unique environment.	The development of a services oriented architecture without disrupting current operations.	The operations of services oriented architecture within the Marine Corps structure/organization.All information, ideas, initiatives, and/or processes should try to meet to following criteria. 	Will the information assist the Marine Corps transition to a SOA in a timely and effective manner by 2015?	Is the information based upon actual experiences within the public and private sectors?	Is the information focused on process rather than product?	Will the information give the Marine Corps flexibility to adapt to changing SOA implementations, requirements, and policies within DoD?Please submit responses via email to the Contracting Officer and please limit submissions to less than 3MB.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for a new Water Packaging System (WPS). The existing Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) pack system has a hydration sleeve that accommodates a "Camel Back" type bladder called the On The Move Drink System. The packaged water created by the WPS must be compatible with the Camel Back without transferring from another container.
The WPS needs to be rugged, automated, and skid mounted so that it can be mounted on a standard HMMWV trailer without exceeding the towing capacity of the HMMWV (4200 pounds).

<DESC><p>This action is a Request for Information only.&nbsp; The Government does not presently intend to contract, but wants to generate a list of interested parties and general information regarding an on-site solar electricity generation project at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ (DMAFB).</p>
<p>DMAFB would like to know if there are parties interested in developing a solar electricity generation project on DMAFB as part of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).&nbsp; It is anticipated that DMAFB would purchase the entire electricity output of the solar electricity generation system over a 20-year period under a PPA.&nbsp; The current DMAFB energy profile is as follows:&nbsp; a baseload of 8 MW; a 2 MW summertime increase; and a summertime peak load of 21 MW.&nbsp; DMAFB consumes approximately 100 million kWh per year, and is currently enrolled in the Tucson Electric Power Co. (TEP) rate plan titled "Large Light &amp; Power Rate 14 (Minimum Demand = 3,000 kW).</p>
<p>The Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) became effective 14 August 2007, and utilities have filed their renewable energy implementation plans with the Arizona Corporation Commision (ACC).&nbsp; DMAFB is a TEP customer.&nbsp; The TEP Renewable Energy Implementation Plan is still under consideration by the ACC.&nbsp; Also, interested parties should be aware that TEP filed a rate case with the ACC on 02 July 2007 and rates could increase by an average of 15 to 23 percent by 01 January 2009.&nbsp; The TEP rate case is not yet settled.</p>
<p>DMAFB expects the responder to be capable of designing, financing, installing, operating, and maintaining a solar electricity system rated between 4MW (DC) and 12MW (DC) that can produce between 8,000 MWH and 25,000 MWH per year.&nbsp; The system will be located on federal property at DMAFB and may be located at several sites.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;DMAFB expects the developer to own, operate, and maintain the solar electricity system for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide information describing their capabilities and experience pertinent to this Request for Information, as well as general company overview.&nbsp; DMAFB would also be interested in any discussion regarding the technical and economic aspects of potential large scale solar electricity generation opportunities at DMAFB.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Department of  the Interior (The Department) will be implementing the Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) during fiscal years 2008 through 2012.  FBMS will be used by eight Department Bureaus and the DOI National Business Center. DOI Bureaus include the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation. Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Minerals Management Service, National Park Service, Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation, and U.S. Geological Survey. Bureaus will be scheduled to implement FBMS throughout the lifecycle of the project.
As a result, the Department will begin using FedConnect, which is hosted by Compusearch, as the communications portal for its trading partners beginning in mid April 2008. Therefore, in order to do business with the Department, all current and potential trading partners must be registered with Compusearch's FedConnect portal. 
Notices and solicitations, required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), will continue to be sent to FedBizOpps (FBO).  A link will be established from FBO with additional information available to interested entities on Compusearch's FedConnect portal.  The FedConnect portal will be used throughout the lifecycle of the Department's acquisition from the presolicitation/planning phase to instrument close-out. The Department's FBMS will communicate with external entities via FedConnect on all matters related to the acquisition.
We are advising current and potential Department trading partners to register with FedConnect at your earliest convenience at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  Please note FedConnect is used by multiple federal agencies and therefore, assistance with FedConnect will be provided by Compusearch, not the Department of the Interior. Registration information is provided on the FedConnect web site.
In addition, we are requiring that all trading partners that wish to do business with the Department of Interior register with the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov/ to facilitate registration on FedConnect.  The system functionality of FedConnect requires that all trading partners be registered with the CCR, before registering with FedConnect.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSFE01-08-Q-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotations.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This acquisition is a total Small Business Set-Aside, utilizing NAICS Code 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a Size Standard of $6.5 million.  This requirement is also subject to the Service Contract Act, Department of Labor Wage Determination 2005-2255 Revision 6 dated July 5, 2007. The description of requirements for the services acquired is as follows: The Vendor shall provide exercise consulting services related to Chemical Emergency Simulations as follows:  INTRODUCTION - EPA is the federal agency responsible for the protection of the environment including protecting against an accidental or deliberate chemical release from a fixed chemical facility.  EPA partners with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies under the National Contingency Plan to provide technical assistance and training related to chemical emergency preparedness and response. This training and assistance is frequently delivered to state and local government organizations.One primary method used to deliver assistance is through the conduct of FEMA/EPA lead chemical emergency simulations including tabletop, functional and full-scale field exercises. Our goal is to conduct several exercise simulations within the next 18 months. The objective of the assistance program is to simulate a medium scale chemical accident and measure the capabilities of multiple agencies. 
Under this program, the details of the exercise scenario are unknown to the participants until the day of the exercise, but EPA reveals the date, time, and location of the exercises to ensure that all of the key participants will be able to attend. The purpose of a tabletop exercise is to test the participants' ability to implement their contingency plans and procedures and thus demonstrate that their capabilities are adequate to prevent or respond to a chemical or terrorist attack.  EPA lead exercises focus on management of the incident and the ability to deal with preparedness related issues.  The government, with assistance from the contractor, chooses the key participants in the exercise, develops the scenario, and evaluates the exercise.  The exercises are meant to test the response to a chemical or terrorist incident by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the National Response Framework (NRF).  
The desired outcome of the exercises is to enhance unified preparedness and response capabilities in New England.  The exercise process will provide a venue for industries to interact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and responders, and to learn about one another's security and response plans and organizations. The exercise evaluation provides recommendations to improve preparedness and response capabilities and the evaluations should identify strengths and weaknesses in the players' security and response plans so they can be corrected. 
The exercise facilitator should be professional, poised, and have demonstrated expertise in the field of emergency response operations.  Another outcome of the exercises is to test the ability of the industry and the federal, state, and local law enforcement and responders to manage a major emergency response operation, ensure the safety and health of individuals, rapidly restore service, and manage the security and preparedness related issues associated with the incident.  The Exercise and evaluations should be structured to identify strengths and weaknesses in both the industry's contingency plans and the various agencies' plans.  The federal government has an interest in exploring the preparedness, security and policy issues that may arise during the exercises. 
The following contractor support is required to assist FEMA/EPA in meeting their responsibilities: 1) attend and participate in meetings to discuss and design tabletop, functional and field exercises with fixed industrial facilities and local emergency planning committees (LEPC?s), 2) technical support for the conduct of the exercises, 3) simulation support for the exercises and 4) prepare the exercise after-action-report (AAR).  Specific task requirements, provide technical support for conducting chemical emergency simulations at a facility and location within FEMA/EPA Region I.  The contractor will conduct several exercise simulations within the next 18 months.
This task requires scheduling, designing, conducting, controlling and evaluating the exercise.  The exercise will test the preparedness and security of the facility management team, and other federal, state, and local law enforcement and emergency responders. The contractor will work with government and industry representatives who can give detailed information about the selected industrial facility and procedures and the surrounding area to make the scenario more realistic.  The contractor will assist in the design of the scenario and recommend the degree of other players' involvement. The contractor may use field props, audio visual and computer simulation technology and any other equipment the contractor deems will enhance the realism of the exercise. 
The exercises will be held at locations selected by FEMA/EPA and will last approximately 6 hours, not counting breaks. The contractor will lead participants in responding to the exercise's scenario.  The contractor will give each participant a player's manual (i.e., the notebook for each participant, the contents of which includes information such as the exercise scenario, ground rules, feedback forms, and lessons learned) containing the scenario and other relevant information. At a minimum, the contractor will have an administrative and technical support person at each exercise to take notes on the discussions. The contractor will summarize the exercise for FEMA/EPA soon after it is completed. The contractor will work with FEMA/EPA and the designated facility representatives, to complete the exercise summary and after-action-report.
This requires a brief one page summary (letter or email) to be received by FEMA/EPA within three business days after the end of the drill. After incorporating comments from FEMA, EPA, and all evaluators, the contractor will send the final exercise report to the FEMA Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative, (COTR), for approval before the contractor performs distribution to the exercise participants. 
1: Meetings and Presentations 
The contractor will conduct one introductory presentation, describing the exercise procedure and time line, overall scenario development process, and player identification. Representatives from key participating agencies and organizations will be present at this meeting. The contractor will conduct at least three planning meetings, depending upon the scope of the simulation, with stakeholders to: develop the scenario, finalize player involvement, and to gather visual aids, props and reference material that will add realism to the exercise. The contractor will provide one senior analyst and/or a technical specialist and at least one administrative support specialist to conduct the planning meetings and make the presentation.
2:  Exercise Design.  
The exercise design and delivery process will follow the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) (Available at www.fema.gov).   The contractor will work with FEMA/EPA and other interested parties to research and design the exercise scenario and exercise type. The scenario will include exercise events based on exercise objectives that will be developed at the design meeting. The scenario and event script must be extensive enough to engage all participants. The contractor's research will rely on industry contingency plans, local emergency plans, State and local emergency operations plans, maps, atlases, piping and instrumentation diagrams and building schematics.  As part of the research and scenario development process, the contractor will send a technical specialist to visit the site of the exercise. The contractor will write the player's manual and give a copy to each participant. The manual must include at a minimum: the exercise scenario, a visual representation of the site, ground rules for the participants, feedback forms, and pages to make notes for improvements and lessons learned. 
3.  Exercise Conduct. 
The contractor will send, at a minimum, one facilitator and at a minimum three support specialists to the exercise as agreed upon at the planning meetings. The facilitator will be responsible for ensuring that the exercise play addresses all aspects of the release scenario and that all the players fully participate in the exercise. The facilitator will be responsible for keeping the activities focused on the scenario and insure that all agreed upon field props, audio-visual and computer simulation technologies are utilized properly during the exercise. The facilitator will demonstrate poise, professionalism, and a thorough understanding of the technical aspects of the chemical emergency and terrorism response. 
4. Exercise Evaluation.
Within three business days after the exercise ends, the contractor will send a synopsis of the exercise to FEMA/EPA. The synopsis will summarize how the exercise went, who attended and what issues arose. Within 21 business days of the exercise, the contractor will write and submit to EPA/FEMA, an exercise after-action-report. EPA/FEMA will share the draft report with other interested parties and give comments to the contractor, who will incorporate them into the final exercise after-action-report.  FEMA/EPA will distribute the final report to the participants.  Deliverables:  1. Meeting Minutes. The contractor will draft meeting minutes for each of the meetings attended or conducted. Minutes will be submitted to FEMA/EPA within three business days after the meeting ends.  2. Exercise Players' Manuals. The contractor must write a player's manual for each exercise. The manuals must contain an agenda, the scenario, maps or diagrams, and other helpful information. The contractor will provide a player's manual for each participant in the exercise. The contractor must submit a copy of the player's manual to FEMA/EPA one week before the start of the exercise to enable a review and the incorporation of any necessary changes. The player's manual, after review and any necessary edits are completed, are to be issued to the participants on the day of the drill.  3.  Exercise Synopsis. The contractor must submit to FEMA/EPA a written synopsis of the exercise within three business days of completing the exercise. The report will be in a format approved by FEMA/EPA (HSEEP).  Deliverables shall be submitted to EPA in both electronic and paper format.  4.  Exercise After-Action-Reports. The contractor must submit to EPA/FEMA a written report on the exercise within 21 business days of completing an exercise. The report will be in the format approved by EPA/FEMA and will include a list of participants, the scenario, an evaluation  of the issues discussed, and identification of options for strengthening prevention and response.  5.  Exercise Scenario. The scenario must include exercise events based on exercise objectives. The scenario and event script must be extensive enough to engage all participants. The scenario and event script is to be submitted to EPA/FEMA for approval no less than 10 business days before the area exercise begins. 6.  Exercise Props.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.This solicitation is for Advanced Statistical Support for Geospatial Modeling of Coral Status and Different Stressors and is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990- All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10165, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.   A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12 months.  Prospective offerors must go to the stated EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd to obtain any additional information relating to this procurement.BACKGROUND:  US EPA, NHEERL, Gulf Ecology Division is assessing coral health and environmental data from multiple spatial and temporal scales to evaluate the ecological condition of coral reefs in the South Florida Reef tract and provide forecasts for future risks to the sustainability of reefs.  GED has a decade of coral status and environmental primary data from their Florida Keys studies and a variety of secondary data from other studies.  SCOPE:  The purpose of this effort is to (1) apply advanced geospatial and statistical approaches to determine the geospatial relationships between coral health and environmental and anthropogenic stressors in the South Florida Reef, and (2) support the development of predictive models that link changes in the magnitude and duration of stressor exposures to changes in coral health. All data to be used in this contract is provided by EPA.
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/TASK DESCRIPTIONS:  This procurement is for: (a) the conduct of advanced geostatistical and advanced statistical analyses (e.g. multiple logistic regression, nonparametric multivariate methods, Poisson distributions, AICc) of geospatial data on coral status in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas using stressor distributions provided by EPA, (b) support for the development of predictive models which link changes in the magnitude and duration of  stressor exposures to changes in coral status, (c) interpretation of results from advanced statistical and geostatistical analyses to distinguish which environmental factor or combination of factors, best associate to the presence or changes in coral communities and their status and (d) discussion and demonstration of the advanced statistical methods and approaches used in the analyses to EPA staff, during two onsite visits at the Gulf Ecology Division (GED), 1 Sabine Island Drive, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561. The on-site efforts shall include (1) discussion of additional data needs to strengthen advanced statistical relationships between coral status and potential stressors, (2) additional advanced geostatistical and statistical approaches needed to most effectively evaluate these relationships, and (3) advanced statistical approaches to support predictive model development for coral status and stressor impacts.  EPA shall provide use of any available audio\visual electronic equipment required by the Contractor during the on-site visits.DELIVERABLES:  
Deliverable 1.  Within 60 calendar days after the effective date of the contract - An on-site presentation at GED of the proposed work by the Contractor. EPA staff and the Contractor shall discuss all detailed aspects of the project. The Contractor shall make recommendations for a) advanced statistical analyses and approaches to be used, b) additional data which would strengthen advanced statistical relationships, c) models of coral status and potential stressors to be considered, and d) additional advanced statistical analyses recommended to examine relationships between these spatial and temporal associations. The presentation shall occur during an onsite visit by the Contractor to the Gulf Ecology Division. The Contractor shall provide a report after the on-site visit which includes:  a) details of the statistical recommendations and approaches agreed upon during the on-site visit; b) developed work plan; and c) proposed work schedule.  The Contractor shall provide an electronic report within 15 calendar days after the Contractor departed from the on-site visit. 
 Deliverable 2. Within 180 calendar days after the Deliverable 1 report is approved by EPA - An on-site presentation to EPA staff of the geostatistical results following the completion of the analytical and interpretive work on the data. The results shall include but not limited to: a) completed advanced statistical analyses examining relationships of environmental stressors (provided by EPA) to coral status data, b) completed geostatistical evaluation of additional data that was found to strengthen stressor and coral health relationships, c) evaluation of models recommended for predicting coral status after exposure to stressors and d) examination of relationships between spatial and temporal association.  The Contractor shall provide an electronic report which details the advanced statistical results and interpretation within 20 calendar days after the on-site visit.  
The timing of this activity shall (1) follow the Contractor completion of the statistical analyses and interpretation of all the provided data for this project and (2) shall be completed within nine (9) months after the effective date of the contract. 
Deliverable 3.  A final report with data illustrations which: characterize and define relationships, discuss the advanced statistical approaches and QA measures used for geospatial data (See Appendix 1), inherent assumptions, strength of the relationships, and provide recommendations regarding (a) additional data that would strengthen data relationships and (b) future analyses that shall more completely examine and characterize these temporal and spatial associations.  The final report shall contain all detailed information required for reporting statistical methodology, assumptions, limitations, and interpretations required for developing a manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal.  A printed copy and electronic version in Microsoft Word and Excel of the report shall be provided to Project Officer within 11 months after the effective date of the contract.  The report shall be reviewed by EPA within 15 calendar days of receipt of final report; specific topics requiring additional clarification shall be noted.  The contractor shall have 15 calendar days from receipt of the marked-up report to provide the final report. 
APPENDIX 1, Quality Assurance Standards for Geospatial DataAcceptance criteria for choosing geospatial data sources for the project shall ensure the use of the ?best available? data.  The EPA will accept geospatial data from an existing source if the following elements can be determined from a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) or equivalent metadata:  accuracy, completeness, logical consistency, and lineage.  
Accuracy:  There are two kinds of geospatial data accuracy: 1) positional accuracy which is the closeness of the locations of the geospatial features to their true position and 2) attribute accuracy which is the closeness of attribute values (characteristics at the location) to their true values.  Positional accuracy targets apply to the location of sampling points associated with biological data and shall include the Federal Geographic Data Committee?s (FGDC) National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy Test Guidelines and EPA?s Locational Reporting Standard of within 25 meters.Completeness:  The EPA shall accept data from an existing source if both the positional data and attribute data are 80% or more complete.
Logical Consistency:  Logical consistency is attained when the geospatial database complies with the structural characteristics of the data and is compatible with attribute constraints defined for the system. In this  case biological measurements shall be logically consistent with the database of geospatial positioning. The biological/analytical data are keyed to a unique station location (latitude/longitude).  This station location is identified within a South Florida regional segment because its location falls within the boundary of that segment. The regional sections were developed and adopted into the FKNMS Management Plan (Fig 1, Klein & Orlando, 1994).  Each location is identified with part or all of its boundaries which overlap the boundary of the segment.  
Precision:  Precision of geospatial data is defined as the number of decimal places or significant digits in a measurement. The latitude/longitude coordinates in the database are to reflect the actual locations of the sampling stations. Latitude/longitude coordinates shall be in decimal degrees, with a precision of at least 4 decimals. The original latitude/longitude coordinates are to be converted into a GIS format and displayed on maps without loss of precision or accuracy.  Lineage:  Data lineage is the description of the origin and processing history of a data set. It includes the name of the organization that produced the data so that its policies, procedures, and methods can be evaluated to see if they were biased in representing geospatial attributes. Lineage also provides references for data accuracy, how accuracy was determined, and corrections made in producing the source map from which the data were derived.  We shall accept geospatial data from an existing source if we can adequately document the lineage of the data with metadata.
APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  Upon request the following items shall be provided to the contractor: a) an inventory of available data in Excel? Spread Sheet and/or (b) a DVD containing all available data to be used in the performance of this Contract. The data are stored as electronic files in GIS layers or feature classes and include all metadata for the Florida Keys reef system required for the performance of this Contract (ESRI Arc View?). The Contracting Officer shall, upon request of the interested contractor, provide the necessary items to respond to this request for quotes (RFQ). Before any items shall be released, a signed statement shall be provided in advance to the Contracting Officer that the contractor shall not use the data for any purposes other than for the performance of this contract.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>

Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

<DESC>REGION IVSTATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

Description, Purpose, and Background

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain engineering and mapping support that will allow FEMA Region IV to accomplish its? goals of implementing the Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization (Map Modernization) program.  FEMA's long-term objective for Map Modernization is for the entire U.S. population to have reliable digital flood hazard data and maps for flood-prone areas.  

FEMA's Mitigation Division manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the cornerstone of the nation's strategy for preparing communities for flood disasters.  The NFIP was created to reduce flood damage by identifying flood risks, encouraging sound floodplain management practices, and providing a mechanism through which people can insure their investments.  FEMA and its partners provide flood hazard data and maps to support flood insurance and floodplain management activities.  Map Modernization uses state-of-the-art technology, and engineering and digital mapping standards, to deliver reliable digital flood hazard data and maps in GIS format.  The national objectives of Map Modernization are as follows: 

1.  Establish and maintain a premier flood-hazard data collection and delivery system
FEMA will create a state-of-the-art, geospatial system that collects and maintains the best data available, integrates it into a national flood-layer theme, and provides easy access to reliable flood-hazard data and other information to support risk management applications and operations. 

2.  Build and maintain mutually beneficial partnerships
FEMA will foster mutually beneficial partnerships that achieve shared outcomes through the communication of flood risk and other hazards, and by improving the systems that support them.  Partnerships result in enhanced delivery of risk management applications and operations. Map Modernization includes innovative local, state, and Federal partnerships that use advanced technologies for determining and depicting flood hazards.  Map Modernization also includes improving E-Government processes for flood-hazard data collection and distribution.  Through this objective, FEMA intends to maximize the reuse of existing data and cost sharing in the collection of new data with local, state, and Federal partners. 

3.  Achieve effective program management
FEMA will develop and provide a sound program management structure that motivates partners to share responsibilities and aligns with partners' missions to reduce the Nation's vulnerability to floods and other hazards.  FEMA will develop and manage data quality standards and product specifications in a way that minimizes the complexity of the standards while maximizing interoperability of the data and systems. 

 
4.  Expand and better inform the user community
FEMA will foster public and stakeholder understanding of where to obtain flood and other hazard data, and how to use and analyze it in order to make sound decisions to reduce their vulnerability to natural and manmade hazards.

The Multi-Year Flood Hazard Identification Plan (MHIP) describes FEMA's strategy for updating flood maps used for NFIP purposes (http://www.fema.gov/fhm/mh_mhip.shtm).  It builds on the recommendations of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, and FEMA's objectives for Map Modernization.  It provides a five-year forecast of flood mapping activities and quality standards thereby enabling mapping partners and flood map users to better plan for map updates.

Statement of Objectives for this Procurement

This Statement of Objectives (SOO), applies to Region IV.  The overall objectives of this procurement are in support of the strategic goals of the Department of Homeland Security www.dhs.gov, the goals of FEMA?s Strategic Plan, www.fema.gov, the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (42 U.S.C. ??4101 et. seq.), the objectives of Map Modernization and the annual statement of priorities established pursuant thereto, www. http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/fhm/mm_main.shtm. 

The specific objectives for this procurement include the following:

1.  Region IV requires continuing contractor support to procure the capability to produce seamless county-wide DFIRMs including county-wide FIS reports, which meet the requirements of FEMA?s Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners, and the quality standards outlined in Procedural Memorandum No. 38 ? Implementation of Floodplain Boundry Standards (Section 7 of MHIP V1.0), for selected counties within its territory; to produce flood insurance studies (FIS); and, to produce disaster recovery maps.

2.  Region IV requires continuing contractual support to build and maintain mutually beneficial partnerships which includes the ability to assist and train mapping partners and stakeholders in the support functions and technical aspects of flood hazard mapping and DFIRM creation (e.g. Cooperating Technical Partner (CTP), and Map Modernization Management Support (MMMS) activities).

3.  Region IV requires continuing effective program management of its Map Modernization work, including work with the flood hazard data collection and delivery system requirements of FEMA Headquarters as identified in the Mapping Information Platform.  Elements of this objective include:

?	The need to track contractor costs and progress on tasks for the timely support of Data Management and Project Control using Earned Value Management techniques;  
?	The need to use FEMA?s Mapping Information Platform (MIP) to share management and flood-hazard data and store the products of tasks completed by contractors;
?	The need to have contractors generate products that are compatible with the mapping and engineering tools of the MIP; and, 
?	Work with flood-hazard data collection and delivery systems required of FEMA headquarters as identified in the MIP.

4.  The Region may require the contractor to respond in other regions nationwide.  In addition to disaster related taskings, this objective may encompasses taskings associated with the first three objectives for other FEMA Regions.

The above objectives encompass taskings, including, but not limited to:

?	Conducting reconnaissance of study area to determine/verify actual field conditions and generate data for studies, including field survey and the production of topographic map data by aerial procedures where necessary;
?	Conducting hydrologic and hydraulic modeling; 
?	Conduct hydrologic and hydraulic modeling for risk assessment purposes, which could include the use of automated procedures and geo-referenced database applications;  
?	Producing flood insurance study including NFIP digital maps suitable for publication in accordance with FEMA guidelines; 
?	Conducting riverine and coastal modeling for risk assessment purposes, which could include the use of automated procedures and geo-referenced database applications;  
?	Preparing study background material for archiving; 
?	Coordinate final documents with the National Service Provider (NSP) and administer a comments and appeals process;
?	Delivering services to review, revise and/or supplement Cooperative Technical Partners (CTP) products and flood study data developed by federal or state agencies; 
?	Providing disaster recovery maps in a timely manner that could include the use of automated procedures and geo-referenced database applications; and 
?	Attending meetings in various communities and/or FEMA facilities.

Constraints

The principal activities of the FEMA regional offices for which engineering and mapping support is needed are described in the Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners (http://www.fema.gov/fhm/gs_main.shtm). The Guidelines and Specifications... are organized into three volumes and 14 appendices as described below:

Volume 1 explains the activities involved in the completion of Flood Map Projects and provides guidelines for performing those activities in the following phases: 

	?  Mapping Needs Assessment
	?  Project Scoping
	?  Topographic and Flood Hazard Data Development
	?  Map and Report Production
	?  Preliminary/Post-Preliminary Processing

Volume 2 provides guidelines for the processing of revisions and amendments to Flood Hazard Maps initiated by communities and other Flood Hazard Mapping Partners, including the following: 

	?  Coastal Barrier Resources System revisions
	?  Letters of Map Amendment
	?  Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill
	?  Letters of Map Revision
	?  Physical Map Revisions

Volume 3 provides guidelines and specifications for support activities performed for FEMA by various Mapping Partners in the following general categories: 

	?  Program coordination
	?  Special technical and program support
	?  Public outreach activities
	?  Special correspondence support
	?  Post-flood hazard verification/recovery tools
	?  Hazard identification and mapping activities
	?  Other program support
 
Appendices provide additional guidelines and specifications for the processes and products covered in Volumes 1, 2, and 3. Appendices cover the following topics: 

	?  Aerial Mapping and Surveying, including LIDAR
	?  Converting to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 
	?  Riverine Flooding Analyses and Mapping
	?  Coastal Flooding Analyses and Mapping
	?  Shallow Flooding Analyses and Mapping
	?  Ice-Jam Analyses and Mapping
	?  Alluvial Fan Flooding Analyses and Mapping
	?  Mapping of Areas Protected by Levee Systems
	?  Project Scoping Toolbox
	?  Format and Specifications for Flood Insurance Study Reports
	?  Format and Specifications for Flood Insurance Rate Maps
	?  Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database
	?  Preparing and Maintaining Technical and Administrative Support Data
	?  Data Capture Standards and Data Capture Guidelines

Additionally procedural memoranda can be found at http://www.fema.gov/fhm/gs_memos.shtm  and are issued to: 
?	To implement updates to the Guidelines and the Document Control Procedures Manual; 
?	To provide additional clarification of procedures to be followed by FEMA, contractors, and Mapping Partners that are not documented in published guidance documents; and 
?	To establish procedures and policies for FEMA, contractors, and mapping partners

The MHIP details FEMA's 5-year plan for providing updated digital flood hazard data and maps for areas with flood risk. The completion of flood map updates initiated in the plan extends to 2010. This plan is revisited and updated yearly.  

Region IV requires the ability to enhance its capability to respond to disasters by accomplishing appropriate engineering studies and mapping on an accelerated schedule when needed. 

Region IV?s ability to achieve its? goals for the Map Modernization Program depend on the level of funding available.  Planned distributions of funds to the regions are addressed in Section 3 of the MHIP.

Region IV?s ability to achieve its? goals may be affected by the quality of related products produced by other mapping partners, and by the ability of other partners to meet delivery schedules.  

Contractors may be working with data that is restricted from release to the public.  This may include data that is protected by the Privacy Act.  Additionally, contractors may also be working with data (especially topographic data) that has either been acquired by FEMA or contributed by state or local partners. Be aware that some of this data is for flood hazard mapping work only and may be restricted to this defined purpose by licensing or subscription agreements.

Region IV will be working closely with FEMA?s National Service Provider (NSP) to achieve the goals of Map Modernization.  Contractors will also be required to work with the NSP to ensure that quality standards are met, to ensure that their work conforms to FEMA?s MIP, and to coordinate on other requirements.  A relationship should be established with the NSP to utilize the MIP and MIP tools to the maximum extent.

Contractors shall be responsible for meeting all quality standards outlined in both Chapter 7 of the Multi-Hazard Identification Plan, and all procedural memoranda issued (http://www.fema.gov/fhm/gs_memos.shtm), as of the date a Task order is awarded. 

Contractors must meet all appropriate State and Federal licensing and certification requirements for engineering, surveying, and mapping work.

The solution must address federal mandates regarding business practices, including, but not limited to: the Government Paperwork Elimination Act; the Government Information Security Reform Act; the Clinger-Cohen Act; the Government Performance and Results Act; the Federal Records Act; the Computer Security Act; the Freedom of Information Act; the Disabilities Act; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act; the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000; the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994; the Stafford Act; the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969; and other laws and regulations specific to FEMA.

Definitions

<DESC>This is a revised sources sought only seeking responses from Small Businesses?.
This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of the sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Businesses and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  Teaming is encouraged.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.   If you already responded to the Sources Sought dated 1/25/08 you do not need to submit another response.

Project Title has changed:  From  -- National and Regional System for the Application of Prevention Technologies (NR-SAPT) To ? Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT)

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to implement and manage the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT) to provide targeted training and technical assistance (T/TA) for grantees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), to implement all five steps and two cross-cutting principles of SAMHSA?s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) and accountability systems for performance measurement and management.  SAMHSA/CSAP grantees include:  States, Jurisdictions and Federally-recognized Tribal entities supported under SAMHSA?s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Program and  CSAP?s Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) including, but not limited to:  42 Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) Program grantees; approximately 150  Minority/AIDS/HIV Prevention Initiative grantees; approximately 12  Methamphetamine Prevention Initiative grantees; and, 23 epidemiological work groups supported by SAMHSA in non-SPF SIG States.

The focus of this procurement will be to develop, implement and manage a T/TA delivery system that balances core coordination and analytic capacity at the national level with service delivery capacity in each of the five designated regions of the National Prevention Network (NPN). 

The purpose of the national core of this system is to provide centralized direction, monitoring of service quality and responsiveness to clients, evaluation of service impacts, coordination and analytic capabilities. The national core will connect to five separate Regionally-based Expert Teams to establish a coordinated training and technical assistance system aimed at building the capacity of SAMHSA/CSAP grantees and the capabilities of the prevention workforce.    The purpose of the Regionally-based Expert Teams is to conduct ongoing assessment of the T/TA needs of the SAMHSA/CSAP grantees located within each respective Region and deliver targeted and timely T/TA services to assist grantees in achieving their specific program objectives and benchmarks.  Regionally-based expert teams will consist of staff, associates, and consultants who are currently established in their respective Regions and have existing professional T/TA relationships with those States, Jurisdictions, Tribal organizations and other relevant entities within the Region.

Air Force Research Laboratory
Space Vehicles Directorate

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in space and missile technology; specifically, in the Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS): The Alternative Infrared Satellite System (AIRSS) program is being managed by the Developmental Planning Directorate of the Air Force Space and Missile Command (SMC/XR).  AIRSS is a parallel program to the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) High geosynchronous satellite number 3 (GEO 3).  The decision to produce GEO 3 or AIRSS will be dependent on developmental success of the geosynchronous satellites, and the technical maturity demonstrated by AIRSS.  The decision is expected to be made in FY08.

To help support the FY08 decision gate, the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is executing Risk Reduction for the Alternative Infrared Satellite System (RR-AIRSS) under SMC/XR support.  The overarching goal of RR-AIRSS is to raise the maturity of the critical technologies through component and system-level performance test, environmental test and flight qualification.  The goal of RR-AIRSS is to produce the quantitative data needed to define a highly-reliable AIRSS Program Baseline for Functional Design, Budget, and Schedule and enable a low-risk on-ramp into SBIRS if needed.  The RR-AIRSS is soliciting proposals in 2 general areas: 

Topic 1.  Integrated AIRSS Payload Experiments:  Candidate infrared (IR) payloads will be assembled from components with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and seek quantitative systems-level verification through ground performance and environmental test.  The integrated payloads will be tested for performance comparison to SBIRS and DSP-like requirements.   The integrated payloads will be fully flight-qualified through environmental testing focused on vibration, shock, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  This approach is designed to offer the most iron-clad risk reduction for AIRSS, as opposed to striving for the greatest possible payload performance.

Topic 2.  Critical AIRSS Component Development:  Design work under Topic 1 is expected to identify key areas where technology development at the component level will have major impact on the systems-level performance of the integrated payload.  Topic 2 will solicit proposals at the component level for technology development and component-level flight qualification.  Component level elements of primary interest include, but are not limited to, large area focal plane arrays, cryocoolers, advanced data processing hardware and algorithms, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) telescopes.  The goal of efforts funded under Topic 2 will be to provide quantitative data or demonstrated capability needed to include the component in an integrated payload.  Where applicable, components should be environmentally tested for suitability in a flight system.

This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN.  Specific security guidance can be addressed to the Security Point of Contact listed below. This acquisition involves data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and RR-AIRSS technical data are subject to export controls. All prospective offerors shall have appropriate clearances to participate in this acquisition.  The availability and commitment of adequately cleared personnel, required facilities, automated information system (AIS) and communications to support the effort in a timely and acceptable manner at the appropriate level of classification is required.

<DESC>REGION IVSTATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

Description, Purpose, and Background

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain engineering and mapping support that will allow FEMA Region IV to accomplish its? goals of implementing the Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization (Map Modernization) program.  FEMA's long-term objective for Map Modernization is for the entire U.S. population to have reliable digital flood hazard data and maps for flood-prone areas.  

FEMA's Mitigation Division manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the cornerstone of the nation's strategy for preparing communities for flood disasters.  The NFIP was created to reduce flood damage by identifying flood risks, encouraging sound floodplain management practices, and providing a mechanism through which people can insure their investments.  FEMA and its partners provide flood hazard data and maps to support flood insurance and floodplain management activities.  Map Modernization uses state-of-the-art technology, and engineering and digital mapping standards, to deliver reliable digital flood hazard data and maps in GIS format.  The national objectives of Map Modernization are as follows: 

1.  Establish and maintain a premier flood-hazard data collection and delivery system
FEMA will create a state-of-the-art, geospatial system that collects and maintains the best data available, integrates it into a national flood-layer theme, and provides easy access to reliable flood-hazard data and other information to support risk management applications and operations. 

2.  Build and maintain mutually beneficial partnerships
FEMA will foster mutually beneficial partnerships that achieve shared outcomes through the communication of flood risk and other hazards, and by improving the systems that support them.  Partnerships result in enhanced delivery of risk management applications and operations. Map Modernization includes innovative local, state, and Federal partnerships that use advanced technologies for determining and depicting flood hazards.  Map Modernization also includes improving E-Government processes for flood-hazard data collection and distribution.  Through this objective, FEMA intends to maximize the reuse of existing data and cost sharing in the collection of new data with local, state, and Federal partners. 

3.  Achieve effective program management
FEMA will develop and provide a sound program management structure that motivates partners to share responsibilities and aligns with partners' missions to reduce the Nation's vulnerability to floods and other hazards.  FEMA will develop and manage data quality standards and product specifications in a way that minimizes the complexity of the standards while maximizing interoperability of the data and systems. 

 
4.  Expand and better inform the user community
FEMA will foster public and stakeholder understanding of where to obtain flood and other hazard data, and how to use and analyze it in order to make sound decisions to reduce their vulnerability to natural and manmade hazards.

The Multi-Year Flood Hazard Identification Plan (MHIP) describes FEMA's strategy for updating flood maps used for NFIP purposes (http://www.fema.gov/fhm/mh_mhip.shtm).  It builds on the recommendations of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, and FEMA's objectives for Map Modernization.  It provides a five-year forecast of flood mapping activities and quality standards thereby enabling mapping partners and flood map users to better plan for map updates.

Statement of Objectives for this Procurement

This Statement of Objectives (SOO), applies to Region IV.  The overall objectives of this procurement are in support of the strategic goals of the Department of Homeland Security www.dhs.gov, the goals of FEMA?s Strategic Plan, www.fema.gov, the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (42 U.S.C. ??4101 et. seq.), the objectives of Map Modernization and the annual statement of priorities established pursuant thereto, www. http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/fhm/mm_main.shtm. 

The specific objectives for this procurement include the following:

Teaming is encouraged.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.   If you already responded to the Sources Sought dated 1/25/08 you do not need to submit another response.

Project Title has changed:  From  -- National and Regional System for the Application of Prevention Technologies (NR-SAPT) To ? Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT)

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to implement and manage the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT) to provide targeted training and technical assistance (T/TA) for grantees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), to implement all five steps and two cross-cutting principles of SAMHSA?s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) and accountability systems for performance measurement and management.  SAMHSA/CSAP grantees include:  States, Jurisdictions and Federally-recognized Tribal entities supported under SAMHSA?s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Program and  CSAP?s Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) including, but not limited to:  42 Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) Program grantees; approximately 150  Minority/AIDS/HIV Prevention Initiative grantees; approximately 12  Methamphetamine Prevention Initiative grantees; and, 23 epidemiological work groups supported by SAMHSA in non-SPF SIG States.

The focus of this procurement will be to develop, implement and manage a T/TA delivery system that balances core coordination and analytic capacity at the national level with service delivery capacity in each of the five designated regions of the National Prevention Network (NPN).

The national core will connect to five separate Regionally-based Expert Teams to establish a coordinated training and technical assistance system aimed at building the capacity of SAMHSA/CSAP grantees and the capabilities of the prevention workforce.    The purpose of the Regionally-based Expert Teams is to conduct ongoing assessment of the T/TA needs of the SAMHSA/CSAP grantees located within each respective Region and deliver targeted and timely T/TA services to assist grantees in achieving their specific program objectives and benchmarks.  Regionally-based expert teams will consist of staff, associates, and consultants who are currently established in their respective Regions and have existing professional T/TA relationships with those States, Jurisdictions, Tribal organizations and other relevant entities within the Region.
