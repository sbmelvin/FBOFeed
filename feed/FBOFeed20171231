<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to synopsize the Security Support Services (SSS) requirement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.207. <br /><br />Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to issue a solicitation for for guard and protective security services in support of numerous agencies under the Department of Defense (DoD). To accomplish its objectives, the DoD intends to award up to five, Private Security Companies (PSC) contracts to support peace and stability initiatives in areas of armed conflict, post conflict, and comparable situations. Where Military or other U.S. Government (USG) security forces are unavailable, insufficient, or inappropriate, PSCs shall provide relief protection, recovery, and reconstruction activities from theft, extortion, vandalism, terrorism, and other unlawful violence. Effective discipline, training, and oversight of USG contracted PSCs build the confidence of the local population, reduce the risk of civilians and civilian activities becoming Military targets, and support the restoration of the rule of law. In order to accommodate this objective the Performance Based Work Statement (PWS) provides a full spectrum of private security functions for the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) and other Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Combatant Commands (COCOMS). It is estimated that solicitation W52P1J-17-R-0111 will be issued in January 2018. However, this date is subject to change. Further notices, as applicable, will provide updates of the anticipated solicitation release date. <br /><br />ACC-RI intends to conduct a full and open, best value tradeoff competition to award Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Task Order Contracts awarded to awardees (up to five) determined to provide the best value to the Government. The maximum award amount for this acquisition is $4,000,000,000.00 (cumulative of all resulting contracts) for five one-year ordering periods and the option to extend for an additional six months under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. Additionally, FAR 52.237-3, Continuity of Services, will be included in the contract. <br /><br />The successful Offeror(s) for this acquisition will be required to support the DoD with commercial provided services that include all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, and other services necessary to perform the requirements defined within the PWS. <br /><br />A draft PWS was issued to gauge the interest level of industry in fulfilling the requirements for SSS. These announcements were posted to www.fbo.gov on 27 March 2017 and on 13 September 2017.
<p>A draft Solicitation was posted to www.fbo.gov on 29 November 2017, along with an updated draft PWS, responses to previous industry questions, and other supporting documents. This was to allow for potential Offerors to become more familiar with the scope, complexity, and nature of the requirements prior to final solicitation release.

<p>COR Contact. Hector Socias, 706-485-7110 ext. 107. Kelvin Jackson, 706-584-7110 ext 118.</p>
<p>Acreage. Acreage listed in the table was determined by Global Position System (GPS) and is <br />considered actual acreage and not an estimate.</p>
<p>Boundaries. Where a district stand change doesn't exist along boundary, boundaries will be marked with orange paint or flagging on perimeter trees and brush facing into the work areas.</p>
<p><br />1.3 Order of Work</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to determine the sequence of the areas worked. The Estimated date for starting work will be on or after January 10, 2018. The contract duration will be for 60 days and should be completed by March 15, 2018.</p>
<p><br />1.4 Contractor Furnished Property</p>
<p><br />The Government shall deliver the following materials, supplies, and property at the place and time specified below.</p>
<p>1. Seedlings. Containerized Longleaf pine seedlings will be furnished in sealed bags, bales, or bundles. Contractor shall be responsible for loading and transporting seedlings from the storage site to the planting site. Seedlings will be considered delivered to the Contractor when the Contractor loads seedlings on his vehicle for transporting to planting sites.</p>
<p>Seedlings may only be picked up during the specified hours and days. Not more than one day's supply of seedlings may be picked up on any one day, except a two day supply may be picked up on Friday or the day preceding a Federal holiday.</p>
<p><br />Storage Site: Pickup Time:</p>
<p>Oconee District Work Center 7:30 A.M. to 8:30 A.M.<br />Monday through Friday<br />excluding Federal holiday.</p>
<p>No more than one-day supply of seedlings can be picked up on any one day, except a two-day supply may be picked up on a Friday or the day preceding a Federal Holiday.<br />The contractor will plant all trees picked up from refrigerated storage within twenty-four hours of accepting seedlings, unless otherwise agreed to by the Forest service. When the Forest Service determines that conditions are unsuitable for planting, the Contractor will return unplanted trees to the refrigerated storage unit for delay.<br />Seedlings are perishable and have limited viability during storage. Survival of seedlings is greatly reduced when stored for too long. Seedlings stored beyond 21 days are considered unacceptable planting stock. The Contractor will be responsible for coordinating and estimating seedling needs based on crew size and order seedlings accordingly. The Contractor will be responsible for the cost of replacing expired seedlings (stored for more than 21 days) when seedlings have been ordered and stored based on contractor's schedule but were not planted prior to their storage expiration date, when within the Contractor's control. Seedling cost is shown in section 332.<br />2. Crew Organization. The contractor shall provide a competent foreman for each crew. A crew should not exceed 7 people. The foreman shall be with the crew at all times while they are working. Each crew will perform work as an individual working unit and during normal work operations will not be separated into smaller working groups, unless agreed to by Forest Service. If Contractor continues to employ a planter who continually mishandles or improperly plants seedlings, a Suspend Work Order may be issued for the entire crew.<br />C.02 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>2.1 Planting Conditions<br />Seedlings may be planted any time weather conditions are satisfactory based on the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Ground not frozen<br />&bull; Air temperature between 32 degrees and 75 degrees F.<br />&bull; Winds less than 15 MPH disregarding occasional gusts.</p>
<p>2.2- Spacing</p>
<p>Plant containerized seedlings at the spacing designated for the area (shown on attached table) to achieve the prescribed stocking level. Plant trees evenly over the entire area in identifiable rows. Vary spacing when necessary due to ground conditions provided however tree seedlings must be planted within a tolerance not to exceed 10 percent plus or minus the prescribed trees per acre. Minimum and maximum trees planted per acre are based on properly planted seedlings. When planting longleaf, try and space the new trees between the already existing longleaf. You can ignore the loblolly pine, as these will likely die in subsequent burning.</p>
<p>Stocking Level - tree per acre<br />Designated Minimum-- Maximum<br />Spacing (see Prescribed 10% below 10% above<br />Area Table) (Rx) Rx level Rx level</p>
<p>8 x 8 689 620 758<br /><br />NOTE: All seedlings will be planted on 8 X 8 ft spacing. Sites are previous pine beetle outbreaks areas that have been salvaged. There are some areas inhabited by existing planted longleaf and loblolly pine vegetation. Contractors are to plant within these areas and between existing pine vegetation. Any additional Site-specific information may be obtained from the Contracting Officer Representative contact in Section 1.2.</p>
<p>2.3 - Un-plantable Seedlings</p>
<p>Seedlings furnished will be "bed-run" and will contain an unknown amount of Un-plantable seedlings. Un-plantable seedlings include seedlings without lateral roots, roots less than 6 inches, stem diameter less than 1/8 inch, stems less than 6 inches, and broken stems.</p>
<p>Un-plantable seedlings are NOT to be planted. Any un-plantable seedling used will be counted as improperly planted.</p>
<p>Do not sort or cull seedlings prior to actual planting time. Cull un-plantable seedlings only when the individual seedling is removed from the planter's bag for planting. At that time, drop the un-plantable seedling on the ground. Unusual amounts of plantable seedlings that are discarded will be counted as wasted seedlings. A payment deduction will be made in accordance with Section 332.</p>
<p>2.4 - Pruning</p>
<p>Seedling roots shall NOT be pruned or cut by the contractor.</p>
<p>2.5 - Planting Instructions</p>
<p>2.51 General Instructions</p>
<p>One seedling will be planted per trash-free hole.</p>
<p>A trash-free hole for planting may be created only after the area has been cleared of surface debris to the extent that when the planting hole is created no debris can fall into the hole preventing an air tight seal. Trash such as leaves, litter, duff, etc. will be removed in the area surrounding the planting hole.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall supply the planting tools appropriate to the plug length being planted.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted if ground is frozen or if air temperature is below 32 degree F, or if the air temperature is above 75 degree F, unless otherwise agreed to by the Forest Service.</p>
<p>Soil moisture must be present to a depth of six inches.<br />Plant seedlings in a manner to prevent twisting of roots, "L" roots, "J" roots, or balled roots. <br />Seedlings should be firmly packed around the roots to eliminate air pockets and ensure the entire root system is in contact with the soil without damaging the seedling.<br />All planting spots in and adjacent to surface obstructions such as windrows, tree tops, ad or rocks will be planted. All along log landings and skid trails shall be planted unless directed by Forest Service not to.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted within the clearing limits of any designated system road or powerline right-of-way or within fifteen feet of a fence, existing tree line, or designated property boundaries.</p>
<p>Do not plant seedlings in standing water.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted within 12 inches of large mounds of dirt, or stump holes large enough to hamper root growth of seedling.</p>
<p>Seedlings will not be culled in the field without agreement by the Forest Service. The following criteria shall be used to determine if a seedling is un-plantable:</p>
<p>Minimum Quality Measure<br />Needles: 6-10 inches if clipped; 8-12 inches unclipped;<br />Dark green in color</p>
<p>Roots: Root collar diameter at least &frac14; inch; root light brown with numerous white tips; lateral roots abundant</p>
<p>Plug Firmness: Stay intact when extracted and when handled; remain firm when held horizontal</p>
<p>Plug Moisture: Plug has always remained moist</p>
<p>Pest: No presence of weeds or pests</p>
<p>Winter Buds: Present</p>
<p>In addition, seedlings with forked tops, have evidence of disease or other undesirable traits will not be planted. Un-plantable seedlings are NOT to be planted. Any un-plantable seedling used will be counted as improperly planted.</p>
<p>Do not sort or cull seedlings prior to actual planting time. Cull un-plantable seedlings only when the individual seedling is removed from the planter's bag for planting. At that time, drop the un-plantable seedling on the ground. Unusual amounts of plantable seedlings that are discarded will be counted as wasted seedlings and subjected to financial penalties.<br />2.52 Detailed Instructions</p>
<p>Correct planting of containerized seedlings, step by step, is as follows:<br />Step 1 At the proper spacing within the row, pick a location and scalp (remove leaves, litter, duff, etc.) a suitable planting spot to mineral soil;<br />Step 2 Insert the entire usable tip of the planting tool straight down into the soil at the center of the planting spot;<br />Step 3 Place the containerized seedling in the hole so that the root collar is located at the ground level but not more than &frac12; inch below the scalped ground level; ensure that the terminal bud is equal to or slightly above the surface of the scalped ground. Do not shake off or remove soil that is contained within the seedling plug.<br />Step 4 After inserting and compressing the tree seedling, fill depression with &frac12; of soil to cover the growing medium at the top of the root plug, This will prevent the root mass from "wicking" or drying out . This step is essential for satisfactory planting. Be careful not to step on the seedling during this operation.<br />2.6 - Care and Handling of Seedlings</p>
<p>The Contractor must protect the seedlings and take precautions to prevent damage to them from the time they are received by the Contractor until they are planted. This shall include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Seedlings shall be protected at all times from drying, heating, smothering, freezing, crushing, drowning, abrasion, rapid temperature fluctuations or contact with injurious substances, i.e. gasoline, oil, or diesel fuel.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings must be kept in the shade in the open air while in the field. The Contractor will provide, as a minimum, a light colored, heat reflective tarpaulin to cover seedlings during transport and field storage. Seedlings shall not be stored in a closed vehicle.</p>
<p>Do not build a warming fire within 100 feet of area where seedlings are stored or handled.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings should not be thrown, stepped on, sat on, or otherwise abused at any time.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings must stay sealed prior to planting, and only one box/bag/bundle shall be open at a time. Quickly remove only enough seedlings to fill planting bags to be carried by planters; seedlings should not be exposed to the elements for more than two minutes. Partial boxes/bags/bundles must be resealed to prevent moisture loss using a clamp, cord or by other effective means. Damaged or torn boxes/bags. Bundles must be immediately repaired to prevent moisture loss.</p>
<p>Planters shall not carry more than a one-hour supply of seedlings in their seedling bags. Planting bags should not be over-filled to the point where "packing" occurs.</p>
<p>Contractors supplied planting bags to be carried by planters, shall be of a light color, should not retain water or heat, have a minimum depth of 15 inches, be free of defects or contaminates, and should be constructed to allow easy and unrestricted extraction of tree seedlings, one at a time. Planters shall not carry any seedlings in their hands between planting spots. Seedlings should only be removed from the planting bag when a hole for the seedling has been made.</p>
<p>If any of the conditions are outside of the following range of preferred weather conditions, then the Contractor will take additional precautionary measures as directed by the Forest Service when handling, transporting, and while on site in the project area:</p>
<p>Air Temperature: 33 - 75 degrees F <br />Relative Humidity: 30 - 50 percent <br />Wind Speed: no more than 15 miles per hour</p>
<p>All seedling bags, wrappers, boxes, empty container or other debris resulting from the Contractor's planting activity shall be removed from the project area and transported back to the Forest Service Work Center for proper disposal.</p>
<p>2.4 Equipment Requirements</p>
<p>Equipment used must be a dibble bar style plug cutter, not a solid shank, capable of creating a hole that containerized seedlings can be planted in as described previously in section 2.52 Detailed Instructions. Hodads, sticker bars or any other similar planting tools will not be permitted for use.</p>
<p>2.5 Access</p>
<p>Any vehicular use of closed roads must be approved by the COR. The contractor is responsible<br />for repair of any damage (rutting, excessive soil exposure, etc.) caused by vehicles.</p>
<p>2.6 Debris Removal<br /><br />All slash deposited by the contract crew(s) shall be removed from all roads within and out of the project areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.03 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for inspecting his own work and correcting any deficiencies (reference FAR Clause 52.246-4 Inspection of Services). Government inspections are for the purpose of determining areas accepted for payment. Government Inspection of work performance under this contract shall be made by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or the designated inspector as the work progresses at such intervals as are necessary to insure compliance with the contract specifications and provisions.</p>
<p>All contract areas will be sampled to determine the number of seedlings properly and improperly planted. Sampling will consist of 1/100th acre plots taken at a minimum rate of one per acre on a grid basis over the entire area. Natural seedlings and seedlings planted in a previous season will not be counted. The total number of properly planted seedlings per acre will be derived from the average of the results of the sample plots taken in the area.<br />Upon completion of work on an area, the contractor shall notify the COR that work on the area is completed and the COR shall make an overall inspection of the work completed. If the work completed is accepted, the Contractor shall proceed with work on the next area. If the work is not accepted by the COR, the Contractor shall complete any remedial work required prior to commencing work on the next area.</p>
<p>An area will be accepted for payment when the number of property reported seedlings per acre is between the minimum and the maximum number for the designated spacing as shown in Section 220. The spacing seedlings must also be adequately uniform over the entire contract area before the area will be accepted.</p>
<p>3.1 Unsatisfactory Work</p>
<p>In the event any or the work does not meet the specifications through the fault or negligence of<br />the Contractor, such work shall, upon request of the COR, be made to conform to specifications<br />by the Contractor at his expense. Cost of re-inspection by the Government will be charged to the<br />Contractor.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
