<DESC>The Departmen of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to make a time and materials, sole source award to IHS International.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a contract in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for certain Commericial Itemsd.  This non-comptitive action is being issed by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Department of Defense, OSD/Net Assessment.  It is the intent of the Director, net assessment  to award a three-year contract (base period through 30 Sept. 2004) and two, twelve month option periods. 3.	Description of Supplies or Services.  This project is for a 3-year series of social-economic reports about China, and its evolving domestic, regional and global 21st Century wherewithal will employ IHSI's non-conventional approach to situational assessments.  In order to proceed with an understanding of the complexities surrounding China's development today, it is necessary to have access to public domain and open source information from several perspectives - government; business sector; middle class entrepreneurs and professionals; and international participants in trade with China. All contact to support the research of this collection of studies will be open source, but the final assessments may in fact be source and government sensitive.     IHS International has access to former, present and next generation contacts in the Government of China.  Central amongst these is the research institute within the Party University of the CCP Central Committee, and through this institute access to central Party and State officials in the Central, provincial and municipal governments. The center point of development guidance of Chinese national interests and objectives is the Party University of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The Party University faculty and researchers are responsible for leading the evolution of the CCP in a manner that will retain relevance to ideological purpose, and more importantly, maintain Party legitimacy for a majority of the population. China's embracing of democratic principles of governance will arrive sooner than many expect, and the Party University is charged with upholding the balance of both sides of the equal sign in this very sophisticated boundary value problem (both sides of the equation with multiple variables). The Party University is charged with providing post-graduate education and certification to new generations of top-level Party officials and civil servants, and they are responsible for conveying the knowledge.  Through IHSI's work in consulting international corporations on project and market development in China, contact and relationships are maintained with a large multi-functional network of both State Owned and private industries in China.  Through this continuing work, IHSI is able to watch carefully the interplay between the SOEs, private entrepreneurs, traditional 'families' and state regulators concerning financing and overall business development. The effort to be performed by IHS International will enable OSD/Net Assessment to meet our requirements to conduct research and analysis on future military organizations. The contractor will leverage its unique competencies in net assessment, political-military affairs and a wide spectrum of infrastructure disciplines to provide a comprehensive and actionable study with great relevance to Department of Defense strategic planning.   The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This in NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Department of the Interior; Attention: James E.

<CONTACT>Mathew A. Ridolfi Contract Specialist 7037871813     Mathew.Ridolfi@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Norden Millimeter Inc. Placerville, CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement for the acquisition of 91 Ka Band Up-Converters.  The estimated total value of this project is $360,000.  The Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has the requirement to build a Ka Band Millimeter Wave (MMW) Scene Generation System for use in the Advanced Multispectral Simulation, Test & Acceptance Resource (AMSTAR).  The Ka Band MMW Scene Generator is a specialized development whose requirements are being driven by the weapon system Joint Common Modular Missile (JCMM).  JCMM's MMW requirements are of the highest technical challenges.  This procurement is a core piece to the MMW Scene Generator and in turn has very stringent technical requirements. Norden Millimeter is the only vendor with the ability to produce an Up-Converter to meet AMSTAR's challenging requirements.  In addition to being capable of meeting the specifications, Norden Millimeter is the only vendor that can likely produce and deliver the up-converters in the required timeframe to meet the JCMM schedule.  The AMSTAR Ka Performance Hardware-in-the-Loop Facility is required to be operational in the second quarter of FY05 in order to test one of the first engineering development units of the Joint Common Modular Missile (JCMM).  Testing at this facility is in the direct path to Milestone-C for the JCMM program.  In order to allow time for integrating the up-converters and perform necessary troubleshooting and calibration units must start arriving in the third quarter of FY04 and must all be delivered by the end of first quarter of FY05.  To compete this action and qualify another vendor would require the vendor demonstrate the ability to meet the stringent requirements for the up-converter.  It is conservatively estimated that it would take a minimum of one half man-year of effort for another vendor to produce an up-converter capable of meeting government requirements and increase the cost substantially.  This added timeframe would jeopardize planned test conduct for the JCMM.  There is no other known vendor that can perform this requirement without a duplication of effort, time, and cost.  Award to any source other than Norden Millimeter would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST April 16, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is requesting proposals for the integrated development of electronic technologies and components compatible with future generation multifunctional electromagnetic systems designed in a manner consistent with the Navy’s Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency Concept (AMRF-C) and emphasizing significant cost reduction.  AMRF-C program supports the Fleet Force Protection (FFP) Future Naval Capability (FNC).  In addition, the FFP FNC also supports various systems that are intended to address operation gaps in Naval systems.  Such systems require 2-D electromagnetic arrays operating at microwave frequencies to support multiple simultaneous functions selected from the Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications classes with primary emphasis on 6-18 GHz EW capability and secondary emphasis on communications functions within the same spectrum.  

This announcement seeks innovative means of dramatically reducing the cost of both transmit and receive antenna elements in electronically (digitally) steered antenna arrays.  Among the aspects to be considered are innovations in architecture, materials, and overall electronic and mechanical integration and packaging.  This announcement does not seek single/selected innovations that may further complicate other aspects or components of the overall objective; rather, it seeks integration of the whole at substantially reduced cost. The Full BAA Announcement is available on the ONR Homepage at www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa/.

Incidental Visitor Services include the sale of beverages,   sunscreen, insect repellent, and limited camping supplies. One contract   will be issued for these services. This operation is seasonal in nature  with the season beginning mid-May and ending mid-October.  The new contract  requires that services be provided for a minimum of two hours, five   evenings a week. Schedule of operation must be consistent and must include  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings. The offeror may propose the  contract term (5 to 10 years). This option has no scoring value in the   selection of proposals. This flexibility is intended to broaden this   solicitation to entities and individuals who have not operated in the unique   conditions of the Monument (location, travel time, minimal hours, fire   restrictions, etc.). The current concession authorization expired December 31, 2003. The current operator has no right of preference in renewal. The annual gross receipts over the past 5 years averaged $12,635.  The methods used to provide these services have varied during these 5 years from on-site personnel providing full services resulting in gross receipts of $20,056 to only self-serve beverage service  resulting in gross receipts of $5,957.  The prospectus will be issued April 1, 2004, for a 30-day response period.  Offers for this prospectus must be received by close of business (no later than 4 p.m.) on April 30, 2004, in the Business Resources Division(IMR-CM)(GRSAPROP), National Park Service, Intermountain Region, PO Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225-0287 (Federal Express address: 12795 W.

The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.

In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

<DESC>Request for Information
HSTS01-04-AOP999:

Air Cargo Freight Assessment
PHASE I

April 9, 2004

INTRODUCTION:

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in gathering information from Industry regarding air cargo authentication.  The Government is contemplating methods to determine how to further develop air cargo security.  Companies are invited to submit their ideas on air cargo security and may be invited to an industry forum in the future.  Air Cargo often travels by highway, rail, and ocean before being transported by air.  Therefore, inputs are not limited to the aviation industry.

This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  Do not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI are presumptively considered Security Sensitive Information (SSI) and will be handled as such.  

INFORMATION REQUESTED:

1.	What risks have you identified pre-9/11 and post-9/11 and what are the operational issues identified with those risks?
2.	What processes have been implemented or are available that can mitigate the risks identified in Item 1?
3.	What sources of data are available, and are they commercial or proprietary?
4.	What analysis has been completed to validate the data referenced in Item 3?
5.	Address known emerging technologies and feasibility studies or analyses.  
6.	What approach do you recommend for the Government to further develop an air cargo freight assessment program?

RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:

Do not submit unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI – they will not be considered.  Responses should not exceed twenty (20) pages and should be submitted not later than 4:00 p.m. (EST), Friday, April 30, 2004.  Submissions should be sent electronically to Heather.Morvant@dhs.gov, or hand-carried to Heather Morvant at 701 S. 12th Street, Arlington, VA  22202 via the Visitor’s Center.  Ms. Morvant may be reached at (571) 227-1592, or contact Susan Minson at (571) 227-3202 for pickup from the Visitor’s Center.  Questions may be directed to Heather Morvant at the same email address or phone number.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), Bethesda, MD intends to award on a sole source, cost/no-fee contract to Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA., to determine whether the new drug product 5-Androstenediol (5-AED) has protective effects against the hematopoietic damage caused by ionizing radiation in Non-Human Primates (NHP).  This contract will be awarded in accordance with the authority permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(2) and 6.302-3(a)(2)(b)(ii) and the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between AFRRI and Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This project is being conducted in support of research into the radioprotective properties of androst-5-ene-3&#946;, 17&#946;-diol (5-AED) and related steroids, which is an integral mission of the Radiation Casualty Management (RCM) Team at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI). For ethical reasons, this drug cannot undergo efficacy trials in humans since the proposed indication for use is the prevention of mortality from lethal ionizing radiation. The FDA-accepted alternative is described in the new Animal Efficacy Rule (21 CFR Parts 314 and 601; FDA 31May2002). In compliance with this Rule, the contractor will demonstrate the efficacy of this drug product in preventing and/or ameliorating radiation induced morbidity in and enhancing survival of rhesus macaques (non-human primates, NHP). The contractor will select an appropriate NHP experimental model of radiation protection to be used to support FDA submissions for a radioprotectant using 5-AED. This model system will be used for all 3 studies listed below. In addition, the product formulation used in these studies will be the formulation that will be used in subsequent Phase I clinical safety and dosing trials. 1) The contractor will identify the optimal dosing schedule for the product that provides effective radiation protection; 2) The contractor will determine whether amelioration of febrile neutropenia can be used as a surrogate marker for enhancement of survival; 3) The contractor will demonstrate radioprotective efficacy of 5-AED as appropriate to support the FDA requirements under the Animal Efficacy Rule. The Contractor shall submit formal written interim progress reports every three (3) months during the award period of performance to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) that sets forth the technical progress made and that identifies any problems that may have been encountered. These reports should also identify any goals and objectives requiring further effort. In addition, the Contractor shall exchange informal interim updates from time to time as reasonably requested by the COR. The Contractor shall submit a final report to the COR of the results of the activities conducted by the Contractor during the period of performance within one (1) month after completing the projects described above. The format of the final report shall be standard research report format. The report will be prepared and edited under the guidance of the (COR) and the Contractors Regulatory Affairs staff. A copy of the report will be provided to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and the Contracting Officer. As appropriate, the reports submitted and the data generated from the studies will be used to support FDA submissions for an IND application for 5-AED. The contractor shall provide administrative support as required to ensure successful completion of contract requirements. The contractor shall initiate and administer the appropriate subcontracts with a laboratory equipped to perform good laboratory practice (GLP) studies on NHP to carry out the objectives. 2) Shall coordinate between the subcontractor and AFRRI to carry out the necessary irradiations of NHP in the AFRRI Cobalt Facility. 3) Shall obtain all data from the subcontractor, perform the appropriate statistical analyses, and provide periodic scientific reports to the COR. The Government will provide whole-body gamma-irradiation of NHP brought to AFRRI by the contractor for that purpose, and will also provide the required radiation dosimetry. The Government will provide oversight by the AFRRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The COR or Government personnel associated with the project will also provide weekly or daily guidance to the contractor personnel as needed. The place of performance will be at the contractor’s headquarters (administration and analysis), the subcontractor’s GLP facility (all aspects of experimentation except for irradiations), and AFRRI (irradiations). The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with the option to extend services for four additional one-year periods. The contractor is not authorized travel and per diem expenses under the terms and conditions of this contract. The following provisions apply to this acquisition: FAR CLAUSES and PROVISIONS: 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment (FEB 2002), 52.216-11, Cost Contract - No Fee (APR 1984), 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000), 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (FEB 1999); 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (APR 1984); 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era Veterans (APR 1998); 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998); 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era (JAN 1999); 52.225-3, Buy American Act Supplies (JAN 1994); 52.225-13 Restrictions on certain Foreign Purchases (FEB 2000); 52.225-21, Buy American Act North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act Balance of Payments Program (JAN 1997); 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer Central Contractor Registration (May 1999); 52.239-1, Privacy or Security Safeguards (AUG 1996).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The proposed effort is for the acquisition of 298 each Auxiliary Power Unit Power Take-Off  (APU/PTO) Clutches, Part Number 3617950-1, NSN:  3010-01-515-8483, applicable to the AH-64 Apache helicopter with option of 224 each. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, entitled Only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency require ments. The proposed acquisition is limited to Honeywell International Inc., Defense & Space, Commercial and Government Entity Code 02LU7, (99193) facility code, 1300 West Warner Road, PO Box 22200, Tempe, AZ  85285-2200. As sole manufacturer and design authority of the AH-64 Apache APU, Honeywell maintains the exclusive engineering, design, manufacturing, and test expertise associated with the APU PTO Clutch. Due to the safety of flight issues associated with the legacy AP U clutch, it has been determined to be in the best interest of the Government to replace all existing clutches with the newly designed APU/PTO clutch.  Because AMCOM Integrated Material Management Center cannot support this effort with the redesigned clutc h in a timely matter, it is imperative that the Government obtain the new redesigned clutch by the most expeditious means available.  Initial U.S. Army assets will be made available through existing contract requirements contained in the R&S/Recap contract  for 341 each, APU/PTO replacement clutches.  In order to force retrofit the remaining U.S. Army fleet, 251 additional clutches require accelerated delivery.  Direct procurement from Honeywell vice acceleration of current contract options is the most  econ omical and advantageous means of acquisition.   Interested parties should identify themselves in writing to the Contracting Officer.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by this agency.  See Note 22.

USSOCOM is interested in contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and fabrication of these compone nt items that may eventually be used in the manufacture of next generation environmental protective garments.    The government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria.  Furth er, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field up to 10,000 systems, which incorporate these component items, meet military operational needs.  Vendors must have adequate fabrication and test facilities to warrant pre-production testing and limited procurement of component items.  Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide a working hardware ready for test and demonstration purposes on or about 01 November 2004 and capable of providing product(s) which are an impro vement over current commonly used technologies meeting at least one of the following requirements without trading off performance from the current base line:  1) ability to keep the user dry 2) regulate body temperature 3) increase user comfort 4) increase  garment durability 5) increase user range of motion or 6) reduce noise in an operational environment.    Responses to this market survey are due on or before 1 July 2004, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement r egarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.

<DESC>Deployable Structures Experiment (DSX) Host Spacecraft Bus (HSB):  This is the first amendment; 1. add to paragraph 1 REQUIREMENTS of Attachment 1 Solicitation: Proposed deviations from the bus specifications that do not substantially decrease mission capability but achieve significant cost or schedule reductions are encouraged.  Such deviations should be clearly identified by the offeror’s in their proposal and may be subject to negotiation prior to contract award.  Offerors should note that whereas the spacecraft bus specification relies on the ESPA guidelines to define specifications such as envelope, there is no government preference for proposals based on the ESPA or any other specific EELV adapter ring.  The use of a DSX spacecraft structure easily integrated with an EELV as a secondary payload is required for a proposal to be considered responsive.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted and to extend the due date for proposals.

1.  The due date for proposals is hereby changed as follows:

FROM: April 16, 2004 at 3:00 PM Local Time
TO:	 April 30, 2004 at 3:00 PM Local Time

2. Responses are provided to the following technical questions:

QUESTION: What environmental conditions will be guaranteed by NIST during the acceptance testing at SURF?  Please include:
a. SURF electron beam stability - positional and angular; how and with what precision will this be verified during testing?
b. Average temperature and temperature stability in the room housing SURF III, the pre optic(s), and entrance slit.
c. Average temperature and temperature stability in the room housing the EUVL monochromator, diverting mirror, and exit slit.
d. Vibrational spectrum up to 100Hz for the room housing SURF III, the preoptic(s), and entrance slit; how and with what precision will this be verified during testing?
e. Vibrational spectrum up to 100Hz for the room housing the EUVL
monochromator, diverting mirror, and exit slit; how and with what precision will this be verified during testing?
RESPONSE: This is not relevant. The specifications do not require any performance standards for the entire instrument, but just the chamber and interior parts to be constructed by the vendor. The specifications concern only the dimensional and angular stability of the interior parts (mirror and grating) under the varying vacuum forces impressed on the chamber and the resolution and reproducibility of the angular orientation of the gratings relative to the base on which they are mounted.

QUESTION: In the solicitation you state that the "assembled unit will be tested ...initially for one week." Do you intend to perform stability tests on each grating for one full week (7 days), or will one week suffice for both gratings? Please clarify. 
RESPONSE: One week for both gratings.

QUESTION: Is point 'C 1.3.5. Data Acquisition Software' intended to be part of this request? 
RESPONSE: No.

QUESTION: Please furnish the missing thickness dimension of the diffraction gratings and toroidal pre-mirror. The sizes of these optics constrain the grating and mirror mount designs. 
RESPONSE: These can and will be provided, via a subsequent solicitation amendment next week.

QUESTION: For ray trace and design analysis, please furnish copies of the complete metrology data and metrology reports for the optical elements to be used in this beam line after the upgrade. 
RESPONSE:  These can and will be provided, via a subsequent solicitation amendment next week.

QUESTION: Please provide 'as built' specifications for the existing entrance slit, exit slit, mirror mounts, and support structures that will be supplied by NIST and incorporated in this beamline after the upgrade. Ideally, this data will include: long-term stability, short-term stability, adjustability, shifts due to atmospheric load under vacuum, repeatability and accuracy of adjustments, degrees of freedom for alignment, location and precision of fiducials on components for alignment.
RESPONSE: This is not relevant.The specifications do not require any performance standards for the entire instrument, but just the chamber and interior parts to be constructed by the vendor. The specifications concern only the dimensional and angular
stability of the interior parts (mirror and grating) under the varying vacuum forces impressed on the chamber and the resolution and reproducibility of the angular orientation of the gratings relative to the base on which they are mounted.

QUESTION:   The exit slit was mounted on a projecting beam or member supported at only one end; Modifications were intended to reduce vibrational effects.  What is the status?
RESPONSE:  This is not relevant.  The specifications do not require any performance standards for the entire instrument, but just the chamber and interior parts to be constructed by the vendor.  The specifications concern only the dimensional and angular stability of the interior parts (mirror and grating) under the varying vacuum forces impressed on the chamber and the resolution and reproducibility of the angular orientation of the gratings relative to the base on which they are mounted.

QUESTION:  In the event that problems with NIST supplied components are discovered during acceptance tests, please confirm that the intent is for the contractor to provide all necessary labor and materials to remedy all problems at no additional cost to the Government. Refer to the bottom of page 9.
RESPONSE:  This is not relevant. The specifications do not require any performance standards for the entire instrument, but just the chamber and interior parts to be constructed by the vendor.  The specifications concern only the dimensional and angular stability of the interior parts (mirror and grating) under the varying vacuum forces impressed on the chamber and the resolution and reproducibility of the angular orientation of the gratings relative to the base on which they are mounted.

QUESTION:  In the event that environmental conditions during acceptance tests at SURF are not within the range guaranteed by NIST (refer to item 1.), will NIST pay for the additional costs incurred during completion of the testing?
RESPONSE:  This is not relevant. The specifications to not require any perfomance standards for the entire instrument, but just the chamber and interior parts to be constructed by the vendor.  The specifications concern only the dimensional and angular stability of the interior parts (mirror and grating) under the varying vacuum forces impressed on the chamber and the resolution and reproducibility of the angular orientation of the gratings relative to the base on which they are mounted.

<CONTACT>Jim Allen, Facilities Purchasing Specialist, Phone 703-526-2812, Fax 703-526-2710, Email james.g.allen@usps.gov
<DESC>The Postal Service is seeking to pre-qualify contractors for its GSA Security Program, which involves upgrading up to 28 U.S. Postal Service owned facilities located throughout the continental United States and Puerto Rico.  Contractors can choose to work in a specific geographical area of the country or nationally, but contractors capable and willing to work nationally will receive a higher rating when evaluating submissions.  A list of each proposed location is listed below.  Specific scopes of work will be developed for each facility and proposals will be requested individually only from the list of pre-qualified contractors.  Work will require accessing sensitive areas of each facility operated by US Government agencies such as the United States Courts, United States Marshal Service, and other agencies, therefore there will be a need for confidentiality.  Requests for proposals may be over a time span of up to 4 years.  Successful pre-qualified contractors will be required to submit background information of its employees and employees of all subcontractors who will need to access the facility and facility sites at the time of each proposal submission.  A sample copy of the “Basic Security Clearance Requirements” will be provided, and if it is not submitted the proposal will be rejected.  Awards of any contracts will be predicated on Security Clearance approval by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, and any other Federal Agency deemed necessary specific to the individual facility.  Work at each facility will differ based on the individual needs of the facility.  Anticipated work at each facility may include perimeter security, entry security, interior security, security planning, life safety, hazardous materials (lead and asbestos) abatement, and historical preservation.  Facilities to be modified will vary from 25,000 sq. ft. to 600,000 sq. ft.  All areas described are approximate; specific areas will be denoted within the solicitation documents.  Contracts will start in Fiscal Year 2004 and have varying completion dates.  Estimated cost range is between $500,000 and $5,000,000.  Proposed location cities are Bay City, MI; Decatur, AL; Florence, AL; Evansville, IN; Fayetteville, NC; Great Falls, MO; Jefferson City, MO; Newark, NJ; Okmulgee, OK; Pendelton, OR; Ponce Atocha, PR; Waycross, GA; Brattleboro, VT; Rutland, VT; Durham, NC; Marquette, MI; Meridian, MS; Waterbury, CT; Abilene, TX; & Wichita Falls, TX.  Minimum company performance requirements include at least five (5) years experience as a construction contractor, completion or ongoing of two (2) comparable projects within the past three (3) years one of which must include Security Upgrades in a historically significant facility.  The projects in such structures typically will involve dealing with abatement procedures for hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead based paint.  Projects constructed for the direct use or occupancy of the company(s) submitting the statement will not be considered as a comparable project.  The financial stability and management plan of each respondent will also be evaluated during the pre-qualification process to determine the firm’s capability to perform.  Only the highest qualified and financially capable firms will be pre-qualified.  Qualification packages are now available, and may be obtained by written request to U.S. Postal Service, ATTENTION: Jim Allen, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1861.  You may also fax your request to Mr. Allen at 703-526-2710 or email him at james.g.allen@usps.gov.  Qualification Statements are due May 11, 2004, by 11:00 A.M. EST.  The completed statements should be delivered via one of the many services provided by the Postal Service or hand delivered to Jim Allen, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300, Arlington, VA.  Qualification Statements will not be retained or returned and contractors will not be reimbursed for any expense(s) incurred in developing their statements

GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS 
EMERGING MARKETS – WORLDWIDE 

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $134,000.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking sources to evaluate and monitor the Local Systemic Change (LSC) initiative in accordance with requirements delineated below.

Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education (ESIE) is responsible for the LSC initiativeProgram , a component of NSF’s Teacher Enhancement program since 1994.

Additionally, the contractor will prepare a technical document (publication), appropriate for dissemination to relevant audiences, that fully describes the instruments, their potential for evaluation of education programming and practice, documentation of their reliability and validity, and the skill and training needed for their effective use.  The wealth of data amassed thus far provides an opportunity to concentrate on these latter aspects of the LSC evaluation effort with the intent of (1) documenting program impacts; (2) disseminating findings, best practices, assessment instruments, and evaluation methodologies tailored to relevant audiences; and (3) developing a set of questions for future research suggested by the LSC strategy that can deepen NSF’s teacher education and education research programming.  the need to collect data from them, has created

<SUBJECT>D -- SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMNT OF LAND MOBILE RADIO OCCUPANCY MEASUREMENTS
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with RF Metrics Corporation for further software development of RSMS-4G. RSMS is a state-of-the-art measurement system designed for gathering information regarding spectrum occupancy, equipment compliance, electromagnetic compatibility, and interference resolution. RSMS is a dynamic and flexible system that incorporates automated, semi-automated, and manual techniques for the measurement and analysis of radio emissions. While not defined by any single hardware configuration, the system includes such devices as the latest in spectrum analyzers, digital oscilloscopes, vector signal analyzers, and signal detection devices. Measurements can take place in a laboratory or in the field, or they can be mobile or stationary; therefore the system has been made flexible enough to accommodate each of these situations.  A major objective in the development of the 4th generation software has been to provide a tool that can easily accommodate new equipment, different hardware configurations, and to expand on existing measurement capabilities. The following tasks will be completed in this portion of the RSMS development:
1. Further develop, using an existing RSMS4G measurement DLL, a land-mobile radio (LMR) occupancy measurement. Build on the recently developed stepped measurement by adding features to create a new measurement DLL.
2. Develop digital signal processing routines, implemented in Matlab routines or Visual Basic, for processing acquired digital data in to spectrum occupancy statistics.
The following knowledge is necessary to complete the above listed tasks:
A. Knowledge of techniques for performing LMR occupancy measurements using off the shelf instruments.
B. Knowledge of the RSMS4G software architecture critical.
C. Strong working knowledge of RF systems, and the ability to skillfully use spectrum analyzers, and vector signal analyzers for analysis of complex signal types.
D. Strong working knowledge of digital signal processing-particularly digital filter design and implementation.
E. Knowledge of the current hardware system used by ITS for RSMS spectrum and propagation measurements is preferable.
F. Working knowledge of object oriented programming using Visual Basic 6.
G. Working knowledge of WinCVS version control manager.
H. Working knowledge of amplitude probability distributions as described in Appendix E of NTIA Report 01-384: Measurements to Determine Potential Interference to GPS Receivers from Ultra wideband Transmission Systems.

ANSWER:  IRIG time isn't a requirement (every frame is time-tagged coming out of the camera head) but an IRIG card within the data acquisition system (DAS) is preferable but not required.  If the DAS does include an IRIG card, it should be one that is compatible with Rtools.

<DESC>Amendment 0004:  The purpose of this amendment is to answer additional questions received after issuance of Amendment 0001  Q.-  In reviewing the RFP criteria it appears to me to be of more of a machine to machine risk solution that the international due diligence investigative services we provide at (our company )Perhaps we would be better suited to a Task Order Contract relative to our unique investigative services that we provide to assist the investigation and litigation divisions of the SEC.  A. -  Please review the requirements portion of SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 and respond with the COTS products or services that you determine meet those requirements.  Q - I was inquiring about this particular RFP - does it include network security or information assurance capabilities?  A - Yes.  Would the SEC consider extending the proposal due date?  The due date has been extended from April 8, 2004 to April 9, 2004 at 4:00 PM  What data sources, other than Edgar, do you access today and where do they reside?  A. - The SEC has contracts with vendors to provide the following data on a subscription basis:  CRSP, CUSIP, Compustat, I/B/E/S.  Usage of this data is subject to the terms and conditions of the contracts.  Q. - What is the decision point for ensuring a vendor is competent in their ability to deliver a viable solution?  A - Please refer to the Government’s requirements and the evaluation criteria referenced in the Combination Solicitation/ Synopsis  Q - Does the SEC believe this is a COTS solution or Application Development support?  Is the solution believed to be a combination of COTS and onsite customization?  A - This particular Combination Solicitation Synopsis is for COTS solutions, however that does not rule out that the SEC would not solicit at a later date for other COTS products with customizations.  Q - If customization is required, has an analysis been conducted by the SEC to identify the magnitude of this endeavor?  A.  Until the SEC has reviewed the COTS products available, an answer to this question cannot be determined.  Q  Does the SEC want real-time/dynamic feeds and analytics?  A - The SEC is looking for any capability that will provide quality risk assessments.  Q - If the capability to provide real-time/dynamic data and reporting is the end result, what data sources will be eliminated in the process? A - The SEC will use and continue to use data sources that provide valuable information regardless of the tools implemented. Q - Will there be a requirement to secure the data and reporting?  A - Yes. The SEC operates in a secure environment and all data and data transmissions are subject to our security requirements that are referenced in the SoW. Q - If so, is there a requirement to authenticate with other environments?  (Distributed/Mainframe?)  A - It is possible that a suitably flexible solution could be integrated with other systems at the SEC, but there is no requirement for this at this time.  Q - If the SEC is analyzing data, will there be an additional requirement to provide integrity and availability controls?  A - If the SEC provides the raw data and/or uses public databases, then data integrity and availability controls are not critical.  If the vendor proposes using propriety data as part of the COTS solution then both data integrity and other data management controls are logical.  Q - After successful implementation and customization of the solution, will there be a requirement for sustainment services?  A - If the COTS product requires sustainment services, they should be proposed. Q - What Education requirements are needed?  A - This requirement is for Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solutions.  Offeror shall propose user training.  Q - What will be the system of record for the financials and what is the standard format for the data? What is the relationship of this data source to Edgar? How does the SEC envision the relationships of the data source, Edgar, and the new application for the future?  A - These questions are not relevant to this requirement.  Q - What is the timing of access to the data?  Are there sensitivity issues?  Are there security requirements for contractors working on this solution?  A. - This requirement is for COTs solutions.  The SEC requires access to data before it is 30-days old.  Standard nondisclosure/confidentiality requirements may be applicable to this requirement.  In addition, if offsite hosting is considered, additional specific SEC and government wide security requirements may be applicable. Q - Where will the solution be hosted and has the SEC considered hosting offsite?  A - Both offsite hosting and SEC hosting may be  considered.  Q - Is the SEC interested in performance based contracting and if so, what metrics should be used?  A - This requirement is for COTS product.  The contractor should propose any metrics that would be applicable.  Q - If this is not a COTS solution, how does the SEC envision evaluating prior to purchasing?  A - This requirement is for COTS solutions.  Please refer to the solicitation for evaluation criteria.  Q - The Statement of Work contemplates a base year of support and 4 optional years of work.  Can the government provide their expectation of what specific support (in the form of tasks completed, milestones met, deliverables submitted) is expected in the base year and what support might be included in the optional years?  A - The Government anticipates that COTS products will meet this requirement.  The support maintenance needed will depend on the products selected. Q Additionally, since there are not specific items identified for the optional years, would the government consider accepting a proposal for the optional years work to be done on a Time and Materials basis?  A-The SEC requirement is for COTS solutions on a firm-fixed price basis. Q - As the specifics for the optional years have not been stated, will the SEC consider this as a justification for extending the time period for response on this solicitation until greater clarity of desired scope has been provided?  A - The option years are to continue to purchase licenses and maintenance support of the COTS solution.  Q - What are the platforms and data formats for the source information (e.g. Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 20-F)?A - It is up to the vendor to determine data sources that are suitable for its COTs product.  Q - Has the SEC adopted an industry specific XML standard?  A - No.  Q - Please provide additional information on the SEC's Enterprise Architecture (e.g. Data Reference Model, Technical Reference Model). A - The SEC has not published a Data Reference Model or a Technical Reference Model.  Q - Are there any specific interoperability requirements associated with a) accessing the source information, b) sharing information with other SEC applications, c) presenting information to users, or d) automated workflow interaction with other users and systems?  A - At this time there are no particular requirements for interoperability.

A companion interest in this objective will be to use risk assessment services or products to identify anomalies in disclosure or financial reporting by public companies subject to the SEC’s disclosure program.  For this purpose, the SEC is seeking computer-based products, services, or software.  Offerors are requested to provide a detailed Capabilities Statement for a commercial product capable of achieving some or all of these objectives. C.2 Scope Commercial products shall be used to identify companies requiring additional inquiry and investigation.  These products shall assist the SEC in identifying changes in financial position or operational results in financial statement presentations not evident in a routine reading of disclosure that may represent material deficiencies in the documents filed by public companies.  C.2.1  The initial focus of this analysis will initially be Forms 10-K (annual reports), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and possibly Form 20-F (foreign private issuers).  C.2.2  Offerors’ commercial products shall provide features such as historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies.  The commercial products shall have analytical capabilities that signal risk factors.  These tools may provide pre-selected criteria for risk analysis and/or allow for customized measures.  C.3  Objectives  Offerors shall provide commercial products having a flexible user interface and/or reporting capability.  An important performance objective is a high ratio of positive signals (problem companies or reports) to false signals (indications of problems that turn out to be incorrect).  More details in databases and computational platforms are provided in the next section.  C.3.1  Desired characteristics of commercial risk assessment products include the following kinds of evaluations and/or comparisons:  1)Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data  2)Evaluation of a company’s financial ratios against parameters that may suggest inappropriate financial reporting exists  3)Evaluation of other performance measures that may suggest misleading, opaque or incomplete financial reporting  4)Comparison of a company with peers in an industry group  5)Comparison of a company’s risk evaluation with audit opinions  6)Comparison of a company’s accounting reports with other publicly available SEC information (e.g. litigation releases, accounting and auditing releases, EDGAR filings)  C.3.2  Offerors should address the extent to which financial statements conform to accounting standards, generally accepted industry practices, and the requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations.  C.4  Background and Current Environment  It is anticipated that specific risk assessment requirements and resulting objectives will evolve over time.  Consequently, the commercial products will also evolve in sophistication and complexity over time, especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission.  C.4.1 The commercial products shall initially provide for interoperability with respect to the SEC’s enterprise architecture.  The SEC’s current development environment includes 1) reporting tools such as Business Objects, Actuate, Crystal, and Brio; 2) databases such as Sybase ASE and Sybase IQ; 3) the Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio); 4) development languages such as C, TCL, Java, J2EE, HTML, UML, XML, XSLT, JSP, Struts, and Servlets (used with TomCat as the JSP server for web development); 5) PureEdge to display internet forms; 6) web services technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI; 7) Project Version Control System (PVCS) Tracker and PVCS Version Manager for configuration management of automated information systems; 8) Test Director for independent testing; 9) the search engine Autonomy; and 10) firewall and intrusion detection software.  The SEC’s current Technical Infrastructure standards include  A.  Application Servers such as Enterprise Systems:  Sun (Enterprise Servers 4000 series, 4500 series, V880 series, 280 series, E450 series)  Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Departmental Systems:  Sun (Ultra Sparc series, V120 series, 280 series) Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u   Workgroup Systems:  Compaq (File Servers - Proliant ML530, Other Compaq Special purpose servers).  (Migration):  Dell PowerEdge 2550/6450 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  Operating Environment: Microsoft NT Server 4.0  (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (Active Directory)  B.  Web Servers such as  Dell (Various Models), Sun (Enterprise Servers), Dell PowerEdge  Operating Environment:  Windows 2000, Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Software:  Netscape Suitespot 3.x, Apache, Microsoft IIS, Tomcat  C.  File Servers such as  Systems:  Dell 1650/2550/2650/6450/6650 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  (Migration):  Compliant Proliant ML360/560/580  Operating Environment: Microsoft NTS 4.0 Server/2000 (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2003  C.4.2  Vendors shall be required to ensure confidentiality with respect to SEC queries of risk assessment services and the nature of the information derived from such queries and services.  Vendors shall ensure that no details of SEC usage are disclosed to the public, including possibly a prohibition against their disclosing that the SEC is a user of their product, service, or software.  Period of performance shall be for the period of 12 months.  Award is anticipated in May 2004.  The Government intends to issue one or more commercial item purchase orders for the above items to the responsible vendor whose Capabilities Statement /quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., reliability and effectiveness of the product being proposed and its compatibility and interoperability with the SEC’s enterprise architecture),  (2) user training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4)price.    If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  This evaluation will be based on information provided by the contractor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive.  However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency).  Only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be invited to present a demonstration of their product to the SEC and will be asked to provide 30 day access to their commercial item product, free of charge, for evaluation purposes.  FAR provision 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19,52.222.21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37,52.232-33,52.232-36, 52.239-1, 52.222-41,52.222-43, 52.222-44. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.  Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov. All Capabilities Statements (technical quotes)and price quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Questions may be submitted on or before 2:00 PM EST April 1, 2004.  The price quote shall be submitted as a completely separate document from the Capabilities Statement (technical quote).  Two (2) copies of each Capabilities Statement (technical quote) and two (2) copies of each price quote shall be submitted to Debra E. Chapman, clearly marked RFQ no. SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 either via hand delivery or U.S. Mail to Securities and Exchange Commission, MS-020, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria VA 22312, or to chapmand@sec.gov, or faxed to (703) 914-9226 no later than 4:00 PM EST, April 9, 2004.
