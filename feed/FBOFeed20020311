<DESC>USDA-ARS-ARS-NSRIC,  AMES, IOWA. intends  to procure A Eddy Covariance System from Campbell Scientific, Inc. on a Sole Source basis.     This instrument is being purchased for use on a CRADA (Contract # 58-3K95-2-920) entitled," Evaluation of Air Pollution Control Methods Applied to Swine Effluent" with Premium Standard Farms in Princeton, MO that is scheduled to start on March 1, 2002 and conclude on February 28, 2003.  I am requesting a sole-source purchase of the Eddy Covariance System for the following reasons: First, the project is part of a U. S. EPA Clean Air Act enforcement lawsuit that specifies use of the CSI Eddy Covariance System for emission measurements  from swine lagoons.  The U.S. EPA has subsequently approved all quality control/quality assurance project plans mandating the use of the Eddy Covariance System for completion of emission measurements related to this CRADA.   This emission measurement system, and CO 2/   H20 analyzer is the only system approved by the U.S. EPA for Eddy Covariance emission measurements at animal feeding operations.  Secondly, a collaborating unit at the National Soil tilth Laboratory currently owns and uses three Eddy Covariance  Systems that were previously purchased through Campbell Scientific, Inc., and therefore, has made a prior investment in training personnel and purchasing part inventories for this particular device.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302.       This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for written quotation will be issued.   Request must be transmitted to facsimile number 515-663-7482 .  The anticipated award date will be 15 days after issuance of this notice..

This software provides the tools, both graphical and textual, for systems requirements analysts to document requirements for new systems or requirements for the modification of existing systems.  The Envision tool has and continues to support the Redesigned Disability System development process.  In addition, Envision has been selected by the Title II Redesign project as its principle modeling tool.  Moreover, the Envision software permits the SSA to design models supporting various systems analysis techniques.  The SSA is currently using models supporting data modeling (e.g., Entity Relationship Diagrams), process modeling (e.g., DataFlow Diagrams), screen-flow modeling, and system development modeling (e.g., Hierarchy and Structure Charts).   The SSA presently has this software installed and licensed on several personal computers located at SSA in the Operations Building.  The contractor shall provide Telephone Technical Support Services and Software Upgrades.  The maintenance agreement shall provide for any upgrade or new version of the software within 60 days of its commercial release.  All upgrades offered to the Government shall be the exact equivalent of the software offered commercially by the manufacturer, and will include documentation equivalent to that offered with the commercial release.  The vendor shall provide hotline telephone support available from 11:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal holidays.  Hotline support technicians shall provide the following types of support for the software: 1) technical assistance in installing, configuring and operating the software with the targeted hardware; 2) resolving problems concerning the software/hardware configuration and interface; 3) explaining the operational characteristics of the software product; 4) answering questions about the specific capabilities of the software package; 5) answering questions concerning local area network communications, including concepts; and 6) provide any other technical support that shall be useful to SSA support personnel.  The hotline support technicians shall provide a solution within one workday of the initial contact for 95% of all calls within any given month.  The vendor shall maintain a consistent level of technical support over the course of the renewal.  Future Tech Systems, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing the required annual software support and technical capabilities for the referenced software product.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data (including GSA Schedule information).  When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to FutureTech 2001.  Responses must be in writing and should be submitted to the address cited at the beginning of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for iSight Floating License and Yearly Maintenance. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Engineous Software, Inc., who is the only known responsible source and no other supplies and services can meet Agency needs.  Engineous Software is the developer and owner of the iSight Software Licenses.  The software is used to combine numereous optimization algorithms with the ability to interface with other codes and has to be compatible with existing hardware, software, and data files.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to duplicate this effort and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 27, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, 508-233-4146
<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager - Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a Cargo Parachute Release to be used for the 500 foot Low Velocity Airdrop Capability (LVADC).  The new Cargo Parachute Release will eventual ly replace the current M-1 and M-2 Cargo Parachute Releases so as to provide a more reliable, lower maintenance, lower weight, and lower cost release. This new Cargo Parachute Release, used with either a single or clustered parachute configuration, shall h ave the following performance characteristics: capable of delivering combat loads having suspended weights between 2,520 pounds through 22,000 pounds (objective) (15,500 pounds (threshold)); capable of withstanding the forces typically associated with LVAD  operations from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS); provide a successful airdrop completion rate of 92 percent without a system abort.  The release shall hold from 1 to 12 cargo parachutes. The release shall  be easy and quick for an Army rigger to attach to each of the 4 platform slings and to each parachute riser. The Cargo Parachute Release shall be designed to allow each parachute to be released separately from the other parachutes and the load. The releas e shall be capable of releasing the parachute(s) when the platform impacts the ground and release equally as well in all directions in ground wind speeds of 17 knots (threshold) (21 knots (objective)).  Please note that maximum rate of descent at ground im pact will not exceed 28.5 ft/sec.  No new pyrotechnics shall be used and any electrically operated device shall use in stock batteries and have a built in test circuit to show that the battery is good and the electrical circuit is ready to fire. Emphasis o n durable lightweight materials and low/simplified maintenance is highly desired.  Proposals that discuss existing releases, which provide valid test data demonstrating substantial compliance with 500' LVADC performance requirements, would be more favorabl y considered than entirely new design or engineering approaches. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ under Business Opportunities/Ongoing Acquisitions/DAAD15-02-R-001 6 on or about April 3, 2002. NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army.mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998. Firms w ill not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation.  Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: A RFP will be issued and offerors' proposals will be evaluated to determine the item's ability to me et the above requirements.  A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals that fall within the range will be issued purchase orders for prototype cargo parachute releases to be tested and evaluated. Initially, 2-10 cargo parachute relea ses will be purchased for preliminary evaluation to determine their capacity to meet the requirements defined in the performance purchase description.   These 2-10 cargo parachute releases shall be ready for testing 45 days after issuance of purchase order .  Offerors will be required to provide rigging, repair, and training support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order.  Upon completion of this evaluation and review of the proposals, a down-select will be conducted by the 500' LVADC Integrated Product Team (IPT) to award a contract to a single offeror to deliver 5 (minimum) to 25 (maximum) production ready cargo parachute releases.  These items will be subjected to DT /OT to determine if they satisfy all the performance requirements identified in the ORD.  Also included in this option will be the requirement for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include complete drawings and detailed specifications).  Upon completion of DT/OT testing, a Production OPTION - Firm Fixed Price may be issued to meet the Army's initial estimated fielding requirements approximately 2 33 cargo parachute releases.  Follow on production contracts will be awarded based on the TDP to acquire the remainder of the Army's fielding requirements of approximately 2,329 cargo parachute releases.  This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Op en Competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>B--Deepwater Program: Understanding the Processes that Maintain the Oxygen Levels in the Deep Gulf of Mexico
<SOLNBR>0102RP85080
<RESPDATE>032902
<ARCHDATE>04302002
<CONTACT>Bill Thomas, Contract Specialist, 703-787-1009 fax
<DESC>With increasing oil and gas activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a greater understanding of the environment below 400 meters is necessary for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to make decisions concerning the protection of the marine environment.  Of interest for this study is the distribution of oxygen and the processes that control its distribution, since discharges from oil and gas activities consume oxygen during degradation.  Data from the early 1960s indicates that the deep Gulf is homogenous with constant temperature, salinity, and relatively constant oxygen.  Data collected during a 2000 cruise for the Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Habitats and Benthic Ecology study confirms that the deepwater Gulf of Mexico has a relatively constant oxygen concentration of 5 ml/L.  Since the effective sill depth of the source water is 1600-1800 meters and the deepest part of the Gulf is approximately 3800 meters, the flushing time of the deep Gulf is an important element for understanding the impacted environment.  As a first step, this study will address what is already known through a data search and synthesis of all oxygen measurements in the entire Gulf of Mexico basin.  With this information, the Contractor will develop a box model that identifies the inputs and outputs of oxygen to the deep Gulf. The model will be used to evaluate inputs from oil and gas activities to determine the effects of cumulative impacts on oxygen levels.  From the model information, data gaps should be identified and a program to fill those data gaps proposed. The objective of this study is to understand the types and rates of processes occurring in the deep Gulf of Mexico that affect the levels of oxygen in deepwater and the balance that maintains this level.  The objective will be addressed by: (1) conducting a data search, synthesis, and reanalysis of all oxygen data collected from water depths greater than 400 meters throughout the entire Gulf of Mexico basin; (2) developing of a simple box model describing the sources and sinks of oxygen in the deep Gulf; (3) identifying data gaps including an evaluation of the quality of the data and its representativeness of the Gulf's basin environment; (4) proposing methods for filling the data gaps which could include field work.  The performance period of this study shall be twenty-four (24) months. The location of the study area will be the deepwater (greater than 400 meters) of the entire Gulf of Mexico basin. Cost of this study is estimated to be between $170,000 to $230,000.  This study consists of three (3) main tasks: (1) Oxygen data that has been collected within the Gulf of Mexico basin will be synthesized for this report.  Along with the data, the methodology for collecting the data will be identified. All data shall be checked for quality (assess sample collection and analysis methodology) and flagged, if determined to be in question.  The proposed study is defined as including the deep basin greater than 400 meters, however, if deemed necessary for a full evaluation of processes, additional data should be collected.  Data from the Yucatan Channel and Florida Straits should be included.  Trends in the data, such as differences between eastern and western basins, should be discussed in the analysis.  A statistical analysis of the data should be included. Any studies that have determined the flushing rates of the Gulf of Mexico should also be included in the review; (2) A simple box model should be constructed that represents all inputs to and outputs from the deep Gulf of Mexico basin.  The box model should adequately address the complexity of the distribution of oxygen and include the oxygen minimum zone and the eastern and western basins of the Gulf of Mexico.  The model should be used to estimate the flushing time of the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the potential impacts on dissolved oxygen in the water column and in surficial sediments from oil and gas activities should beincluded in the model or in additional calculations; (3) From the box model and data synthesis, information gaps should be identified. Options for filling those data gaps should be included. To Respond: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform work by providing Capabilities Statements by 3/29/02  Detailing: (1) Your key personnel, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility  for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications and specific expertise and experience.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of physical and chemical oceanography; (2) Your organization's experience with this type of work and a description of your facilities; and (3) Specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name, and current telephone number) for work of this nature that your personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed within the last three years.  Also, please include any negative references and your rebuttal explaining your side of the story. All references will be checked to validate the information provided. Offerors shall submit an original and two (2) copies of the Capabilities Statement to Bill Thomas, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170-4817. Six (6) additional copies shall be submitted to Ms. Connie Landry, Minerals Management Service, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, MS 5431, New Orleans, Louisiana 70123-2394. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to ensure that the Capabilities Statements are received by the dates and time set forth above. Timeliness of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Your capabilities statement will be evaluated based on: (1) Past performance which includes: adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of previous products delivered, effectiveness of program management, and the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties.  (2) The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, and size; (3) The experience and expertise of all scientific and technical Key Personnel.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute proposes to enter into a six month purchase order with Biospace, 245 11th Street, San Francisco, CA 94115	to provide for services associated with the management of catalogue content associated with the NCI e-commerce program, IntraMall.  Approximately five years ago, NCI entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Biospace to develop, implement, maintain and improve an e-commerce ordering system for laboratory/office equipment and supplies.  This agreement included the development of the core software and related integration into the NIH accounting system, maintaining the system, and assisting users. Vendors who signed up for the Mall,  listed their products in an electronic catalog.  The services provided by Biospace, per the CRADA was at no cost to the Government and while the CRADA did not specifically include assistance in managing the content of vendor catalogues, Biospace also provided this service for a period of time at no cost.  

It is now apparent Biospace will not be able to provide the services associated with managing the contents of the vendor catalogues in the near future.  NCI has a need for a contractor to provide support services to the vendor community associated with the management of the catalogue content to be used in the NIH IntraMall.  These support services will include managing vendor communications, providing help desk services for vendor issues, assisting in catalogue loading, categorization and maintenance, facilitating order management, providing vendor training in basic catalogue and order processing skills, and performing account management for billing issues with the vendor community. At the end of this six month period, Biospace will provide shall provide metrics associated with vendor acquisition and catalogue content, an electronic copy of monthly NIH IntraMall transaction data, and an electronic copy of  all historic IntraMall transaction data.

It is believed that Biospace is the only source who can fulfill the Government's needs.  Working under the auspicies of the CRADA, they have developed much of the metrics, programming and systems for the electronic ordering system.  This data is proprietary to Biospace as they developed the system at no cost to the Government.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI end user to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on March 25, 2002. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) has a requirement to investigate and/or develop new multi-resolution techniques based on spherical spline representation and their adaptation to the problems of geopotential modeling.  In the course of investigation, develop all necessary tools both mathematical and theoretical, solve the estimation problem using spherical splines employing a combination of gravity, satellite and altimetry measurements.  Develop an approach for error propagation within the multi-resolution model.  Compare the results and approach with those via spherical harmonic models.  Unclassified test data sets available to NIMA of gravity and altimetry measurements may be furnished to the contractor upon request.  Contractor will be responsible for all equipment, information and materials necessary to accomplish the following specific tasks of this requirement: (1) Determine the feasibility of using multi-resolution methods such as spherical splines to represent the geopotential locally and globally.  This will be extended to vector functions defined on the sphere, as well as to functions defined in the space above the sphere and (approximately) satisfying Laplace's equation; (2) using global and local gravity data sets, construct appropriate multi-resolution spline representation of the potential for global and local fields. Test the new representation with conventional models and geopotential prediction techniques.  Contractor shall prepare a technical report detailing all findings, conclusions and recommendations on the best methodology to pursue.  The technical report shall be submitted in softcopy on either a DOS formatted CD or 3.5 inch magnetic media disk.  Report shall be written in either Microsoft Word 98 or later, Rich Text Format (.rtf) or in Portable Document Format (.pdf).  NIMA intends to award this requirement to Ohio State University, subject to the availability of funds.

Any presentation of any statistical or analytical materials, or any reports based on information obtained from studies covered by this, will be subject to review and approval by the Director before publication or dissemination.  .PHYSICAL DEMANDS: Sedentary work.  8.  WORK ENVIRONMENT:  Work is normally performed in the Refractive Surgery Center, Branch Medical Clinic, NTC, San Diego.  Contractor may be required to visit various computer facilities, offices, clinical and research areas within NMCSD. 9.  DRUG USE:  The Secretary of the Navy has determined that the illegal possession or use of drugs and paraphernalia in a military setting contributes directly to military drug abuse and undermines command efforts to eliminate drug abuse among military personnel.  The policy of the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is to deter and detect drug offenses on military installations.  Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulations issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.  10.  FAILURE TO PERFORM:  Should the contractor be unable to perform duties under this contract due to medical or physical disability for more than 13 consecutive days or because of questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct, performance under this contract may be suspended by the contracting officer until such medical or physical disability is resolved, or until such questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct have been resolved.  If performance under the contract is so suspended, no compensation or reimbursement shall accrue to the contractor so long as performance is suspended.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) desires to pre-qualify suppliers for the management and conduct of a National Mystery Shopping Program with up to 65,600 shops per year geographically throughout all of the United States. There are approximately 8,100 retail outlets that are each shopped about 8 times a year.  The program requirements are set forth in more detail in the Pre-qualification Package.  In order to be considered, interested parties must request, complete, and submit electronically a pre-qualification package that describes your firm's abilities to meet the USPS requirements, this demonstration includes resources, both personnel and financial.  Your capability statement will be evaluated on your experience in conducting mystery shopper programs, experience in providing web-based query and reporting tool that is Section 508 compliant.  The information on what is required for pre-qualification is contained therein.  Following review of the capability statements, a list of those deemed most qualified to perform the work will be generated.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others thereby precluding contract opportunities for the less-qualified.  The USPS decision to pre-qualify suppliers is a business decision of the Contracting Officer.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Those firms determined to be pre-qualified will be the only ones to receive subsequent solicitation for support of the USPS Mystery Shopper Program.  Requests for the pre-qualification must be made by e-mail to:  lzelnick@email.usps.gov.  Submission date for the pre-qualification package is March 27, 2002.

Any additional parking spaces in accordance with local codes, if required, and adequate handicap parking at no additional cost to the government.  The cost of moving, alterations, telecommunications relocation, etc., will be considerations in determining the best opportunity for the government. 

Unique Requirements: Prospective buildings must present a dignified and professional appearance.  The office and related space shall be on the ground floor and must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls.  The space shall be no more than twice as long as it is wide.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) has a requirement to investigate, develop and solve the problems associated with the implementation of complex exponentials on an arbitrary surface in a multi-resolution setup to solve for a new Global Gravitational Model.  In the course of investigation, develop all necessary tools both mathematical and theoretical, solve the estimation problem using complex exponentials employing a combination of gravity, satellite, and altimetry measurements.  Develop an approach for error propagation within the multi-resolution model.  Compare the results and approach with those via spherical harmonic models.  Unclassified test data sets available to NIMA of gravity and altimetry  measurements may be furnished to the contractor upon request.  Contractor will be responsible for all equipment, information and materials necessary to accomplish the specific tasks of this requirement.  The work will be accomplished in three distinct phases, each having a length of no more than three months, for a total time of nine months to complete all three phases: Phase I - Implementation of complex exponentials on an arbitrary surface in a multi-resolution setup.  Contractor will perform experiments on band-limited data interpolation.  Contractor shall, during this period, arrive at a complete mathematical formulation for all problems, set a path to their solution and identify the necessary software for all remaining tasks in this project.  Phase II - The contractor shall implement the solver for the estimation problem, first for complex exponentials by itself and then in combination with other data sources.  Phase III - Contractor shall compare their results to those obtained with spherical harmonic models and investigate the issue of error propagation.  Contractor shall prepare a technical report detailing all findings, conclusions and recommendations on the best methodology to pursue.  The technical report shall be submitted in softcopy on either a DOS formatted CD or 3.5 inch magnetic media disk.  Report shall be written in either Microsoft Word 98 or later, Rich Text Format (.rtf) or in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC), Genome Structure and Function Section (GSFS) is a central NCI resource for investigating the organization and function of centromeric and telomeric regions of human chromosomes, for characterizing human disease genes and for developing new methods to facilitate these goals.  One of the main projects in LBC relates to Human Genome Initiative and includes isolation and characterization of segments missing from the draft human genome sequence.  The GSFS plans to enter into a sole source contract with Mr. Jung-Hyun Kim, 840 Hadan-Dong Saha-Ku, Pusan, Korea 604-714.  This procurement will provide expert isolation of segments missing from the draft human genome sequence by Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast.  The Genome Structure and Function Section is in collaboration with Dr. Sun-Hee Leem at the Department of Biology and the College of Natural Sciences, Pusan, South Korea.  Mr. Jung-Hyun Kim is a research assistant in the laboratory of Dr. Leem in South Korea and in the USA.  The main scientific interest and expertise of this laboratory is new technologies for direct isolation of large chromosomal fragments from mammalian genomes for structural and functional studies. During the last year, Mr. Kim has worked on a number of collaborative projects for four months in NCI, LBC and eight months at the Department of Biology of the College of Natural Sciences in South Korea.  He has also participated in a project on optimization of selective capture of human genes by a TAR cloning technique.  Results of this work are summarized in two papers one of which has been recently published in Oncogene.  Mr. Jung-Hyun Kim has expertise in investigating optimal conditions for selective isolation of human genes by TAR cloning techniques.  TAR cloning techniques are non standard, hard to master and require long periods of training.  Mr. Kim is well versed in the techniques that the NCI LBC are utilizing to complete human genome sequencing.  The results of this work will form a foundation to generate the first contiguous DNA sequence of entire human chromosomes.  The results also form a foundation to discovery of new human genes and to study of organization of human centromere.  Mr. Jung-Hyun Kim is the only source known to the NCI researcher who is intimately involved with the techniques that are required to complete human genome sequencing relating to the laboratory.    This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EST, on March 25, 2002.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, (301)-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Faxed copies of capability statements will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) plans to procure a Two-Photon Laser System upgrade to an existing Government owned Zeiss LSM 410 from LSM Technologies, Inc., 24 Northbrook Lane, Suite A, Shrewsbury, PA 17361.   The LMB is currently working on project using calcium imaging techniques to study calcium transients in CNS stem sells during proliferation and differentiation.  Stem cell differentiation and synapese formation takes 10 days in which the stem cells are continually monitored and must stay on the microscope.  The upgraded system will provide a 3 position detection system that allows the microscope to be used in the following modes without removing the detection system:  1) single photon;  2) conventional microscopy and 3)  non-descanned multi-photon. The system provides a short light path between the specimen and detector which is crucial for the imaging of low-level fluorescent light from the specimen.  This system provides direct cooling for the detectors which is necessary when the microscope is placed in an environmental chamber and heated to 37 degrees C.  The investigator requires a Laser System where the lasers are stable over long periods of time.  It is critical that the wavelength, mode-locking and illumination remain do not fluctuate for extended period of time.  The laser system must have a thermally compensated resonator that automatically offsets the effects of thermal fluctuations.  The laser includes a separate CW cavity arm to facilitate alignment which is tunable.  This upgrade is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  LSM Technologies, Inc is the only organization known to the NINDS researcher that has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on March 18, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate, 2251 Maxwell Ave, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 
A ? REQUIREMENT
This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) requests proposals for Advanced Beam Control/Compensation Technologies.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBA), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals for the Analysis, Engineering, Research or Simulation for Optical and Laser Systems (AERoSOLS) program. Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) and Airborne Laser (ABL) transmitting systems, including the extended-range ABL (ER ABL) scenarios, require advanced beam control/compensation techniques to correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence.   The purpose of this acquisition is to contract for research, analysis, simulation and instrumentation development work relevant to beam control and atmospheric characterization.  The main technical objective is to perform modeling, simulation and analysis of advanced concepts and to baseline them for testing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Labs (MIT/LL) Advanced Concepts Laboratory (ACL).  Concepts with promising ACL results will be field tested at North Oscura Peak (NOP). If they show promise there, they will be candidates for insertion into the systems mentioned above.   A secondary objective is to develop or support innovative techniques for measuring and predicting atmospheric turbulence for the laser or imaging systems of interest. A third objective is to improve or advance instrumentation state-of-the-art for systems or experiments to advance the first two technical objectives.

1.  Concept Generation and Validation:  This objective seeks innovative concepts to improve tracking and atmospheric compensation for ABL, ATL, or ER ABL missions. It may include the analysis, simulation, experimental planning, experiment participation and data analysis, to verify the efficacy of said concepts. 

2.  Simulation and Analysis:  This objective provides for analysis and simulation in support of DEBA's various efforts in ABL, ATL, ER ABL and atmospheric turbulence measurement and prediction. It also includes tasks to provide data analysis of experimental data taken in support of these efforts. 

3.  Instrumentation Improvements and Support:  Design, build and implement Instrumentation primarily, but not exclusively, in support of experiments at NOP, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), and ACL at MIT/LL as well as various atmospheric measurement efforts  

4.  Atmospheric Characterization Efforts:  This objective provides for atmospheric characterization efforts that involve development of instrumentation and systems, data collection, analysis of data, and simulation of results.  The instrumentation development involves developing or improving sensors, data collection systems, and platforms. Data collection includes using these new systems as well as other existing systems as specified by the government.  Analysis of data includes observations from such systems as well as from other sources as satellite-obtained observations, radiosonde observations, and weather maps.  Simulations include efforts related to the measurement programs for incorporating estimated effects.

E-PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: 1. Proposals will be evaluated by a peer or scientific review process which outlined in AFMC FARS 5335.016-90 or 5335.90, as appropriate, using the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance.   (1)  The overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal, including capabilities and related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives; and (2) importance to AFRL/DEBA programs; and (3) availability of funds.  No further evaluation factors will be used in selecting proposals.  AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  2.  Affordability will be evaluated using the factors of reasonableness and realism. 3. This evaluation will lead to a categorization of proposals as Category 1, Category II, or Category III.  4. Proposal categories are as follows:  (i) Category I:  Well conceived, scientifically and technically sound proposals pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results.  Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals; (ii) Category II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals requiring further development and are recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I; (iii) Category III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs.  5. Following proposal categorization, AFRL will enter into negotiations with selected Category I offerors. Cost realism will be assessed for those offers selected for negotiation and price reasonableness will be determined prior to making any award. If AFRL enters into negotiations with an offeror, but is unable to reach agreement, that proposal may be displaced by a lower rated proposal. AFRL may at that time enter into negotiations with an offeror not originally contacted for negotiations.

F ? OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR AWARD: 1. In order to receive a DOD contract, offerors must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program utilizing a DD 1540 form. For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil. 2.  Interested concerns shall have or be capable of obtaining a SECRET facilities clearance.  It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL/ for further information on certification and the approval process.

<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide for the storage and distribution of their repository of chemical and drug samples.  This contract is responsible for the web-based acquisition of new compounds for testing and the receipt, storage, distribution, documentation, and inventory of synthetic compounds, bulk chemical drugs and crystalline natural products which have been identified as potential anticancer and anti-AIDS agents.  This effort also includes the plating of approximately 140,000 compounds in the DTP open repository.  The contractor shall take responsibility for all tasks of the repository.  The responsibilities shall include the receipt, weighing, distribution and storage of new and previously acquired chemical samples.  All new potential chemotherapeutic agents evaluated by the Program, whether single compounds or plated materials, are received and registered in the Program by this contract.  The contractor is also responsible for the management of correspondence to and from the compounds suppliers; for creation, using the web-based acquisition procedures, and maintenance of the chemical database; systematic file and record keeping; and reacquisition of needed samples for continued in vitro testing and subsequent in vivo studies.  The contractor shall provide for the proper disposal of samples which have been returned from various screening laboratories, and  shall prepare Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific compounds as required by the Project Officer.  In addition, the Contractor controls the inventory of approximately 400,000 chemical samples, which are a valuable resource to the Program and the extramural community.  PHARMACEUTICAL, CHEMICAL, OR BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS COMPETITION SINCE THE COMPOUND SAMPLES AND COMPOUND INFORMATION STORED IN THE DTP COMPUTER SYSTEM IS OF A PROPRIETARY NATURE.  A pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.  It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, term (level of effort) type contract award will be made for a five-year period of performance with incremental funding each year.  To assist in the preparation of a proposal, the Government considers the effort to be 28,500 direct labor hours annually.  The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately 03/27/2002.  The proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  The RFP # N02-CM-17001-28 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  DSCP-Philadelphia anticipates possible receipt of a future requirement to solicit for pharaceutical supplies for the US Naval Fleet.  The contract would be awarded to a business concern(s) that function as the Naval Fleet's primary source for a specified class of pharm products.

PURPOSE:  To obtain comments for industry regarding industry's understanding of Navy Fleet unique pharmaceutical ordering, shipping receiving invoicing and shelf life requirements.  The Navy intends to use industry's comment to assist in validating the Navy's processes and define the Navy's requirements in a draft statement of work.  It is anticipated that the draft Statement of Work would be released for review and comment through pre-solicitation conference or notice.  NO AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.  NO PAYMENT WILL BE MADE FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY.  Please submit answers to the following questions:

1.  Is your order entry system capable of receiving single line item orders by delivery order number and providing acknowledgement of each line item order within a specified time frame complete with order status?

2.  Is your EOE capable ot providing invoicing based on single line item ordering?

3.  If your current order, receipt, tracking and invoicing system(s) are not configured to receive/invoice for single line item orders, what would be the estimated cost associated with making a system change to accommodate this need?

4.  Does you current ystem allow for automated tracking of dated/shelf life pharm products bearing an expiration date/shelf life of at least 12 months?

5.  If not, what tracking method would you use and what would be the estimated cost associated with obtaining a system to track product expiration dates/shelf life of at least 12 months?

6.  If your current system does not allow for automated tracking of dated/shelf life pharm products bearing an expiration date/shelf life of at least 12 months, what minimum date does it track?

<DESC>We have been given notice that funding may not be released for this project.  Therefore, this project is put on hold indefinitely.  Once we know for sure funding is available, we will revise this notice with a new due date.

Professional land surveying services for the monumentation and posting of Colville National Forest Boundaries. 

The project name is the Leona Fire Cadastral Survey and is located on the Republic Ranger District, Colville National Forest, Ferry County, Washington.  The project location is T. 38 & 39 N., R. 34 E., W.M., which is approximately north east of Republic, Washington.

The project consists of up to 1 records research, 12 each corner searches, 6 miles of control survey, 15 each corner monumentation, 6 miles of marking and posting, 1 job of records and reports and 38 each maintenance of existing corners.  Estimated contract time is 120 calendar days with an estimated start work date of June 24, 2002.  

Interested and qualified firms are invited to respond by submitting one copy of forms SF-254, SF-255 and supplementary narrative and samples as follows: (a) Provide a brief description of steps you will use to complete a project of this type, (b) Describe your corner search process; (c) What measurement and observation techniques will be used to assure compliance with contract specifications?  (d) Some examples of land survey problems you have encountered on similar projects and how you resolved them;  (e) How will corner monumentation be accomplished?  (f) How will marking and posting be accomplished?  (g) How will control survey be accomplished?  (h) How will you accomplish the research needed?  (i) Name, registration number and percent of time, Professional Land Surveyor in charge of project will spend on each phase, and  (j) Submit a copy of a recent survey plat that is representative of your cadastral work.  

Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;  (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials;  (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;  (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;  (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified, given the nature and size of the project; and  (6) Additional points may be assigned or credit given to potential contractors that are or will subcontract with a Small Business Administration certified 8(a) contractor or other small disadvantaged businesses. This project is somewhat unique in that numerous corner searches are being asked for without the benefit of dependent resurvey.

<DESC>This modification is to synopsize the requirement for options during the period of performance. It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure services on a sole source basis from Cygnus Corporation, Rockville, Maryland.  NLM requires the continued services of Cygnus Corporation to acquire and add chemical structure and other data to the NLM ChemIDplus Database.  Cygnus lead personnel have over 6 years experience with MDL ISIS and ChemScape software, over two years supporting the NLM ChemIDplus database, and over 6 years with the chemical information and literature scanning part of the anti-HIV program at NIAID.  Cygnus personnel have had previous experience in this product and the software used to support it. Cygnus personnel also have experience in the NIAID chemical biological systems, including HIV/AIDS data of interest to NLM. Cygnus has previously doubled the number of chemical structures in ChemIDplus, as well as provided quality control on the data previously added. SIS needs upgrades to handle the more complex user chemical structure query capabilities that are planned by SIS. Cygnus has a combination of Chemical Structure and Biomedical Information and Chemscape, ISISHost, ISISDirect, Oracle, and Unix/NT expertise that is not available in the other SIS contractors, and continuation will allow this work to be done collaboratively in an expeditious manner to enhance the public ChemIDplus System. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM synopsis No. NLM 02-071/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics: The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI). The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States. Requirement is for office space on-site at the University of Memphis, as well as a graduate research assistant, GIS services, computer network access with CERI, and other miscellaneous services, including a dedicated fax line. The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(e)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information, Memphis, Tennessee, 38152, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<SUBJECT>B -- GROUNDMASTER ACOUSTIC SYSTEM
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center intends to award a non-competitive purchase order via request for written quotation to International Industries, Inc., 407 Innovation Drive, Annapolis, MD to be delivered by 04/22/02.  The anticipated award date is 03/18/02. This equipment is needed to evaluate the distribution of native mussels in rivers and determine environmental factors that are contributing population declines.  The proposed contractor offers unique qualifications in the followings areas, which are considered essential to the requirement.  These unique and essential qualifications of the equipment are 1) the equipment meets the requirements for remote sensoring of mussel beds and sediment characteristics in rivers, 2) is a portable system capable of operating waters less than 0.5 meters deep, 3) It can be configured to use two 200 kHz transducers for working in both shallow and deep water, 4) the wide beam of one transducer is designed to work in very shallow water because it samples a footprint on the river bottom that is equal to the working depth, which is sufficiently large to identify low density mussel beds, 5) the narrow beam transducer samples a much smaller footprint and work in areas with depths up to 20 meters, and 6)  the system outputs the classification data in real time, and provides direct information on the sediment characteristics.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.
