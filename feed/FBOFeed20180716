<DESC>NSN: Not Applicable. P/N: Not Applicable.<br /><br />This effort is for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider Precision Strike Package (PSP) enabled gunships. Sole source award will be made to the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), CAGE: 8X691, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The PSP is comprised of numerous systems in unique configurations for which there are no existing DoD organic maintenance support and no published technical orders. Therefore, CLS is required to maintain these systems until verified maintenance technical orders can be published and organic personnel trained. SNC will be responsible for performing CLS and providing support labor at host aircraft locations. This responsibility requires troubleshooting and Organizational Level (O- Level) maintenance/repair of the PSP and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) (Mission Operator Pallet (MOP), Trainable Gun Mount (TGM), and Dragon's Breath cargo door) on the host aircraft and shipping/receiving repairable assets in order to minimize costs and maximize system availability.<br /><br />The services sought to meet the system support requirement include: Field Service Representative (FSR) labor, engineering support, program management, travel, spares and repairs, other direct costs, emergency support services, and data, as required. The FSR support includes providing technical reviews and advice on any and all technical system/equipment/training issues. FSRs also provide recommended corrections to deficiencies in systems, equipment and training, and input to the material management processes including provisioning and spares distribution. The CLS will be provided at two (2) in-garrison locations and various deployed locations simultaneously.<br />DELIVERY SCHEDULE: One (1) basic ordering period from 1 April 2019 to 30 March 2020, five (5) one (1) year ordering periods, and one (1) six (6) month ordering period.<br /><br />Any questions should be directed to the buyer/Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) identified below. If your concerns are not satisfied by the PCO, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact the Ombudsman, Michelle Ponsell, at 478-222-4097, or via email at: michelle.ponsell@us.af.mil.<br /><br />Anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) RELEASE DATE: On or About 31 July 2018. <br />Anticipated RESPONSE DATE: To Be Determined<br />Anticipated/Estimated Award Date: 1 April 2019<br />

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.   Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer William J. Stephenson, 405-739-9077, william.stephenson.4@us.af.mil.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Document Destruction Collection and Disposal

Document Destruction Container Collection/Removal - Labor and materials necessary for the collection and removal of documents.  Material is shred on-site and the final shredding must comply with Directive 6371. There are approximately 170-180 (number varies depending on internal office moves) shredding consoles needing weekly service. Additionally, there are usually several 95-gallon totes requiring emptying in excess/overflow area located in basement of Building 11.

The contractor will perform all required services identified in this statement of work (SOW).  Contractor will furnish containers at various locations as per below. 

Vendor shall strictly adhere to Federal, State and Local regulations pertaining to the collection, handling, packaging and disposal of sensitive and secured material including Directive 6371. The process through which temporary paper records are pulped, macerated, shredded or otherwise destroyed to a degree that definitively ensures that they are not readable or reconstructable to any degree. 

Interim Destruction: VAMC Northport strongly prefers shredding to be done on-site.  However, if through unforeseen circumstances, the contractor cannot perform this task on a temporary basis, an information destruction contractor (or its subcontractor of third party) can perform final destruction away from a VA facility if the following stipulations are applied: 


(1) Its destruction process constitutes final destruction as defined in Directive 6371.
(2) It has implemented reasonable physical safeguards to protect VA temporary paper records during their transportation, transfer, or short-term storage prior to the completion of their final destruction. Long-term storage (e.g., more than 30 days) must be approved in advance and in writing by the VA organization that generated the temporary paper records.

Any physical destruction process that substantially reduces the risk that PII, PHI, or other VA sensitive information will be disclosed during transport and short-term storage (i.e., less than 30 days) of temporary paper records but does not meet the requirement of final destruction as defined in this Directive. Interim destruction is a reasonable physical safeguard that affords an additional layer of security for temporary paper records once they are identified for destruction. This may be while they are stored at a VA location awaiting final destruction or when they are removed from VA custody until final destruction is completed at an off-site location. It is generally accomplished through maceration, chopping, pulverization, or shredding where these processes do not render the material unreadable or where the material could be reconstructed. Interim destruction is not required but is strongly recommended to reduce risk; it will be a consideration as to whether a facility has completed due diligence in the event of a data breach.
(3) Upon completion of interim destruction, the vendor is to provide the final Certificate of Destruction.

Each technician must carry and use a device that records the servicing of each console/bin.  If a device is not used by the vendor; some method of identifying each console/bin serviced must be provided by the contractor.  Service can be denied if this device is not on hand.

<SUBJECT>Purchase of HP Jet Fusion 580

<RESPDATE>073118
<CONTACT>Timothy Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 7704882791, Email TLWilliams3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to The Print Machine Incorporated. The address is 1241 Assembly Street; Columbia, South Carolina 29201-3121.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541519 (Other Computer Related Services). The size standard is $27.5 Million dollars.</p>
<p>The Government intends to purchase one HP Jet Fusion 580 needed by the Emergency Response Branch (ERB). The HP Jet Fusion 580 will be used to produce custom, prototype-grade labware used by automated sample processing robots within the Emergency Response Branch.</p>
<p>The Emergency Response Branch (ERB) has been using filament deposition modeling (FDM) to produce custom labware, jigs and fixtures. Small lab fixtures were made to support advanced robotic sample processing systems for ERB and other branches with the Division of Laboratory Sciences. ERB has a continuing need to produce these custom lab fixtures with greater accuracy, precision, durability, chemical resistance and in higher throughput than our current systems can deliver. Only production grade systems can deliver these requirements. The HP Jet Fusion 580 has several key features not found together on other production grade additive manufacturing systems. Such as specifically high resolution, nylon materials, full CMYK color prints, high throughput and ultra-high level control of color and material property. The HP Jet Fusion 580 operates at a very high resolution of 1200 DPI and has a minimum layer height of 80 um which allows it to produce high accuracy, high precision parts in full CMYK color. The HP Jet Fusion 580 uses Nylon (PA-12) base materials which are ideally suited for labware, jigs and fixtures that are used with robotic laboratory liquid handlers because they are strong, durable and have excellent chemical resistant properties. In addition to nylon materials, the Jet Fusion 580 was designed to have control of color and material properties at the pixel volume "voxel" level. This ultra-high level of control will allow the Jet Fusion 580 to change material and color property at print resolution of 1200 DPI. The Jet Fusion 580 has a 15.6L build volume which is ideally suited for the part sizes used on our robotic liquid handlers.</p>
<p>Only The Print Machine specially makes the HP Jet Fusion 580 upon demand to exact CDC specifications. The Jet Fusion 580 produces parts much faster than traditional additive manufacturing techniques such as filament deposition or laser sintering because each layer of the entire part is deposited on a single pass of the print head as opposed to a very large number of x/y movements within a single part layer. The Jet Fusion 580 excels at printing multiple parts simultaneously and can stack additional parts in the z-dimension without printing any support material. The layer print speed and z-axis stacking combine to make the Jet Fusion 580 an incredibly high-throughput system.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to The Print Machine, Incorporated. The Print Machine Incorporated is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Tim Williams via email to TLWilliams3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 75D301-18-Q-68816 in the subject line, no later than 8:00am Eastern Time, July 31, 2018.</p>

As used in this clause- 

 “Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item”- 

(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is-

(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101); 

(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and

(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and

(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products. 

 “Component” means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.

 “Cost of components” means-

 (3) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or

(4) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.

 “Domestic end product” means-

 (1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;

(2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if-

(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the agency determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic; or

(ii) The end product is a COTS item.

 “End product” means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under the contract for public use.

 “Foreign end product” means an end product other than a domestic end product.

 “United States” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.

(b) 41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American, provides a preference for domestic end products for supplies acquired for use in the United States. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the component test of the Buy American statute is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)). 

(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.

(d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision of the solicitation entitled “Buy American Certificate.”<BR><BR>(a) Except as authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the Department of the Treasury, the Contractor shall not acquire, for use in the performance of this contract, any supplies or services if any proclamation, Executive order, or statute administered by OFAC, or if OFAC’s implementing regulations at 31 CFR Chapter V, would prohibit such a transaction by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

(b) Except as authorized by OFAC, most transactions involving Cuba, Iran, and Sudan are prohibited, as are most imports from Burma or North Korea, into the United States or its outlying areas. Lists of entities and individuals subject to economic sanctions are included in OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons at http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn. More information about these restrictions, as well as updates, is available in the OFAC’s regulations at 31 CFR Chapter V and/or on OFAC’s website at http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac. 

(c) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts.<BR><BR>The resulting award will be a firm fixed price delivery order.<BR><BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract.  In the event the Contractor effects any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the changes will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual authorized to accept nonconforming work, waive any requirement of the contract, or to modify any term or condition of the contract.  The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally obligate Government funds.  No cost chargeable to the proposed contract can be incurred before receipt of a fully executed contract or specific authorization from the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>Under no circumstances shall the Contractor, or anyone acting on behalf of the Contractor, refer to the supplies, services, or equipment furnished pursuant to the provisions of this contract in any news release or commercial advertising without first obtaining explicit written consent to do so from the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E214, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.
<p><br />Description:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), plans to procure on a sole source basis support services for weekly submission of medical claims data from oncologist providers and oncology practices from the same, ongoing patients services from Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC.; 5905 E. Galbraith Rd. Ste 8000; Cincinnati, OH, 45249.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 518210 and the business size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. The Period of Performance is estimated to be twelve (12) months from the effective date stated in the award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The DCCPS both generates new knowledge and seeks to ensure that the products of cancer control research are effectively applied in all segments of the population. Through innovative research initiatives, leadership, and the synthesis of knowledge and its dissemination, we are building this program to be the nation's model for cancer control science.<br /><br />The SRP provides national leadership in the science of cancer surveillance as well as analytical tools and methodological expertise in collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based cancer statistics. This surveillance infrastructure benefits the public, policymakers, and scientists in understanding changes in cancer incidence and outcomes in all segments of the US population over time. <br /><br />Healthcare providers in all 50 states are required by law to report new cases of cancer to their state's cancer registries. The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collects data on each and every cancer patient in SEER covered areas. This data includes demographics, a description of their cancer, limited initial treatment information, and patient follow-up including cause of death for deceased patients. In the past the main source of registry data came from Hospitals. With the increasing complexity of cancer care and delivery systems, patients are being increasingly treated exclusively at physicians' offices. Thus, for SEER to continue capturing all cancer cases and their treatment information SEER is interested in obtaining other sources of data such as claims data from oncology practices. Oncology practice claims has proven to be a rich source of information on detailed systemic therapy, including agents, doses administration dates etc.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2015, the NCI SEER Program began supporting the procurement of oncology practice claims data for six (6) SEER central cancer registries (see related contracts listed below), from Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC. Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC provides healthcare information systems to a national community of oncology practices. In addition to obtaining cancer treatment information for cases recently diagnosed, SEER is interested in evaluating the long history of claims to assess longitudinal treatment as well as progression and/or cancer recurrence. To do this, it is crucial to have a very long series of longitudinal claims on the same cancer patient. The SEER Program has already obtained claims for a substantial number of SEER cancer patients for the years 2013-2017 for Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico and Utah from oncology practices and oncologists, referenced here as providers. The current Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC providers have already provided consent to Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC to send claims to the respective central cancer registries to fulfil their obligation in reporting cancer cases.</p>
<p>These claims are currently being used by SEER registries to ascertain new cancer cases more rapidly as the claims are received weekly, to capture systemic therapy and to ascertain follow-up information in terms of vital status of cancer patients. The SEER Program is interested in continuing to support the transmission of claims data for current providers, as well as to support the expansion of this capability, for additional providers within the SEER regions, or new states/areas covered by cancer registration that the Program identifies as important to obtain claims data information. This project is critical in order for SEER to continue being relevant and advance cancer surveillance and research.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to maintain the weekly submission of medical claims data from oncologist providers and oncology practices that have already provided consent, and which are in compliance with cancer reporting guidelines according to their respective states (see below). These claims are crucial to obtain detailed treatment information for new cancer cases, to assess longitudinal treatment as well as progression, recurrence and to more rapidly ascertain cancer cases. To obtain longitudinal treatment information, as well as recurrence and progression, it is crucial to obtain a very long series of claims for each individual cancer patient and maintain consistency on the cancer patients being covered.</p>
<p>SEER / Area Number of Oncology Practices<br />Georgia / 85<br />Kentucky /&nbsp;2<br />Utah / 25<br />Louisiana / 3<br />New Mexico / 25</p>
<p>A second objective is to onboard new practices with the capability to transmit claims data within the existing SEER areas, as well as in additional states/areas covered by cancer registration.</p>
<p>Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />The healthcare technology Contractor shall be able to provide claims data as described below for oncology practices of interest to the SEER Program.</p>
<p>Weekly Claims Data Submissions (12-Months: 1 - 300 Providers)<br />The Contractor shall submit current claims data for providers which have previously been configured with the FARreach data relay platform. Data shall be submitted through an NCI provided secured portal on a weekly basis, and be in the ANSI Health Care Claim Transition Set (837) standard format</p>
<p>Onboard Practices (12-Months: six (6) Practices)<br />The Contractor shall onboard new practices within specified catchment areas identified by the NCI COR. This includes, but is not limited to: obtaining billing provider consent to transmit claims data abiding by respective state reporting mandates, and configuring a data relay platform to transmit claims data through the NCI secured portal in the ANSI Health Care Claim Transition Set (837) standard format.</p>
<p>Transmit a minimum of 36 months of retrospective claims data in the first data transmission, plus weekly submissions of current claims data, through the NCI secured portal in the ANSI Health Care Claim Transition Set (837) standard format.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES:<br />Provide the necessary information to the Contractor in order for them to complete Sections 3.0 and 5.0 of this Statement of Work.</p>
<p>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:<br />The Contractor shall deliver the following items within the Period of Performance stated in the order and as coordinated with the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR):</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE, DELIVERABLE DESCRIPTION / FORMAT REQUIREMENTS, DUE DATE<br />1, Weekly Transmission of claims from consenting providers submitted through the NCI secured portal. Data shall be in the ANSI Health Care Claim Transition Set (837) standard format. DUE DATE: Weekly from effective date of contract (Coordinate day of week with the NCI COR.)<br /><br />2, Configured installation of claims transmission conduits for new onboarding practice. Per direction of NCI COR, Final Report Report summarizing activities conducted during the period. Deliverable shall be submitted to the COR electronically in Microsoft compatible format, DUE DATE: by the expiration of the contract's Period of Performance.</p>
<p>INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:<br />The NCI COR will perform inspection and acceptance of services to be provided. Acceptance may be presumed unless otherwise indicated in writing by the NCI COR within 30 days of receipt.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Shall be twelve (12) months as stated in the order.</p>
<p>AWARD TYPE: <br />The award will be firm-fixed price, and made in the aggregate. <br /><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Contractor's work site.</p>
<p>PAYMENT:<br />NET 30 days (15 days for Small Business Concerns) from date of invoice. Payment shall be made in monthly increments after satisfactory completion and acceptance of the deliverables stated in Section 5.0. The Contractor shall be paid after satisfactory completion and acceptance of work provided. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoice to the NCI COR and NIH OFM Commercial Accounts per the attached Invoice and Payment Provisions. A copy of each invoice should be e-mailed to the NCI COR's contact information on the first page of the order.</p>
<p><br />These support services are provided by the Unlimited Technology Systems, LLC. The SEER program is interested in evaluating the long history of claims data to assess longitudinal treatment as well as progression and/or cancer recurrence. To do this, it is crucial to have a very long series of longitudinal claims data for the same cancer patient. The SEER program has previously obtained this claims data for a substantial number of cancer patients for the years 2013-2017 as follows:</p>
<p>SEER Area / Number of Oncology Practices (Providers)<br />Georgia / 85<br />Kentucky /&nbsp;2<br />Utah&nbsp;/ 25<br />Louisiana / 3<br />New Mexico / 25</p>
<p>The above providers process their oncology claims using Unlimited Technology Systems. Unlimited Technology Systems is the only provider with the specific oncology provider network that has access to the current subset of claims data for the same cancer patients. Obtaining this claims data for the same cancer patients is necessary to maintain the consistency of the longitudinal claims data that are reported to the SEER registries. Award of this contract to any other provider would result in access to a different network of oncology providers. This would compromise the consistency of longitudinal claims data by providing this data for a different group of cancer patients. Thus, it is reasonable for the NCI to conclude that its needs for this unique subset of provider claims data for the same cancer patients can only be satisfied by Unlimited Technology Systems.</p>
<p>Further, Unlimited Technology Systems has expended effort under related NCI contracts working with their network of providers to obtain consent to send this claims data to the respective SEER registries. In addition to obtaining consent, Unlimited Technology Systems expended effort under related NCI contracts working to establish the technical infrastructure required to transmit the data between the providers and SEER registries. Subsequently, it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the NCI's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:30PM ET, on July 31, 2018. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

<DESC><div>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure on a sole source basis support services to link the USRT cohort with the virtual pooled cancer registry database, from the University of Minnesota (UMN), Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, 420 Delaware Street S.E., 807 Mayo, Minneapolis, MN 55455.</div>
<div>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitionist.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</div>
<div>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute (NCI) carries out studies to characterize and quantify cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation exposures, improve radiation dosimetry, elucidate biological mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis, and study factors that may modify the carcinogenic action of radiation.  For more than 30 years the REB and the University of Minnesota have conducted a cohort study of cancer incidence and mortality among 146,022, primarily female (73%), U.S. radiologic technologists (USRT) to quantify radiogenic risks from protracted low dose exposures. Technologists included in the long-term follow-up study were first certified during 1926-1980 and resided in all U.S. states and territories.  Other studies of medical radiation workers have examined substantially smaller, mostly male, populations of radiologists and radiologic technologists.  Unique features of the USRT cohort are the availability of estimated annual occupational, personal medical, and ultraviolet radiation doses for each participant that have been corroborated by sizeable biodosimetry efforts.</div>
<div>The USRT cohort has been followed for cancer incidence and other disease outcomes since 1983.  Incident cancers were primarily identified via self-report on four questionnaire surveys conducted during 1983-1989, 1995-1998, 2003-2005, and 2012-2013, and, more recently, with linkage to state cancer registries.</div>
<div>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure support services for an ongoing radiation epidemiology cohort study of U.S. Radiologic Technologists (USRT).  The objectives of this proposed follow-on contract are to: (1) update cancer incidence in the USRT cohort based on additional cancer registry data received after the current contract expires and fully describe the methods used to identify and validate incident cancers over time; and (2) assist NCI in summarizing and interpreting findings based on VPR data and comparisons with self-reported cancer data.</div>
<div>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.  Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract with a twelve (12) month period of performance.  Work will be performed in two non-severable periods, a Base Period and one Option Period. These periods will overlap.</div>
<div>Base Period:  Update cohort cancer incidence data based on information received from additional state cancer registries participating in the Virtual Pooled Registry pending final negotiated data use agreements. This will involve receiving and reviewing cancer registry data files; reconciling the data with previously obtained cancer information; and transferring the data and detailed documentation to the NCI. Provide a detailed report, including an executive summary suitable for inclusion in a peer-reviewed publication, describing the methods used to identify and validate incident cancers identified from self-administered questionnaires during each of the study follow-up periods.</div>
<div>Option Period:  Assist NCI in summarizing and interpreting findings based on VPR data and comparisons with self-reported cancer data. This will involve reviewing, interpreting, and summarizing cancer registry linkage data; describing and interpreting the agreement and predictors of agreement between self-reported cancers and registry linkage-identified cancers; interpreting results from analyses that account for misclassification of cancer case ascertainment using questionnaire self-reported data and with registry linkage data; and interpreting findings from a comparison of risk models for breast cancer based on self-report and on registry linkage.</div>
<div>Qualifications needed to perform the proposed tasks are: (a) the contractor shall have access to the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study cohort database, including personal identifiers and historical cancer incidence data from questionnaires, medical reports, death certificates, and cancer registries; (b) the contractor shall have access to the certification records of the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, including updated certification and address information; and (c) the contractor have experience in developing and maintaining large databases for cohort follow-up studies, tracing large numbers of individuals, performing record linkage with large databases, confirming matches, evaluating cancers identified from multiple sources and ruling out duplicates, capturing and editing data, and developing and documenting data sets for analysis.</div>
<div>The University of Minnesota has been under contract to the NCI since 1982 to conduct USRT cohort follow-up, including administering four questionnaire surveys to collect information on work history, cancer and other disease risk factors, and cancer and other medical outcomes for assessing radiation-related and other risks. Because of their direct involvement in the conduct of all aspects of the USRT study for more than 30 years, staff from the University of Minnesota (UMN) have access to and intimate knowledge of all information contained within the comprehensive USRT study database.  The UMN maintains personal identifying information and protected health information for all USRT study participants and is charged by the UMN and NCI Institutional Review Boards that review and approve this study to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of these data.  The UMN has an established relationship with the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT), which certifies individuals in radiography, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and other medical radiation specialties.  The USRT cohort was initially identified and has been subsequently followed through certification and annual recertification records from the ARRT.  ARRT has granted UMN sole access to their historical certification and annual recertification records.  The UMN is uniquely qualified and, as the only organization with access to both the USRT and ARRT databases, is the only contractor able to perform the tasks described in the Statement of Work for this procurement.</div>
<div>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 5:00 PM ET, on July 26, 2018.  All responses and questions must be via email to Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer at miguel.diaz@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis toParker Hannifin Corporation (CAGE Code 59211) to acquire the following items:
<p>Wheel Half, Outer 162-17400 50 each<br />Wheel Half, Inner 161-17400 50 each</p>
<p><br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1. This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. Parker-Hannifin is the sole designer and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the wheel halves. As such, they hold the intellectual property rights and have the sole rights to fabricate the wheels and establish technical requirements for its components. There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the MK 105 since award of the system development and demonstration contract. No other source has the access, knowledge, or requisite production experience necessary to produce the required assemblies. Because of the lack of data and proprietary rights, selection of another vendor would require extensive, costly and time consuming reverse engineering and there is no guarantee that this would be successful as these assemblies are form, fit, function integrated into the aforementioned systems. Any changes to these wheels that may be caused by selection of another vendor may adversely affect the overall performance of MK-105 System. These drawings, design, and components of these wheels are owned by Parker Hannifin. Any redesign or reverse engineering will require significant government time and expense which is not reasonable considering the relatively low quantity of wheels needed and it is not expected to be recovered through competition. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase these wheel assemblies from Parker Hannifin Corporation. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed. The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. See attached clauses.</p>

<DESC><br />This notification is for issuance of a sole-source modification to contract N00173-14-C-6003 with Tekla Research, Inc. for a cost growth due to unanticipated surge in the burn rate for a research and development effort of the Navy's Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) System. Approximately one year after the competitive award of the Tekla contract, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated a program JOUNS-0010 to provide the DAIRCM system capabilities to the US Navy MH-60S, US Air Force HH-60G and US Army MH-6M aircraft. As a result of the surge requirements additional effort is required to complete the research and development effort within the specified term of the contract. <br /><br />This modification is being issued in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Tekla Research Incorporated is currently performing the research and development effort and has gained extensive, unmatched experience with the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) system during the current transition from development to a fielded system; as well as experience with additional, specialized hardware under development to augment the capabilities of DAIRCM once fielded. The high level of technical competence demonstrated by the contractor has been applied to many particular problems and projects in the world of ISR and EW, making it challenging to isolate and quantify the hour or dollar cost required to attain sufficient competence to meet the requirement. Notwithstanding that disclaimer, a reasonable estimate of the level of effort needed to attain the DAIRCM-specific competence, given a starting point of general competence in EO/IR EW and ISR technology, would be roughly 50,000 to 100,000 hours (5-6 years dedicated experience for one person in each of 5-8 areas of specialization. No other company has comparable experience bringing together the disparate technologies at the core of DAIRCM. Failure to award this modification to completion of the term of 24 August 2019 to Tekla Research Incorporated could have significant negative impacts on the development of this critical government technology and the JOUNS-0010 program. <br /><br />

<DESC><div>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, intends to issue a solicitation package seeking to award a firm fixed-price construction contract through the sealed bidding process for the renovations to an existing facility, Renovation 6B for New Dialysis at the Albany Stratton VA Medical Center. The facility is owned and operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The first phase of the project consists of the safe and coordinated replacement of two air handlers on the 11th floor B-wing, which&nbsp;serve four inpatient bed wards (7B, 8B, 9B, 10B), and extending new ductwork to include the 6th floor B-wing. The second phase of the project consists of the total demolition and renovation of the 6th floor B-wing for a new Chronic Dialysis unit.</div>
<p>Work will include: renovation of dialysis rooms, isolation rooms, nurse stations, sterile storage and clean holding rooms, reverse osmosis water treatment system, exam rooms, staff rooms, mechanical and electrical equipment rooms with the associated building infrastructure systems, rooftop mechanical space, and other supporting areas. The selective structural renovation will consist of modification and augmentation of the existing steel and reinforced concrete superstructure. While most of this project is fully designed, there are some aspects that are performance based where the Government will require a design submission from the&nbsp;bidder prior to start of construction. The total SF for the project is approximately 15,000 SF. The Albany Stratton VAMC facility will remain operational during construction so close coordination, phasing, and ICRA will be required.</p>

<SUBJECT>Emergency Maintenance Dredging of Moriches Inlet, New York, Federal Navigation Project
<SOLNBR>W912DS18B0011
<RESPDATE>051818
<CONTACT>Nicholas P. Emanuel, Phone 9177908069, Email Nicholas.P.Emanuel@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of Moriches Inlet, New York, Federal Navigation Project, including dredging the deposition basin. The dredged sand would be placed in a beneficial manner along the shoreline west of the west jetty. The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 300,000 cubic yards of sand from the Moriches Inlet and its deposition basin. Dredging would be required to a depth of -14 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable overdepth.
<p>The purpose of the proposed work is to alleviate the effects of shoaling and maintain the authorized project dimensions, thereby providing safe and economical use of the Moriches Inlet by commercial and recreational boating interests while providing beneficial use of the dredged sand. Between maintenance operations, the bypassed sand placed at the feeder beach would be carried by littoral drift to feed down drift beaches. The maintenance operation would thus serve to place sand trapped in the channel back into the normal littoral movement that naturally replenishes the western beaches, while maintaining a safe channel for navigation.</p>
<p>Maintenance dredging of the channel and deposition basin at Moriches Inlet will be accomplished by pipeline dredge, hopper dredge or similar plant. The entire channel will generally not require maintenance dredging; only areas where shoaling has reduced the depth of the channel will require dredging. The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and approved local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, and to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than forty-eight (48) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed (NTP). The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 12,000 cubic yards per calendar day.</p>
<p>The work is estimated to cost between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Plans and specifications for the subject project will be available on or about 3 May 2018, with bid opening in June 2018. It is the intention of the government to award in June 2018 and issue the NTP in July 2018.</p>
<p>Public notice was posted on April 18 2018 and closes on April 27 2018.</p>
<p>Liquidated Damages of $1,835.00 per calendar day of delay will be assessed to the contractor until all work under the contract is accepted as complete.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted Procurement.</p>

Contractor will furnish equipment to load and transport the rock, and a large excavator equipped with a bucket thumb to precisely place the large stone in the channel.  In order to reach the farthest extent of the barbs, it will be necessary for the contractor to bench the levee, to create a pad sufficient for the excavator to safely place the stone.  The contractor's equipment must be in good working condition, with no leaks, as the work area is within the class 1 waters of the Snake River.</p>
