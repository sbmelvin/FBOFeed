<DESC>The Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) of the New Mexico VA Health Care System (NMVAHCS), 2401 Centre Avenue SE, Albuquerque NM 87106 is planning to negotiate a sole source purchase from Smith Detection for an Ionscan HP1 upgrade.  The upgrade includes:  The IONSCAN®-LS which detects and quantitates trace analytes using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  The Ultra-fast analysis with the IONSCAN-LS offers the advantages of simplicity, selectivity, sensitivity and ease-of-use operation at atmospheric pressure.  The IONSCAN®-LS offers two different sample introduction methods: thermal desorption and high-performance injection (HPI).  The HPI offers multi-stage temperature and flow programming with split/splitless injection capabilities. The availability of these two techniques maximizes the breadth of compounds that can be analyzed successfully.  The Center currently owns and operates an Ionscan.  An upgrade is required for increasing stability studies.  This upgrade into the Center’s quality operation will enhance the quality of our product.    Smiths Detection, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and provider of the IONSCAN®-LS ion mobility spectrometer and High-Performance Injection accessory.   Since Smith Detection is the manufacturer of this equipment, they are the owner of the diagrams, manuals, proprietary parts, specifications and most importantly the validation protocols and as such the only company capable of offering the upgrade.  This is considered to be sole source because of the foregoing statements, all of which are vital considerations in determining the upgrade that best meets this facility’s needs.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest to the Contracting Officer no later than 1400 Mountain Standard Time, September 7, 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the action based on responses is solely within the Government’s discretion. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive proposal.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NMVAHCS.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (505) 248-3206.

This system is a combination of a blender drive system to which is attached blending vessels onto a single drive shaft.  It also include an A 3 cubic feet volume vessel and an Installation/Operational Protocol.  The drive system is mounted on casters for easy transportability.  The system is fully capable of wash-down operations.  The metal parts are 304 stainless steel, for non-product contact parts, and are 316 stainless steel for product contact parts.  The design, construction and parts all meet current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) stipulations.  Patterson-Kelly is the sole manufacturer and provider of the Model P-K MVP 50 Blending System with a High Speed Intensifier Bar.  Since Patterson-Kelly is the manufacturer of this system they are the owner of the diagrams, manuals, proprietary parts, specifications and most importantly the validation protocols and as such the only company capable of offering this system.  This is considered to be sole source because the electronic control system operates via an operator interface and can be expanded to allow interfacing with other  CSPCRPCC devices and databases.  The combination of the unique multiple vessel accommodation and the mobility of the whole system are essential to operations of this facility because it allows CSPCRPCC to manufacturer a wide variety of drug products and produce a wide range of batch sizes for future research projects.

<SUBJECT>A -- Predictive Analysis For Naval Deployment Activities (PANDA)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-44
<RESPDATE>101705
<ARCHDATE>10312005
<CONTACT>Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email mblackstone@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Predictive Analysis for Naval Deployment Activities (PANDA) program under this Broad Agency Announcement(BAA).

BACKGROUND:  The current CONOPS for achieving situation awareness in the maritime domain calls for close monitoring of those entities that we already have reason to be concerned about (i.e., we already suspect are threats or which carry cargos that could be dangerous in the hands of the wrong people). This CONOPS is based on the Cold War model where we had the luxury of focusing on a small number of known hostile entities. The successes of the past were achieved by devoting billions of dollars and millions of person-years to manually track and understand the activities of this small number of entities. In today’s Global War on Terror, where a threat can emerge from any number of platforms, we no longer have this luxury. The goal of PANDA is to automatically evaluate the behavior of all larger surface maritime vessels (not just those that we are already concerned about), to determine which ones are deviating from their normal, expected behavior in ways that may be indicative of an emerging threat.

PANDA will advance technologies and develop an architecture that will alert watchstanders to anomalous ship behavior as it occurs, allowing them to detect potentially dangerous or harmful behavior before it causes harm. These technologies and systems will be transitioned to various partners and customers throughout the development process, ensuring that the end product meets the needs of the services and watchstanders. Participants will work closely with the transition partners to aid in this process.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  The PANDA program has three objectives:   First, automatically learn motion-based activity patterns from long-duration tracks and associated data. Second, automatically perform motion-based change detection. Third, provide anticipatory situation awareness and threat assessment to watchstanders across multiple echelons.

It is envisioned that the PANDA technology components and system developed to meet those objectives will be designed to operate in a distributed, services-oriented architecture (SOA) consistent with the US Navy’s current FORCENet acquisition policy. Additionally, PANDA will be exercised against real data in a testbed via a series of carefully designed experiments to assess the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of both the integrated system and the components. These assessments will involve integrating the PANDA components, both with one another and with the testbed, along with experiment planning, execution, and analysis to objectively measure progress toward program goals. The testbed itself, along with relevant subject matter experts, will be provided by the government.

Proposers should strive to develop the highest level of accuracy, robustness, and automation possible for PANDA technology components and the overall system, recognizing that they will always be supervised by analysts and watchstanders. In particular, the Government is interested in solutions to the following technical components:

•	Motion-Based Pattern Learning (MPL):  Design and construct a system that learns motion-based activity models for individual, groups, and/or classes of vessels. This system should integrate local and global learning. Demonstrate increases in robustness, flexibility, and computational efficiency as the program progresses. 
•	Prediction and Activity Monitoring (PAM):  Design and construct a vessel prediction and activity monitoring function, which compares the incoming and emerging vessel tracks/behaviors with the existing vessel patterns and can determine if the current behavior is consistent with the learned pattern. Demonstrate increases in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency as the program progresses.
•	Adaptive Context Modeling (ACM):  Design and construct a component that learns, maintains, and efficiently stores “business process” models related to variations in surface maritime ship behavior as well as suspicious behaviors. Models can be entered manually by an analyst/watchstander or learned by the system by observing a watchstander’s activities in resolving previously unknown anomalies. Demonstrate increases in robustness, flexibility, and computational efficiency as the program progresses.
•	Anomaly Processing and Presentation (APP):  Design and construct a component that compares anomalies generated by PAM to the anomaly data base to determine if the anomaly is an emerging threat or not, and present the results to an analyst/watchstander for them to review or manually resolve. Demonstrate increases in robustness, flexibility, and computational efficiency as the program progresses.

In addition to the four technical components listed above, this effort requires support for activities related to System Engineering and Integration (SEI) and Performance Evaluation (PE).

For planning purposes, assume this effort starts 1 February 2006. The objective of this phased approach is to incrementally deliver technical components, integrate those components, and evaluate those components and the overall system. As the program progresses, the focus of each phase will change to ensure the Program Metrics are met and a fully integrated, transitionable system is produced. Each phase builds on the work of the previous phase or phases. The high-level objectives for each program phase are as follows:
•	Phase I – Learning and Detection:  Demonstrate that individual and class-of-vessel motion-based activity patterns can be learned and used to detect anomalies; use patterns to predict movements and classify (groups of) vessels as potentially (non)hostile with a low incidence of false alarms; learn and detect multi-ship correlated activities; incorporate initial context models. Scale: To be specified by the proposer but no less than 1,000 vessels.
•	Phase II – Automation: Increase number of patterns detected (to be specified by the proposer, but at least an order of magnitude increase expected) and speed of detection (rapid relearning in response to sudden changes); improve accuracy of detection and classification of anomalies; automate integration technology component (MPL, PAM, ACM, APP) outputs.
•	Phase III – Integration: Increase number of patterns detected (to be specified by the proposer, but at least an order of magnitude increase expected) and speed of detection (learn on several exemplars); improve accuracy of detection and classification of anomalies; integrate across nodes for simultaneously function at multiple locations.
•	Phase IV – Technology Scaling and Transition:  Leverage future detection/tracking capabilities to expand system to smaller (harbor) vessels (scale equal to world traffic); increase number of patterns detected; improve accuracy of detection and classification of anomalies; harden and transition PANDA system.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/ scientific/ business decision process, with technical and scientific considerations being most important. Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) Overall technical and scientific merit, innovation, and depth; (2) Relevance to PANDA mission objectives and program concepts; (3) Personnel and corporate capabilities and experience; (4) Proposed schedule and metrics per Phase; (5) Project and technology transfer plans and potential transformative impact on military operations; and (6) Cost realism and value of proposed work to the Government. Further details may be found in the PIP, which can be accessed at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address provided in the next section.


GENERAL INFORMATION:  A Briefing to Industry (BTI) is scheduled for 16 September 2005 to be held at: MITRE facility, 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA 22102-7508. The BTI will be classified SECRET/SCI and will cover the following topics: general overview of the PANDA program; contractual issues; proposal instructions; information on the PANDA problem domain, data, and technical and system aspects; and Q&A. Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to one person per organization; if space permits, the government may elect to allow additional attendees. Additional information on the PANDA BTI may be found at:  http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/PANDA/index.htm. Pre-registration for the PANDA BTI is required. The deadline for pre-registration is 9 September 2005 via the World Wide Web (WWW) at https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/bti/. Instructions for passing classified visit requests will be provided to PANDA BTI registrants. All pertinent information and materials presented at the UNCLASSIFIED session of the PANDA BTI will be made available at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/PANDA/index.htm. 

PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:  DARPA is expecting to receive CLASSIFIED and UNCLASSIFIED proposal submissions for this effort. If a CLASSIFIED proposal is planned, please follow the necessary submission guidelines that are provided in the Proposer’s Information Package (PIP) for BAA 05-44 at: http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/PANDA/index.htm, in particular those defined in Section B.4 (SECURITY AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES). Proposers must be willing to cooperate and exchange software, data, and other information with other contractors in a manner that contributes to the success of the program. This includes routine coordination with other contractors or integrator, selected by DARPA, if appropriate. A statement of cooperation must be included in the final proposal.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source modification to MCI Telecommunications Corporation, 8200 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102-3803.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of work performed under contract DCA200-96-D-0096 that was competitively awarded to MCI on 28 August 1996.  The proposed modification provides an extension of services, via option periods, through August 2008.  The contract provides common-user voice switched services (at 12 locations), dedicated bandwidth manager services (at 35 locations), network management services, and end-to-end (user-to-user) provisioning.  The bandwidth managers connect backbone and access transmission in the DISN network to efficiently meet user requirements.  This proposed contract action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow rapid extension to deployed military forces anywhere in the world.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  Follow-on actions for replacement services are in process within the DISN Next Generation Program Office (DNG PO).  The anticipated award is second quarter FY2006.  This modification provides continued support until those contracts are in place and transition can be accomplished.  MCI is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>Procurement action being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. The National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center intends to award a sole-source commercial purchase order to Belsco Inc., 213 E. Verot School Rd., Lafayette, LA 70508-3311 for the following items: Forty (40) P226 Simunitions Kits, Two Hundred (200) M4 Spare Magazine for FX Cart, and Forty (40) M4A1 FX Uppers w/out carry handle.  Belsco Inc. is the only known source that can provide the product required. This sole source is based compatibility with existing munitions. Extensive testing of these products has been conducted by NNSA to determine that they alone meet mission needs. The Department of Energy intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source.  Any change would be cost prohibitive. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service as described above. Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, as to why they should be considered. All interested firms must respond by September 16, 2005, 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time to Agustin Archuleta, REF: DE-AF52-05NA26800, NNSA Service Center, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185, fax (505) 284-7920. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NNSA SC will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures for two (2) sets of static balancing equipment for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) propellers to Marvel Manufacturing Company of Kinnelon, NJ.  This equipment will be provided to Assault Craft Units Four and Five to conduct organizational level maintenance on the LCACs. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The original equipment manufacturer  (OEM) of the LCAC propellers, Dowty Aerospace, identifies the static balancing equipment from Marvel Manufacturing Company in their installation and repair procedures for the propellers. Additionally, each Assault Craft Unit already has one set of this equipment. Providing the same equipment allows common parts already on-hand to be used in maintaining the balancing equipment and eliminates the need for additional operato! r training if a different brand were used.  NAICS Code 334519 applies. FSC is 3695. A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this simplified acquisition.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 09, France for data and biological samples from the IARC’s case-control study in the Golestan Province, Iran.  The NEB conducts intramural research in areas related to nutrition and cancer which are aimed at lowering human cancer risk. One focus of NEB research is esophageal cancer, especially in high-risk populations. NEB scientists have performed studies of esophageal cancer in high-risk areas of China for over 15 years. An area of South Asia from the Caspian Sea to Northwestern China has been identified as the South Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt because the population throughout this region is at elevated risk of esophageal cancer.  The Western edge of this belt is Golestan Province, in Northeastern Iran.  This population was studied by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in the 1970s, and IARC has recently re-started studies in this region, including collaborative involvement in a case-control study in Golestan Province.  After one year of recruitment in this study, 100 cases and 200 controls have been enrolled.  IARC will:  1) anonymize all data and biological specimens, so they cannot be linked to individuals;  2)  provide questionnaire data on 100 cases and 200 matched controls collected in Golestan Province, Iran during the prior year;  3) provide pathologic data on all of these subjects who have been endoscopically examined;  4)  provide one diagnostic HE-stained tissue section of esophageal cancers found in these subjects;  and 5)  provide one 2ml serum aliquot and genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells from all of these subjects. This data will aid the NEB in understanding the causes of ESCC in this high-risk population and will allow the NEB to make comparisons between high-risk areas in China and the South Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt.  IARC is the only major research institution conducting a population-based study of esophageal cancer in the South Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt, and is therefore, the only source for data and biological samples from this area.  IARC has a long history of quality research activities, including research in this area of Iran, and the data and samples they collected and are providing are of high quality and will be comparable to data and samples collected by NEB research studies in China.  The comparison of results from these two area, which are very different geographically, culturally and ethnically, will be a valuable resource for identifying etiologic risk factors for this disease that are important throughout the world.  IARC is the only source known to the NCI researcher that can provide the necessary data and biological samples from the Golestan Province of South Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 12, 2005. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<SOLNBR>NCI-50164-NG
<RESPDATE>091205

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Microdissecting and evaluating RNA from the SUCCEED study to define host and viral gene expression patterns of specific cervix cell population and disease status with The University of Wisconsin – Madison, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, WI  53706-1596.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) is being conducted to identify host and viral biomarkers that would molecularly distinguish women “at risk” of progressive cervical neoplasia.  The purpose of SUCCEED is to identify biomarkers that would distinguish those women who will progress to cervical neoplasia from the majority that will not.  Especially pertinent to the success of the study is the ability to understand the distinctive molecular events that occur in each cervix, comparing tumor cells to parts of the cervix that appear normal.  The specific objective of this procurement is to evaluate a sample of SUCCEED tissue specimens collected to date and conduct detailed processing and evaluation of tissue quality, macromolecule recovery (RNA and DNA), and use of recovered macromolecules for relevant assays, namely the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 human genome microarray and the University of Wisconsin at Madison’s in-house human papillomavirus expression array.  At present, NCI is unable to predict with any accuracy which HPV infections will progress and which will be among the majority that regress.  The purpose of SUCCEED is to therefore identify host and viral biomarkers that would distinguish those women who will proceed to cervical neoplasia from the majority that will not.  

The University of Wisconsin at Madison presently constructs an in-house HPV array chip that contains 70-mer oligonucleotide probes for all genes of all 37 sequenced mucosotropic HPV genotypes as well as a few selected host genes. The chip has been verified and optimized with various known samples including: HPV-expressing keratinocyte cell lines (NIKS, W12, CaSki), oral cancer-driven cell lines, and primary cancer tissue, showing reliable determination of HPV gene expression and genotypes.  Additional capabilities include the detection of non-integrated HPV DNA and the ability to add additional probes as desired, such as spliced mRNA junctions.  This HPV chip is produced solely by the University of Wisconsin and the utilization of this chip is critical to the proposed analysis of SUCCEED specimens for host and viral expression. 

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 12, 2005.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with PANalytical Inc., to purchase an X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer to accurately analyze small volumes of solid materials from corrosion and drinking water treatment studies for elemental composition.  The current NAICS code is 334516 for this requirement.   Based on EPA's knowledge of the X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer, there are features covered in the specifications that may have unique  capabilities to particular vendors.  These features include: "	SST maX Tube Technology to prevent intensity loss for light elements (B to Ca) as the tube ages, and the capability to attain 4 kW power and 160 mA tube current. "	PE(002) and Ge(111) curved crystals to improve resolution and intensity  significantly for Si, Al, P, S and Cl, all key analytical elements of interest in our research "	Unique helium flushing system that does not use shutters and does not keep a partial vacuum, eliminating the risk of rupturing or damaging sample cells (liquid and powders) during analysis "	Special  dust collection kit to protect against contamination from dust and sample particles, saving possible costly repair and service calls common to other instruments "	Ultra-precise sample introduction system that incorporates a highly precise turret and loading system allowing for better run-to-run  precision and accuracy throughout a long analytical lifetime of the instrument "	Sealed Xenon detector and flow detector combination, to optimize analyses of transition metals, which are of a critical nature for EPA studies. "	Pro-Trace Analysis Package:  This is a very special unique quantitative  analysis package that combines both software and special standards for accurate quantification close to the theoretical detection limit of the instrument.  This is critical to obtain the combination of precision and accuracy across the wide range of atomic numbers of elements and concentrations  (trace to high percentages) that are the norm rather than the exception in our corrosion and arsenic research studies, and for which commercial solid standards for calibration and quality control (typically used by software from other vendors) do not exist.  This also greatly improves analytical  efficiency without sacrificing accuracy by uniquely enabling trace level analyses to be done without requiring major element analyses, which may also require different sample preparation techniques and additional analytical runs. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's  requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses  to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your  request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

The mandatory requirements for the film are as follows:  the film must have an estar base which by design is tough, very hard to tear or break, does not become brittle when subjected to cold temperature and will withstand the force applied to the film when the high speed cameras are operated at a frame rate of 500 frames per second,  the film must have sprocket holes on both sides of the film with 0.2994-inch (short) pitch used in standard film rate (24 frames per second) cameras.  The required film will be used in cameras that are mounted externally on the aircraft and become subjected to extremely cold temperatures, thus requiring the estar base film.  The standard base film is acetate, which becomes very brittle and breaks easily when subjected to cold temperatures making it completely unsatisfactory for high frame rate operation and cold environment.   These mandatory requirements must be met in order for the film to be compatible with existing cameras.  The Government reserves the right to process this procurement on a Sole Source basis.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This notice of intent closes 9-15-05.

Industrial Toxic Products Reduction Program in the State of São Paulo. The Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental (CETESB), the Grantee, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for CETESB, the environmental protection agency for the State of São Paulo.  The objective of the Technical Assistance is to develop up to three alternative implementation plans, budgets, and schedules that can be used by CETESB to carry out a program to reduce the use of industrial toxic products in the State of São Paulo.

CETESB monitors pollution in air, water and soil through a network of 151 monitoring stations throughout the state that are connected through a centralized automated system.  There are an additional 141 monitoring points along Sao Paulo’s coastline to monitor water quality on the beaches.  In addition, CETESB conducts random audits of companies to inspect their input and output of industrial pollutants.  

CETESB requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding to develop a strategy and implementation plan to address toxic pollutants in the state.  The specific tasks of the technical assistance can be summarized as follows:

1.	Review the Experience of Toxic Reduction Programs in Other Countries.
2.	Analyze Toxic Industrial Substances in the State of São Paulo.
3.	Conduct Toxic Product Assessment.
4.	Develop Case Studies.
5.	Review Institutional and Legal Aspects.
6.	Review and Recommend Economic Incentives.
7.	Assess Environmental and Development Impacts.
8.	Develop Implementation Plan.
9.	Organize Technical Seminars.
10.	Prepare Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $448,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<DESC>The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM) has positioned itself at the center of advanced manufacturing activity.  This unique position allows them to perform rigorous policy research with special expertise in manufacturing, research and technology development, skills standards and workforce development.  NACFAM’s long-standing relationships with the manufacturing community has given them the ability to move in this industry with ease and to obtain and develop information in an expedient and cost effective manner.  NACFAM’s ability to deliver cost effective information is paramount when considering the legwork and associated costs other vendors may encounter when gathering the same information.   Furthermore, NACFAM’s established relationship with NIST, through NIST’s membership for the development of these industry relationships, have established a strategic link between manufacturing businesses, NIST and NACFAM.  Contracting directly with NACFAM will produce the required study results that will be widely disseminated, and respected by key leaders in government, industry, and academia.   The anticipated period of performance will be one year with four option years.  It is our opinion that competing this requirement and awarding to other than NACFAM will result in a duplication of effort.  Any possible savings from competition would be offset by the duplication of effort, learning curve and risk of delay. Interested persons may identify their interest no later than September 12, 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Nikon Confocal Systems of Melville, NY, for a confocal scanner to be integrated into NIST’s existing microscope.   

NIST uses a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope as the foundation for Optical Nanomanipulation Research.  For nanoassembly and nanobiology studies, NIST requires increased resolution and the ability to take optical sections of 3D specimens—the two prime advantages that confocal scanners provide.  Since the confocal scanner becomes an integral part of the microscope system, it must be optimized to match the microscope optics.  

Sole source determination is based on the following:  
(1) The Nikon Confocal System is the only system that can be retrofit onto an existing microscope, and that is optimized for the Nikon optics so that highest resolution can be obtained;
(2) While Nikon Confocal Systems is the sole manufacturer of this system, they do have dealers for their microscope systems.  However, for the confocal scanners, Nikon deals directly with customers due to issues of complexity and integration.    

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by September 7, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Corning Tropel of Fairport, NY for a 193 nm objective lens.   

The objective lens must be catadioptric and tuned for the 193.3 nm line useable with a standard excimer laser.  The objective must have a minimum numerical aperture of 0.745 with a field size of 120 micrometers.  The numerical aperture requirement is critical to high resolution performance requirements.  The objective must be infinity corrected with the appropriate tube lenses available in the 193 nm range.

Sole source determination is based on Corning Tropel being the sole manufacturer and provider of a lens which can meet all of NIST’s minimum specifications.  Specifically, the lens can be used as an objective AND an illumination lens; AND the lens can meet the 193 nm requirement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by September 7, 2005, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch (MB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for a BD FACSCalibur from BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  One of the MB’s research programs is to develop novel therapies for the treatment of lymphomas and HTLV-1 associated diseases.  These therapies include diagnostic microarray analyses and clinical treatments using monoclonal antibodies that are monitored by the FDA and managed under investigator sponsored IND’s.  Many of their clinical and basic research programs involve direct characterization of in vivo mononuclear cell populations by phenotypic analysis via flow cytometry.  The MB’s current Becton Dickinson Flow Cytometer frequently breaks down and is no longer supported by Becton Dickinson.  Due to the Metabolism Branch’s on-going research projects including clinical treatment protocols currently underway they must purchase their new flow cytometer with 4 color/ 6 parameter dual laser capability from BD Biosciences.  The system includes an enclosed sample application as a safety requirement when handling retroviral (HTLV-1) cells.  BD Biosciences is the only company that can provide the required flow cytometric analysis system necessary due to this specific machine being required in the MB’s current ongoing FDA approved patient studies involving clinical data which must be evaluated and monitored by the same analytical equipment and data sets.  The research projects are already established and can be transferred directly to the new system from the old with no loss of research time, or delays in clinical treatments.  BD Biosciences is the only source known to the NCI researcher that can supply a Flow Cytometer that can support its on-going research as described above. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on September 9, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with David Elder, Philadelphia, PA 19130-3206 for:  Expert Slide Diagnoses.   This contract will be for a base year plus one (1) one-year option.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background:  The Genetic Epidemiology Branch is a member of the Melanoma Genetics Consortium (MGC), which is a group of familial melanoma researchers from the U.S. and several other countries. The purpose of this procurement is to provide a mechanism for the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) to have familial melanoma study pigmented lesion pathology material reviewed by an expert dermatopathologist to ensure GEB’s participation in the Melanoma Genetics Consortium.  The overall objectives of the procurement are to rigorously review pigmented lesion pathology material according to Consortium criteria and to generate pathology reports containing the variables and format needed for the Consortium. The contractor shall review pigmented lesion (melanomas and moles) pathology material for the Genetic Epidemiology Branch’s study of familial melanoma and participation in the Melanoma Genetics Consortium, and report his findings to the project officer.  The report shall contain a description of the biologic and pathologic features of the pigment and surrounding cells in the mole and melanoma pathology material submitted to the contractor.  Contractor shall analyze the pathology material of all melanomas and moles (approximately 124 lesions) removed from GEB melanoma study participants whose data are being contributed to the MGC.  Contractor shall evaluate the lesions based on a panel of variables and pathologic criteria that are required for the MGC’s data analyses.  For melanomas, these criteria include type, thickness of invasion into the skin, determination of dysplasia, and several other criteria.  For moles, the criteria include type, presence and degree of dysplasia, and other cellular features.  Contractor shall verify the diagnoses of melanoma, dysplastic nevi or other atypical nevi on all pigmented lesions to ensure that the GEB familial melanoma study pathology data meets the format required by the MGC. Contractor shall provide GEB with attached written pathology reports and data forms of his findings within 1-2 weeks after each pathology review, depending upon their complexity.  These reports and data forms shall serve the research purposes of the GEB, and ensure that the pathology review parameters and data are consistent with the criteria and format required by the MGC. Contractor is the Principal Investigator of the Melanoma Genetics Consortium grant.  He is a certified specialist in dermatopathology by the American Board of Pathology.  It is essential for GEB’s participation in the Melanoma Genetics Consortium to have our study participants’ pathology material reviewed by the contractor to ensure that the pathology reviews and data are consistent with the criteria and format required by the Melanoma Genetics Consortium. For these analyses, it is crucial that consistency of data within the Consortium be achieved.  All pigmented lesion (melanomas and moles) pathology material from members of melanoma-prone families being studied by the Genetic Epidemiology Branch must be reviewed by the Principal Investigator, the contractor, an expert pathologist, to ensure that study participants are categorized with the correct diagnoses, and that the features all of the pigmented lesions are reviewed consistently to meet the data requirements for the Consortium’s studies.  Contractor is the only known source to the NCI that can successfully complete this project. This is a notice of intent not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT on September 9, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology, plans to procure on a sole source basis for a PixCell II to Pix Cell IIe Upgrade for an existing Laser Capture Microscopy (LCM) system with Arcturus Engineering, Inc, 1220 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, CA. The Laboratory of Pathology has been working to identify and characterize the protein signatures of human cancer cells and tissues and to apply proteomics technologies directly to patient diagnosis, toxicity monitoring, and therapeutic intervention.  Laser capture microdissection has been developed by the NCI to provide a rapid, reliable method to procure pure specified cells from specific microscopic regions of tissue sections for subsequent quantitative, multiplex molecular analysis.  The original equipment used in the core facility, consisting of three fully equipped LCM systems, was purchased from Arcturus Engineering Inc. in 1999. This equipment has been an extremely valuable resource for numerous researchers; however, upgrades are required in order for the units to be functional with existing computer interfaces in use in the laboratory. The three LCM systems shall be upgraded from PixCell II to PixCell IIe.  Only Arcturus, the manufacturer of this equipment, can perform the required upgrade. There is no other source known to the NCI researcher for this product. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115 to continue to provide PTEN expression and EIN diagnosis in an on-going study of endometrial lesion progression.  DCEG has a case-control study, nested within a large retrospective cohort studying the diagnostic classification and subsequent risk of cancer in endometrial cancer precursors.  Two important areas of research are PTEN expression as a potential marker of high-risk lesions and the potential utility of EIN classification system. Brigham and Women’s Hospital will: 1) Determine PTEN expression status via immunohistochemistry (IHC) for study cases’ index biopsies and study controls’ index biopsies by performing PTEN immunohistochemistry on newly cut slides from approximately 538 tissue blocks (188 from study cases and approximately 350 from study controls); 2) Interpret and score adequate samples according to PTEN expression; and 3) Assign a diagnosis from the EIN classification system to the original H&E slides from the index biopsies and subsequent biopsies from all study cases and controls.  Dr. Mutter at Brigham and Women’s Hospital is widely recognized as an expert.  He developed and has extensively validated interpretive criteria and mutational concordance for a paraffin based PTEN immunohistochemical assay and his experience in using PTEN antibody 6h2.1 for the described experiments is unmatched.  Brigham and Women’s Hospital is the only vendor known to the DCEG that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:30 p.m. EDT, on September 9, 2005. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service in Albany, California has a requirement for a fully automated dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) system.  This unit must quantify evaporation and re-condensation of water vapor as the governing heat and moisture transfer mechanism in porous samples.  Critical parameter measurements to achieve objectives are: heats of sorption and desorption, the rate at which equilibrium is established, and the kinetics of water vapor transfer, internal moisture uptake, and internal evaporation.  This DVS instrument must be capable of measuring the weight of samples and relative humidity of the surrounding closed environment simultaneously as well as the rate at which equilibrium is established.  Must consist of a highly sensitive digital microbalance (1.5g capacity and 0.1 ug sensitivity) with symmetrically heated and buoyancy compensated gas flow configuration for both absolute and differential sample measurements, temperature range of 5 – 60 degrees C, advanced fully-automated humidity control system (0 –98% RH) with precision thermal conductivity mass flow controllers and dual-channel temperature/humidity sensors, and constant temperature research-grade enclosure. This relative humidity control range covers the sorption region of the samples being studied.  Temperature accuracy must be +/- 1C and humidity accuracy +/- 1RH.  Instrument measurements must provide more accurate readings than the classic method of using dessicators or water activity meters.  Also, the measurements of the rate at which equilibrium is being established must provide significant insight into the energy necessary for evaporation, energy released upon partial condensation, and vapor pressure within the sample at a non-equilibrium state.  Live data export for data plotting and analysis, and real-time display of experiment progress.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Four results are considered necessary to achieve the Project Objective – to reduce fertility and improve health outcomes of mothers and newborns: 1) Increased Use of Quality Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services at the Primary Health Care (PHC) Level; 2) Increased use of Quality Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services in Hospitals; 3) Positive Behavior Change in Target Communities; and 4) Improved MOHP Capacity to Sustain Performance of Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services. 

The relative emphasis of interventions will be tailored to the needs of Upper and Lower Egypt and to rural and urban poor populations.  In Upper Egypt key technical interventions include improving the quality and use of integrated MCH/FP/RH services in primary health clinics; sustaining previous improvements in hospital-based maternal and neonatal services through periodic, demand-driven technical assistance; adding FP information, counseling and services to all district hospital postpartum care and post-abortion care programs; and mobilizing communities.  In Lower Egypt technical interventions include improving the quality and use of hospital-based maternal and neonatal services; improving the quality and use of integrated MCH/FP/RH services in selected primary health facilities; and mobilizing communities. 

Behavior change activities, to be carried out in close collaboration with USAID/Egypt’s Communication for Healthy Living (CHL) Project, will include: 1) mobilizing health personnel to adopt behaviors and interpersonal communication skills that improve the quality of health care provided; 2) mobilizing individuals, families, groups and communities to use health services and to adopt healthy MCH/FP/RH behaviors; and 3) mobilizing community members, including business, to provide services and supplies to improve and maintain health facilities. 
 
To improve capacity of the MOHP, the Contractor will also provide technical assistance and training at all levels of the health system – national, governorate, district and facility levels – to sustain the high performance of priority MCH/FP/RH programs.  The Contractor will be expected to provide support for operational approaches which strengthen performance and improve management and organizational capacity in order to carry priority MCH/FP/RH programs forward without further assistance.  Where needed, the Contractor will assist the MOHP with facility upgrades, including renovation of primary health care clinics (primarily in Upper Egypt, with selected clinics in Lower Egypt) and neonatal care and hospital units essential for safe motherhood activities (primarily in Lower Egypt).

One direct contract will be awarded to carry out all activities under the main results listed above and fully bring together the two technical components of MCH and FP/RH.  Implementation under the contract will occur over five years.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.

<DESC>Note:  Contact Information has chaged as of August 31, 2005 to the above parties. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs. The growing use of unmanned systems in the air, on the ground, or underwater continually demonstrates new possibilities/capabilities to maintain our naval forces’ maritime superiority around the world. One can conceive scenarios where UUVs sense, track, identify, target, and destroy an enemy -- all autonomously within the full net-centric battlespace. The long-term UUV vision is to have the capability to (1) deploy or retrieve devices; (2) gather, transmit, and act on all types of information; and (3) engage bottom, volume, surface, air or land targets.  To this end, the Navy is soliciting proposals in the following areas:  (1)	Autonomy. Autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, and remaining energy on-board. Additional needed capabilities include the need to avoid obstacles and entanglements, to react to changes in ambient conditions, and to engage in group behavior when multiple UUVs act as a team.  (2)	Energy and Propulsion. Low-cost, high energy density, reliable, safe, long-duration easily recharged or refueled power sources are needed. Energy source for air-independent power is desired to minimize the size, cost, and signature of the energy and propulsion system. Advanced energy and propulsion, in combination with other UUV technologies, will enable the use of smaller vehicles that reduce cost in the long term while providing greater performance.  (3)	Advanced Sensors and Sensors Processing. All UUV missions depend on the effective use of sensors. Development in the sensor area needs to be concentrated in increasing area coverage rate (ACR), improving classification and identification capabilities, employment and packaging of low-power electronics, non-traditional tracking techniques, and multi-threat chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, and explosive (CBNRE) sensors.  (4)	Communications and Networking. Real-time, or near real-time, RF communications of sensor data from the vehicle in operational sea states is needed. Acoustic or other (e.g. laser) underwater communication technologies to provide communications at useful data rates and provide navigation aids on demand are desired.  (5)	Launch and Recovery. Launch and Recovery (L&R) is a key feature of any UUV system, and it is closely related to the vehicle size and host platform characteristics. Development of innovative multi-platform L&R concepts, as well as deployment and possible recovery of payloads from host UUV, are desired.     (6)	Engagement and Intervention. The development of technology is necessary to support net extraction. Engagement and intervention techniques are required for a wide range of missions, particularly those requiring long transits and interactions with targets. The UUV missions envisioned may require solutions that range from non-lethal to neutralization.  (7)	Modeling and Simulation. Modeling and simulation are needed for UUV mission planning and reconstruction, vehicle testing, software design and testing, and training. This BAA will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts and “other transactions” may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability. Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged. Navy evaluation will commence after 1 March 2005 and initial awards are anticipated in third quarter FY05. Proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 02633, James E. Watkins, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E., Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20376.  Contracting Point of Contact is James E. Watkins, telephone (202) 781-3957, e-mail WatkinsJE@navsea.navy.mil. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.     Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and ten electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).  Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, and!  cost. The technical proposal is limited to 20 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (paragraph (7), below) and cost information, which has no page limit. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.  The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:  (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed technologies and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they will contribute to and support the objectives of a technology evaluation and demonstration; (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts of the concept with appropriate elaboration as to the ingenuity associated with the co! ncept. This section shall not exceed 10 pages. (4) A summary of the deliverables including data associated with the proposed research. (5) A summary of the schedule and milestones for the proposed effort that can be traced to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). (6) A one-page WBS. (7) A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific contractor requirements. The statement of work should only document the specific work to be performed as discussed in section (3) above. Any disclosure of information as relating to the merits of the concept included in the Statement of Work but not included in the detailed technical proposal required by paragraph (3) above will not be considered for award selection. If any portion of the proposed effort is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the r! equirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the effort if the resource is not provided. (8) A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract. This section should specifically address any intellectual property claims associated with the outcome of this effort. (9) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel. (10) A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel and their qualifications, project/function/subcontractor relationships, technology transition plans, government interfaces, and planning, scheduling, and control practices. The cost portion shall include the one-page work breakdown structure, a cost summary, an! d a detailed breakdown of cost for the effort. The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  (1)	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to PMS403 programs are proposed, their feasibility, and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives. It is desirable that the developments be structured in phases to allow assessment and/or decision points, where allowable;  (2)	The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, the qualifications (including past performance) of the proposed principal investigator and other personnel, and the availability of appropriate facilities;  (3)	The degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to NAVSEA with rights compatible with NAVSEA research and development objectives; and (4)	The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) an update to instructions and the technical focus area for the submission of white papers in FY06 and FY07, (b) revised evaluation criteria, and (c) revision to the anticipated funding to be obligated each fiscal year. No other changes have been made. 

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. James R. Milligan, AFRL/IFSE, telephone: (315) 330-1491, email: James.Milligan@rl.af.mil. Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. 

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies originally intended to support the development of a Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) fuselet production environment. Due to a shift in fuselet research and development priorities, a new emphasis will be placed upon innovative technologies supporting net-centric information transformation in the large. This rather broadly scoped topic is further broken down into the following focus areas over the next two (2) fiscal years:

FY06: Information Assessment -- Assessment of and response to feedback on the value of information produced by information transformation services.

FY06: Workflow Orchestration -- Policy-driven orchestration of workflows for collections of asynchronous information transformation services.

FY07: Sensitivity Analysis -- Analysis and response to the sensitivity of information produced by information transformation functions.

FY 07: Autonomic Composition -- Autonomic composition/reconfiguration of information transformation logic based on enterprise goals and objectives.

FY07: Resource Management -- Managing the resources consumed by information transformation services.

Specifically for FY06, AFRL is soliciting white papers in the focus areas of information assessment and workflow orchestration, as described below. A more detailed description of the focus areas to be pursued in FY07 will be provided at a later date. White papers submitted for FY06 may address solutions specific to either information assessment or workflow orchestration, or a combination of both. Offerors may also submit multiple white papers in response to this solicitation.

(1) Information Assessment:
Assessing the relevance and value of a particular piece of information to the operational context of an information consumer is not easily done in an automated fashion. This solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for the assessment of and response to feedback on the value of information produced by information transformation services in satisfying customer needs. One technical challenge involves the development of methods and mechanisms (based on, for example, consumer roles and profiles, and information pedigree) that enable an approximate characterization of the value and relevance of managed information to the context of information consumers and the ability to react to potentially dynamic changes in context. Of interest are technologies for capturing, by way of specification, the needs of information consumers in the context of the roles they play. Also, technology for assessing the value and relevance of available information in light of the context revealed needs to be pursued in order to determine if an information transformation service needs to be discovered and invoked in order to satisfy an unmet information need. In addition, information transformation optimization in response to information consumer feedback is an important research aspect. In particular, based on the specification of the needs of information consumers, technologies are needed that provide feedback mechanisms so that the satisfaction of information consumer needs can be continually assessed for sustainable improvement in information transformation services.

(2) Workflow Orchestration:
Information transformation services such as fuselets may be implemented as web services or custom applications that serve as instruments for horizontal and vertical interoperability and cognitive growth. These services must function as a whole along with all other enterprise services to meet the policies, goals and objectives of the enterprise, and as such these will require workflow and business process management oversight as part of a net-centric enterprise mediation service orchestration component. This solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for policy-driven orchestration of efficient and cooperative workflows for collections of asynchronous information transformation services designed to satisfy the information sharing needs within and between a variety of domains and Communities of Interest (COIs).

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission. 

All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Rome Research Site/IFSE, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-08-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY06 and FY07 should be submitted by 1 Oct 2005 and 1 Oct 2006 respectively. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited. 

Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance:

<DESC>AFCEE has posted The PROACT Information Needs Assessment and The AFCEE IT Strategy Report referenced in this RFI at 

http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/business.asp  

All questions should be directed to JoAnn Hodges (210-536-4332) or by email:     Joann.hodges@brooks.af.mil



This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to support strategy development to increase effectiveness of the PROACT Environmental Information Clearinghouse service.  PROACT supports dissemination of information and knowledge that contributes to AFCEE's efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain leding-edge techniques. A specific objective of this RFI is to support creation of a virtual library on technical environmental resources that will be integrated into the fabric of HQ AFCEE. The environmental information exchange service should function as maps and Yellow Pages that point to knowledge but do not contain knowledge.  The virtual library concept is viewed as part of a core knowledge infrastructure supporting all programs, domains, and disciplines consistent with AFCEE’s roles and responsibilities including PROACT and the existing Air Force environmental training program, AFCEE/TDE Web University, hosted on the HQ AFCEE web site.  Additional objectives of this information support program are:  to communicate environmentally relevant Air Force guidance and policy; to facilitate development of technical guidance by discovery and delivery of relevant technical information that supports subject matter experts; to assist teams of professionals in conducting root-cause analysis; developing collaborative solutions to technical requirements, and quality evaluations.  Information received will be used for strategic planning functions that include: defining core infrastructure requirements; change and enhancement of the PROACT Information Clearinghouse program; change and enhancement of Web University; identification and deployment of measurement systems, program analysis, planning, and development; benchmarking and process migration.  The enhanced system must be responsive, accurate, flexible, and offer value-added products.

Requested information should consider both human and technical attributes for integration of data, documents, web sites, publications and subject matter experts.  The approach will address information/knowledge requirements identified in the PROACT Information needs assessment; the AFCEE IT Strategy Report as well as advances in knowledge management and lessons learned within the Portal, GCSS-AF, AF Knowledge Now, and the DoD’s Network Centric Enterprise Service (NCES) Architecture.   The resulting AFCEE strategy must support conduct of the organization’s mission.  The overarching objective of this RFI is to develop approaches to revise and update information and data systems to better identify the most appropriate contextual knowledge, not necessarily the most readily available, consistent with advances in the practice of knowledge management techniques.

Provide recommendations and conceptual approaches including but not limited to, techniques, software and hardware, as well as processes and procedures for developing an automated system for information management and process integration.  Consider:  management of data, information and knowledge contained in internal and external documents and databases; personnel resources of the Air Force and AFCEE, approaches to “mine” organizational data and information and/or knowledge sources in order to improve business practices.

PROACT

The Air Force (AF) PROACT Environmental Information Exchange service has been in operation since October 1992 and has answered over 25,000 technical inquiries from AF military and civilian personnel, with customers at every organizational level from installation personnel to the Secretary of Air Force (SAF).  The PROACT environmental information exchange helps Air Force personnel and current Air Force contractors meet pollution prevention goals and maintain environmental compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The PROACT information researcher currently provides answers to technical inquiries using databases; publications; library services; expert consultants from industry, AF, DoD, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), as well as state and local regulatory agencies as appropriate.  Tracking and documentation of customer data includes personal data and information from past inquiries, customer contacts, date of response to the customer, and time spent preparing response.  

Problem Definition: How do we create new capabilities consistent with Air Force Portal requirements to assist the end-to-end AFCEE business intelligence and analysis processes in addressing the Knowledge Discovery challenges while laying a foundation for the technologies of tomorrow?  This problem includes the following elements:

1. Massive, heterogeneous, unstructured, scattered, and unreliable data
2. Identification of complex, time-critical concepts
3. Capabilities for evolving user defined agents to assist in hypothesis investigation and “what-if” scenarios
The massive amounts of input data must be selected and presented in a way that drives the discovery and maximum use of the knowledge desired.  To do this, the volume of data must be reduced and filtered so that users are only provided with relevant data.  The approach must be sufficiently flexible to take advantage of current technology and allow phased upgrade of the initial capability to achieve interoperability with future advances.  Recommendations should include the evaluation of indigenous Air Force Portal Capabilities, off-the-shelf software, hardware and information/knowledge management techniques in order to optimize information and knowledge exchange.

Information products must communicate known guidance and policy, support Air Force Program Managers, comply with Department of Defense policy and guidance, and promote use of DoD sources and tools databases.   Information products and sources should be searchable using key words and concepts while remaining appropriately accessible for management evaluation.   The process must include metrics to identify and track customer-based priority targets that require special emphasis.  Information products should address key issues of importance such as recent rule-making activities, and regulatory updates or summarize technical responses to inquiries of general interest which are designed to reach the broadest range of Air Force callers and installations.  The information system should support development of solutions to previously unanswered problems including discovery of relevant, state-of-science information as well as identify subject matter experts.  The information developed and maintained in the system should be proactively diffused using multi-media cross feed products that are responsive to needs of the Air Force environmental community and promote corroboration in application of knowledge.  All products must be consistent with AFCEE policies and quality standards.
GOALS 
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, this RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for: 
 
1. Using state-of-the-art technology to develop enhanced information discovery along with environmental library resource management techniques that support the Environmental Information Clearing house program.
2. Suggested methods to collect, index (with a systematic numbering system) and file information from vendors and/or AF personnel concerning environmental technologies or products which could be implemented at military installations.  The expected result is the development of a content aggregation, organization, and discovery capability consistent with the policy, goals, and directives of the U. S. Air Force CIO concerning the Air Force Portal and methods for content management.
3. Methods for tracking usage of the information service, monitoring and assessing customer awareness of program services, effectiveness, customer satisfaction and identifying information needs.  Please include recommend approaches (such as advertising) or initiatives to maintain awareness and relevance of the service to Air Force stakeholders.
4. Approaches for database management, security access control, indexing, search, and geospatial software/standards, security certification and accreditation, along with any integration services necessary to complete system development.
5. Approaches to employ outside technical publications, services, subscriptions, licenses and other methods for streamlining access to technical and professional publications, guidance documents, as well as the policy, regulations and instructions which are essential for accomplishing the AFCEE mission.  Please incorporate recommendations with regard to design, modeling, selection, and implementation of technical information management systems necessary to advance the basic capabilities from both a hardware and software perspective.
6. Approaches to coordinate and leverage reporting of current events, communication, outreach and training related to topic areas such as:  Web University, Technology, Performance Based Management (PBM), Remedial System Optimization (RPO), Waste Management, Pollution Prevention, Sustainability, Natural Resources, and Cultural Resources.

WEB UNIVERSITY

The WebU system automates training delivery, stores, manages, and delivers information and tools, provides access to environmental information and resources, and serves as a portal to other environmental education and training resources and providers. WebU resides on two servers and operates in a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database environment, which allows users to interact with the Environmental Education and Training (EET) database through an interface consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and Active Server Pages.  WebU scripts allow users to enter, edit, and track environmental education and training data equal to the user’s level of permission and generate a variety of real-time reports.

The EET database consist of 20+ tables containing Air Force occupational series and job codes, performance-based tasks, regulatory mandates, unit equipment codes, training source information, course content, student and faculty information, and other data required to generate the Web University website.  The EET database functions as a Learning and Content Management System (LCMS or LMS) to deliver:  automated registration and authentication of student and faculty members; user ID and password management; management and delivery of course content; student activity tracking; test generation and scoring, and certificate management.  Reports generated by the database include web trends, user and course reports, the Area of Responsibility Checklist for overseas theaters, Air Force Environmental Task List, and the DoD Sources and Tools Catalog.  Authorized users are also able to upload documents such as meeting Minutes and briefings for long-term storage.

PROACT currently supports Web University through cross feed of requested Web University educational materials and collection of feedback forms and information.

Problem Definition: How do we integrate current and new capabilities to most effectively leverage resource to optimize information and training support; increase customer access, and streamline access, registration and other interactions?

GOALS
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, This RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for:
1. Using state of the art technology that will support distance learning.  
2. Managing student enrollment, delivery of training content, assessment of training effectiveness, curriculum development, course content management, and collaboration with external activities that provide relevant training.
3. Provide recommendations that will more fully integrate environmental information clearinghouse and environmental education and training activities.
4. Consolidating and integrating data contained in PRO-ACT and Air Force Environmental Education and Training databases to minimize duplication of effort, share resources, and provide on-line access to information and resources through the appropriate forum (i.e. PRO-ACT, WebU Library, etc.).  Consideration should be given to identifying and including information in the DoD Sources and Tools Database, referencing in WebU courses, and featuring in the WebU Spotlight to alert users to noteworthy events, news, and information.
5. Approaches for supporting WebU students and users.  Areas of consideration should include, but not be limited to, WebU Help Desk; recommended initial point of contact for content related questions; maintaining course links and references; monitoring and updating regulatory references contained in the Environmental Master Task List and Area of Responsibility Checklists, and identifying obsolete and additional tasks.
6. Approaches for developing and maintaining Environmental Facts Sheets or information summaries.  For example, a subject-specific Facts Sheet prepared as single or double sided information sheets with charts, graphs, and brief statements related to a specific topic or program.  Provide recommendation for approaches to select topics warranting information summary development; determining the appropriate number of summaries, and process to efficiently maintain current accurate content for all AFCEE program areas.

<DESC>This synopsis is a modification to the original synopsis.  The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry that there has been a change to the requirements in the subject solicitation.  Through this solicitation the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from offerors interested in entering into a Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) to support the worldwide demand for knee and hip prosthetics products that fall into the following groups:  Groups One through Four contain knee and hip prosthetic implants (either procedural and/or component pricing); Group Five contains instrumentation sets that will be used by the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) during implantation of the knee and hip prosthetic and returned to the contractor; and, Group Six contains auxiliary products needed for implantation of a knee and hip prosthetic.  Offers may be submitted on Group One through Group Six individually or collectively, except, any offer of procedural pricing must also offer component pricing of implants.   This solicitation contains an on-site personnel requirement that is applicable to offerors who submit a proposal that includes implant and/or instrumentation sets.  The contractor will be required to provide technical advice and guidance to physicians before, during and after implantation of the prosthetic at the request of the MTFs.  Technical support shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  

This solicitation contains three delivery methods depending on the group(s) of products offered.  The three delivery methods are: Consignment, Just-in-Time and Direct Delivery.  Offerors who submit an offer that includes implants detailed in Group One through Four must be able to deliver “Just-In-Time” and “Direct Delivery”.  Offerors that submit an offer that includes auxiliary products and/or instrumentation sets detailed in Group five and Group six must deliver products “Just-In-Time” and/or “Direct Delivery”.  The choice of “Consignment Agreement” as a delivery method is optional.  However, “Consignment Agreement” will only be considered as a delivery method for auxiliary products and instrumentation sets if the offeror is offering implants on consignment.   
  After award of any contracts resulting from this solicitation, each MTF that will be ordering will inform the contractor if they intend to use “Consignment Agreement”.  Consignment as a delivery method will be limited to those MTF that perform implant surgeries in such a number that they can turn their inventory  2.5 inventory turns a year.    All catalog prices submitted should be FOB Destination.  

 Contractors will be required to submit catalog(s).  It is encouraged that the catalog(s) submitted in response to this solicitation contain the offeror’s entire knee and hip product line that fall within the groups identified above.  All applicable products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.  DSCP intends to make awards to offerors who comply with the requirements of the solicitation.  This solicitation covers DSCP ECAT customers worldwide.   Offerors should submit Continental United States (CONUS) catalogs, which include all facilities, located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  These CONUS sites will be implemented first.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States as defined above and will be solicited at a future date under this solicitation number.  Due to transportation costs, potential customer problems, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restrictions and/or limitations, a separately priced OCONUS catalog will therefore not be required with your initial submission under this solicitation.  For both CONUS and OCONUS catalogs, all facilities must be serviced.  After award, each contractor’s product line will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  Physicians from the ordering facilities will make a  “Best Value” decision when selecting products.  

All transactions sets under any resultant contracts are required to be electronic.  Each contractor will be required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are (3) three communication options available for ECAT: Web Supplier Interface, Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) and American National Standard Institute (ANSI) x 12 EDI Standards. Offerors must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  Offerors will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation. 

 Closing dates and time for receipt of proposals are hereby amended.  This solicitation allows for two open seasons: the first open season will commence on June 7, 2005 and close September 7, 2005 at 3:00 P.M./EST.  The second open season will commence December 7, 2005 and close March 7, 2006 at 3:00 P.M./EST.  Proposals received during the open season will not be evaluated before the solicitation has closed. Offerors are requested to submit complete proposals for all requirements, as specified in the solicitation. Any resultant contracts will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $20 million dollars over the total contract period for all contracts combined.  The Solicitation and all amendments can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home/

<DESC>On behalf of the Program Manager-Mobile Electric Power, the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communication, Command and Control Directorate (C2D), Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA is perfor ming a market survey of commercial and military power distribution equipment. The CERDEC Power Generation Branch is searching for a new family of power distribution equipment capable of transmitting electrical power between military power generating source s (see www.pmmep.org/ for specifications) and power consuming equipment. The desired power distribution equipment must distribute power from central power sources (rated at 10kW-200kW, 120/208VAC and/or 240/416VAC, single and three phase systems), be man-p ortable, provide flexibility to unit operations, and be quickly assembled and disassembled for rapid relocation. In addition, the power distribution equipment must operate at various altitudes and in climatic conditions of 40 degrees Fahrenheit to +140 de grees Fahrenheit, rain, humidity, salt spray, and fungus.  The power distribution equipment must be compatible with International Standardization Organization (ISO) containers, Standardized Integrated Command Post (SICPs) System Rigid Wall Shelters, and Te nt Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER).  In particular, the new power distribution equipment must be capable of the functionality contained within the current Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) of the Army (specifications can be  found at https://www.logsa.army.mil/etms/data/A/069909.pdf) at a minimum.  Some additional features desired are automatic load balancing between phases, paralleling capability, no-break load transferring between generators and data logging of power charac teristics.  Weight and footprint should not exceed that of the current PDISE system.  CERDEC is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the experience of each contractor in design, development, and fabrication and  testing of their power distribution systems, detailed specifications of their power distribution systems, organizational capabilities, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for potential future government procurements. The data received in respon se to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements.  There is no funding available to procure materials that meet the above requirements at this time.   It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to  the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. In addition, the Government does not plan to pay for any information received from this request for information (RFI).  If so, clearly mark such pro prietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  All responses to this market research shall be submitted no later than close of business on 17 October 2005.  Responses must be submitted via electronic mail to  Ms. Michelle N. Gaffney, Project Engineer at michelle.gaffney@armypower.army.mil. All questions of a technical nature should be directed to Ms. Gaffney at the above email address.  All questions of a contractual nature shall be address to Ms. Patricia Dav is, Contracting Officer at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil.  No telephonic inquiries or requests will be honored.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			USAID/Armenia/DSRO	  				
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.  BACKGROUND

Due to the immediate and dramatic needs of Armenia following its declaration of independence in 1991, USAID’s interventions in the social and health sectors focused initially on the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance.  Throughout the Mission’s 1999-2003 strategy, USAID/Armenia refocused its humanitarian assistance programs towards longer-term development efforts in the social and health areas.
Under the new country strategy (FY2004-2008), USAID/Armenia’s Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) oversees work of three Strategic Objectives (SOs):  democracy/governance (SO 2.1), health (SO 3.2), and social protection (SO 3.4).  The “improved social protection” strategic objective will be achieved through three intermediate results (IRs):  improved social assistance services for targeted populations, reduced need for government subsidies, and established operationally viable social insurance systems.
The new strategy does not represent an abrupt break with past activities, but rather a forward-looking, results-oriented and longer-term development focus that is based on solid evidence of past results, lessons learned, evolving needs and new technologies.  For health and social protection activities, there has been a smooth transition as the Mission’s new strategy went into effect in October 2003.  Many of the previously-established activities are being continued, others have been refined and modified, and those which have reached their goals were closed out. 
The Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, the primary host government ministry with which the Advisor is expected to interact, is like most Government of Armenia (GOAM) entities, weak institutionally, resource poor, and suffers from severely inadequate budget levels.  This grim reality underscores the need for social sector reforms leading to the development of sustainable systems for social insurance, welfare and pensions for the most vulnerable populations within this country, where an estimated 55 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.

II.	Duties and Responsibilities

The Social Sector Advisor will serve as the Team Leader for the SO 3.4 team.
The incumbent will advise on general responsibilities to meet USAID’s strategic goals, provide policy guidance, and review work in terms of overall accomplishment of desired results.  The Advisor is expected to function as a senior professional, and carry out his/her work with minimal supervision, providing technical guidance to FSN staff, other contractors, partners and customers in the development, implementation and monitoring/evaluation of program activities.

The Social Sector Advisor will be expected to draw upon experiences from a wide range of disciplines in performing his/her duties.  New activities in the social sector area are expected to be fully integrated with other strategic priorities in the Mission’s portfolio, including economic development, short-term employment generation, civil service reform, alternative service provision, and local government/non-governmental organization development.
 
The Advisor will be required to provide accurate and informed advice to the Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of social sector issues with particular emphasis on policy reform.  She/He will provide leadership in the technical and policy reform area to Mission Management, Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, partners, counterparts and customers.  The counterparts and customers will look to the Advisor to present viable and pertinent options to social sector issues.
   
The incumbent has the following duties and responsibilities:
 
•	The Advisor will provide substantive technical and advocacy leadership for USAID/Armenia’s social transition program.  This will include, but not be limited to: 1) identifying achievable development results in collaboration with USAID customers; 2) establishing dialogue with and obtaining/maintaining support from partners, customers and stakeholders; 3) obtaining Washington agreement on development results and related financing; and 4) obtaining Mission level approvals for initiating development activities.

•	The Advisor will facilitate achievement of social transition program goals to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.  This includes the planning, management, reporting and budgeting responsibilities for SO 3.4 activities. 

•	The Social Sector Advisor will be responsible for ensuring the acceptable performance and completion of contract scopes-of-work (SOWs) for technical assistance and commodity procurement, terms of reference (TORs), work plans, delivery orders, budget tasks, and specifications by the short and long-term technical advisors as well as institutional contractors.  He/she will make periodic project site visits and write reports with observations and recommendations.

•	The Advisor will meet with host country officials and customers to determine needs for assistance in the sector, as well as meet periodically with other donors to report and coordinate programs and activities.  The Advisor will be responsible for identifying opportunities for USAID/Armenia to leverage other donor resources in support of USAID/Armenia’s social sector reform agenda.

•	She/he will assist in the development of a program of training and exchanges for social sector policy makers and professionals in Armenia.

•	The Advisor will be responsible for the recruitment, training and career development of competent social sector development FSN professionals, as required.

•	Other job-related duties as assigned.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase 6- CR2 Under Water Acoustic receivers for detecting VEMCO 69KHz R256, R4K and S256 coded transmitters in sturgeon.  VR2 MAP 1431 includes TADIRAN D-cell lithium battery.  This item is being purchased for the National Marine Fisheries Service, Panama City FL.  The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one company under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The company is VEMCO Drafting Products of San Dimas CA.  VEMCO manufactured the transmitters that are being tracked.  Although there is one company who may make acoustic receiver similar to the VR2, the model has not been successfully field tested.  For this requirement, there is not sufficient time to field test another product sufficiently to determine if the receiver can pick up the VEMCO transmitters that were previously attached to sturgeon.  The use of any other vendor’s receiver would necessitate extensive test and evaluation that would cause the government to incur delays and costs that could not be recovered through competition.  The government believes it is in their best interest to acquire these receivers from VEMCO.  Any proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide an acoustic receiver that has been fully and successfully tested with VEMCO transmitters.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified product.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

There is a pressing need to support democratization and to increase its credibility in Yemen.  Democratic governance is essential to both the economic growth that Yemen desperately needs and to managing the conflicts that threaten to destabilize its internal equilibrium.  It is therefore imperative for the USG to prioritize activities to encourage Yemen’s movement towards increased democracy and governance by strengthening representative institutions and the capacity and roles of their reform-minded members, and supporting more representative participation and a more representative environment.

The Democracy and Governance Special Objective (DG SpO8) “Expanded Democracy and Governance in Yemen,” amends the USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy (May 5, 2003 - September 30, 2006) that was approved on May 5, 2003.  The DG SpO8 includes two Intermediate Results:  IR 1.0, “Representative Institutions Strengthened,” and, IR 2.0, “Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported.” 

IR 1.0, “Representative Institutions Strengthened,” corresponds to USAID/Yemen’s core DG activities that will address key development challenges in the DG sector and that directly support other elements of the USAID development program in Yemen.  Activities under IR 1.0 will focus on the roles, capacity, processes and interrelationships among members of parliament, local councils, line ministries and community organizations and will include the allocation and oversight of funds in the national and local fiscal process.

IR 2.0, “Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported,” provides a mechanism for USAID/Yemen, if requested, to address targets of opportunity jointly agreed to by Embassy/Sana’a and USAID/Yemen that are funded by bilateral ESF allocations to USAID/Yemen, and are cleared by the USAID Bureau for Asia and the Near East (ANE). 

The DG SpO8 will maintain the cross-cutting theme of special attention to the needs and empowerment of women that is a key objective throughout the USAID Interim Strategy for Yemen.

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI:  Department of Homeland Security, Enterprise e-Recruitment Solution
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DHS-05-RFI-ERECRUIT
<RESPDATE>092605
<ARCHDATE>10112005
<CONTACT>Curtis Courtney, Contract Specialist, Phone 202 283-2897, Fax -6907, Email curtis.a.courtney@irs.gov - Carol Bacon, Contract Administrator, Phone (202) 283-1288, Fax (202) 283-1099, Email Carol.Bacon@irs.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No solicitation is available.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a potential requirement for an enterprise recruitment/hiring solution that can consolidate and modernize its current hiring systems, seamlessly integrate with other non-DHS services (e.g., OPM¡¦s USAJobs and NFC¡¦s EmpowHR personnel system), and provide sufficient functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of all component organizations.  DHS will consider using systems based on commercial or government off-the-shelf software but will not adopt any solution that involves a traditional software development effort.  The DHS employee population is approximately 160,000 persons; application inflow to DHS exceeds 2 million resumes/applications annually.  In 2004, DHS filled over 28,000 positions.  Key high level goals for this system are:  Automate the processes used to manage the full recruitment/hiring lifecycle; create a single portal for all job applicants; reduce manual processes and/or eliminate paper-based systems; provide an easy-to-use interface for all system users (hiring managers, HR and EEO professionals; and applicantsƒ{internal and external); implement industry best practices; and reduce hiring/recruitment costs.  The four hyperlinks provided below are intended to provide prospective vendors with insights into related federal initiatives and guidance.

DHS is engaged in preliminary market research and is currently consolidating/refining requirements from its individual components for an enterprise e-Recruitment solution.  Accordingly, the purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from the vendor community about products and services in the marketplace which are capable of meeting DHS¡¦ needs.  DHS will consider a multi-system, multiple vendor (company teaming arrangements) approach, if technically feasible and advantageous.

Vendors should describe the capabilities of their solutions with respect to the following five major facets of the hiring/recruitment cycle:  (1) Workforce Planning (demand planning, supply planning); (2) Requisitioning (job descriptions, approval workflow, job posting); (3) Candidate Talent Searching (candidate marketing, passive and active candidate sourcing including but not limited to job fairs, referrals, resume mining, outreach, unsolicited applications); (4) Candidate Acquisition (referral management, candidate application, candidate screening/assessment, candidate scoring/search); (5) Applicant Tracking (applicant workflow, communications/correspondence management, interview management, personnel security background checks/drug screening, ¡§on-boarding¡¨); and (6) Reporting/Analytics (regulatory reporting, ad hoc reporting, standard reporting/analytics, advanced analytics).  Solutions must be capable of processing a high volume of applications, provide bi-directional interfaces with numerous Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS) systems, be compatible with back end databases such as Oracle, provide integrated e-mail and calendar services, send electronic notifications to applicants, DHS HR staff and hiring managers, possess robust workflow capabilities, provide a candidate portal that allows applicants to monitor the status of their applications, and provide dashboard type functionality for tracking metrics on recruitment activities across DHS departments.  Vendor support services should include system administration services that are available for the solution, and system hosting arrangement provided by the vendor.

Vendors meeting the above requirements shall submit a written statement of capabilities not to exceed fifteen (15) pages. In addition to a description of the capabilities of the proposed solution,  vendors should address in their response what knowledge or experience they have with governmental (federal/state/local) HR systems.  Vendors should also state what flexibility/scalability their solutions offer in order to adapt to changing recruitment needs in DHS.  Vendors should describe how their solutions function from a technical perspective and identify any hosting services or application service provider (ASP) arrangements that are offered to support the solution.

Additionally, DHS requests that vendors provide rough-order-of-magnitude pricing (e.g., including software licenses, consulting rates, hosting fees) for their solutions, given their understanding of the limited number of requirements stated in this RFI.  Also, vendors should indicate if their products/services are available through any existing government contract vehicles (e.g,, GSA schedule, GWACS).

DHS requests that vendors submit their information in response to this RFI by the response date listed above. 
Vendors responding to this RFI should provide:  (1) name and address of the firm; (2) size of the business; (3) years in business; (4) description of the client base; (5) type of ownership (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, hub-zone, and/or disabled veteran). 
If time permits, and depending on the volume of responses, individual vendors MAY be contacted for a product demo prior to release of a solicitation.    The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the demonstration of any software products or any written response to this notice under this request for information announcement.  

This is a sources sought notice only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from  a review of the information provided; however, DHS may utilize the information gathered for technical and acquisition purposes. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by respondents.  All responses to this notice are to be submitted via e-mail in Microsoft Office format to: curtis.a.courtney@irs.gov. 

Any demonstration CDs, discs, screen shots, or web links submitted by the vendor must be capable of being run/displayed on a PC with Windows 2000 or XP, and include operator instructions.  Additional or supplemental hard copy materials may also be submitted to: Office of  Procurement, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD 20745, ATTN: Curtis Courtney. All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media shall be free of any computer virus. If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed and a replacement provided within 3 days after notification. All data designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.  http://www.opm.gov/egov/EHRI_overview.asp; http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf;

Q:  Approximately how many hard copy documents do you have and in what format would you like to convert?  I.E. MS Word, HTML, PDF etc.  A:  Current documents are stored in file cabinets with the following dimensions:   98  14 x 12 file drawers     35  27 x 12 file drawers     25  25 x 12 file drawers    7  15 x 28 file drawers    5  27 x 12       These documents would all need to be converted to a format that is compatible with MS Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.  The objectives are: (1) to consolidate for later retrieval and use all documents (electronic and hard copy) generated by or reviewed by the L egal Office; (2) maintain the integrity of the original document for historical purposes (e.g., case files, precedential legal opinions, and final decision documents); (3) to allow cut and paste ability for incorporation into subsequent documents (e.g., legal briefs and advisory memoranda); and (4) to allow destruction of hard copy documents (and therefore free up office space) for all but the most critical matters (active original case files, original client documents that must be maintained). If (2) and (3) cannot be reconciled, a PDF-type solution is acceptable for critical documents (final decision documents with original signature, litigation case files), but working documents (drafts, routine memoranda) would need to be in MS compatible for mat (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) for later editing and re-use. NOTE: Similar information/documentation also exists in electronic format on a dedicated network server, individual PC hard drives, and in individual Outlook email folders maintained by each user. Q:  Do you have any detail requirements for compliance with a Government Legal Office?  A:  There are no unique requirements for the file formats for the Legal Office.  The material maintained within the office is restricted from release by virtue of attorney-client privilege; attorney work product privilege; competition-sensitive and procure ment-sensitive material; Privacy Act; predecisional material under the Freedom of Information Act.  Accordingly, any electronic storage and retrieval system must prevent unauthorized access to Legal Office material. Q:  Does ANAD currently deploy a legacy electronic system for document management that has a database warehouse or is the current document management process a purely manual file library? A:  Documents are maintained in manual files.  Electronic documents in various formats (PDF, HTML, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, MS Excel) are maintained on a dedicated server and in MS Outlook email system. Q:  What are the future plans for the proposed solution, stand alone in legal office, web based access via depot intranet, integrated with document control registers in LMP/SAP? A:  Stand alone in the legal office. Q:  How many users are expected to have access authorization (Legal off ice personnel only or ANAD depot wide)?  Nine (9), Legal Office personnel only. Q:  Is system intended for only ANAD personnel (internal users) or will remote access (external users) to the data in the legal office Electronic Technical Library (ETL) ever be required to support ANAD dispatched field repair/evaluation teams. A:  Internal users only. Q:  Could you briefly describe the type of documentation intended to be kept in the automated file system? (example: Business supporting documentation - invoices, bills, receipt/shipping documentation, Engineering documentation - Procedures, Prints and Tec h Manuals or Maintenance Shop Floor documentation - Work tickets, data sheets, procedures) A:  Legal opinion files consisting of standard memoranda and backup material; litigation case files consisting of original-signature documents, documentary exhibits, briefs, administrative paperwork, and adjudicator decision documents; claim files consisti ng of standard government forms, claimant-submitted invoices, estimates, and supporting documentation; and transmittal and decision memoranda; internal office files consisting of government forms, memoranda, receipts and vouchers.  This documentation curre ntly exists in hard copy format as well as in electronic format on a dedicated server and individual PC hard drives and in individual Outlook email folders maintained by each user. Q:  Are you interested in a solution where contractor would provide the labor and hardware and software and do it on site or would you like to send the work off site to have it scanned or converted. A:  Contractor would be required to provide labor for initial scanning of documents, any associated hardware outside of normal PC workstation, and subsequent training of government personnel for future use.  Work would be performed on site.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Restoration of Historic Cloud Cap Inn - Mt Hood
<DESC>Pre Proposal Meeting - Cloud Cap Inn East Wing Restoration Phase One - All interested parties are invited to attend one of two mandatory Preproposal Meetings (site visits) scheduled to share information about work that is to occur on the historic Cloud Cap Inn. The dates and time for the Site Visit are - September 22, 2005, and October 5, 2005; 10:00 AM at the junction of Cooper Spur Road and Forest Road 3512.  Meet in the Cooper Spur Inn parking lot, then travel to the project site.  Approximate return to Cooper Spur Inn will be 2:00 P.M.  Please note that no food is available at the site.  Because the area receives significant amounts of snow, the intent of the site visits is to share information while the site is still snow-free.  The actual solicitation for the restoration will be issued during the winter months.  Construction season at the site is typically July 4 to October 1.  The Inn is located at the 6,000’ elevation on the north side of Mt Hood, Mt Hood National Forest, Hood River Ranger District at the end of Forest Road 3512, approximately 45 minutes south of Hood River, Oregon.  The overall objective of the East Wing Restoration Project is to return that portion of the structure to as close to the original 1889 design as possible. The focus of phase one of the east wing restoration is to restore the east side pavilion on the north side of the main hall and to restore the south wall of the east wing.  All work will need to conform to the historic restoration-reconstruction guidelines for buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places as specified in the contract. Work will include, but is not limited to demolition of existing foundation, excavation of crawlspace, construction of new foundation and piers, partial demolition of the existing walls, erection of new walls with Government-furnished logs, placement of new windows provided by contractor, partial removal and replacement of T&G flooring and ceiling where needed with lumber provided by the Government. Preliminary design information will be shared at the Site Visit.  This is a mandatory site visit.  Offerors that have not attended one of the site visits will not be eligible for award.  Offers will be evaluated using the best value source selection process.  Experience in historic log restoration projects will be an evaluation factor.  Interested parties shall notify the Contracting Officer, Lois Tate, via e-mail at ltate@fs.fed.us of their intent to attend a preproposal meeting.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WITH REQUIRED QUANTITIES:  Color Multifunctional Displays and Data Entry Displays BACKGROUND The Human Engineering Development System (HEDS) is part of the Software Maintenance Group (309SMXG) located at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Among other responsibilities, SMXG supports all Operational Flight Program (OFP) modifications to the F-16 C/D Block 30 aircraft. HEDS is responsible for prototyping some OFP changes and then showing these prototypes in a flight simulator to pilots and others who make decisions about the OFP upgrades. OBJECTIVE Prototyping and simulating an OFP modification is most effective when experienced in an environment simulating actual flight conditions.  Upcoming OFP upgrades include changing the Multi-Functional Displays (MFDs) from monochrome to color, which will allow for more assessable information to be displayed to the pilot.  Another display that is used for retrieving information is the Data Entry Display (DED).  These displays are required to present prototyping of OFP modifications.  The required displays are described below. 1.1.	MFD Specifications.  The MFD must have the following characteristics: 1.1.1.	Must fit within a 5.25w by 5.25h by 12l inch space. 1.1.2.

(End of provision) 52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) (a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each Offeror's submission is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A, B, and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is less important.    A)	Compliance with solicitation requirement (Specifications for MFD's and DED's) B)	Product Availability  C)	Delivery Schedule  D)	Price Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offers that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. 	(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 	(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Evaluation and Planning Team (EPT) is part of the Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  The EPT is charged with improving the effectiveness of OFDA programming by strengthening OFDA's capacity to plan, monitor, and evaluate.

Introduction

The OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The DRM Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.

This acquisition is for Brand Name items only and is a small business set-aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,00) will be followed.  The contractor shall provide the following items to the 412th Test Wing Electronic Warfare Division based on the information stated:  Double-Ridged Waveguide Horn (Antennas), Model 3117 (Quantity - 6).  The frequency range is 1 GHz – 18 GHz.  The primary reason for the purchase is maintaining a single lobe radiation pattern over the entire operational frequency range.  Manufacturer is ETS-Lindgren.

Brand Name Justification Information:

1. The Electronic Warfare (EW) Directorate requests the brand name purchase of a Double Ridge Wave Guide Horn (Antenna), Model 3117.  This antenna provides the most up-to-date technology for microwave and EMC measurement.  EW Directorate testing will benefit from the uniform illumination of target surfaces and accurate gain measurement.  

2. The Double Ridge Wave Guide Horn (Antenna), Model 3117 is a recently designed antenna and will be a direct replacement part for the existing ETS/EMCO 3115 antenna currently in use.  The 3117 Horn (antenna) represents significant advances in performance over the 3115 as detailed below. The salient functional characteristics that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Directorate are: 

·Maintains single lobe radiation pattern
·Even distribution of electromagnetic energy on target over entire frequency range
·Higher structural integrity, maintains a more constant antenna gain/pattern throughout calibration cycle and lifetime of the antenna
·Ultra Broadband: 1GHz – 18 GHz
·Power Input 300 W Power Input Capacity
·Uniform Gain, Low VSWR
·More accurate gain and vector measurements
·Elimination of high gain side-lobes helps reduce multipath effect from degrading measurement accuracy

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

INFORMATION ON
EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS MATERIAL 

As required by 29 CFR 1910.1200, The Hazard Communications Standard, the shipyard must inform you (as a contractor employer with employees working in the shipyard) of the hazardous materials used at the Shipyard which your employees may be exposed to while working here and also to suggest appropriate protective measures.  This section informs you as required.  Your own responsibilities as an employer, if any, are given in 29 CFR 1910.1200

1.   Hazardous materials your employees may be exposed to.  Hazardous materials are materials which are cancer causing agents, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, liver toxins, kidney toxins, agents which act on the blood forming system, and agents which damage the lungs, skins, eyes or mucous membranes.  There are many potentially hazardous chemicals present at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which, unless controlled properly, could present a safety and health problem.  The presence of many potentially hazardous materials ranges in type ad quantity.  Typical hazardous materials are:  

a.	Metals, e.g., mercury, lead, chromium

b.	Solvents, e.g., disinfectants, cleaning and polishing compounds and preparations, dopes, thinners, flammable inks

c.	Paints and adhesives, e.g., varnishes and related products, sealing compounds, asphalt, deck and floor coverings, deck compounds

d.	Corrosives, e.g., acids, alkalis

e.	Compressed and liquefied gas, e.g., nitrogen, argon, oxygen, acetylene

f.	Lubricants and oils, e.g., greases, cutting oils, hydraulic oils, miscellaneous waxes and fats.

g.	Fuels, e.g., liquid propellants, fuel oils, oxidizers, solid fuels

h.	Particulates, e.g., asbestos fiberglass, dust, fumes, mist

Depending on the material involved, materials such as these can present physical hazards and./or health hazards.  The presence of many potential hazardous materials may be apparent due to their physical characteristics, such as the visual appearance of abrasive blasting dust or the distinctive smell of many solvents.

2.  Labeling of Hazardous Material.  Containers of potentially hazardous chemicals bear manufacturer’s labeling, which identifies the chemical and its manufacturer, and provides appropriate hazard warnings.  In addition, some materials may be labeled with the National Protection Association (NFPA) 704 label.  This label uses a system of color coded symbols and numbers to convey the potential hazard of the material.  The contract should obtain information from NFPA concerning the interpretation of the 704 label.

3.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  The Occupational Safety and Health Office at the shipyard maintains copies of manufacturers’ Material Safety Data sheets for potentially hazardous chemicals/materials that are known to be present in the shipyard.  The contractor may, upon request to the Occupational Safety and Health Office, review Material Safety Data Sheets for any specific materials to which contractor employees may be exposed while performing work in the shipyard workplace.  This information may be reviewed in the Occupational Safety and Health Office.

4.  Appropriate Protective Measures.  Exposure to potentially hazardous material may occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin contact with the material:  therefore, the following precautions should be taken:

a.	Obey signs, directions and warning labels;

b.	Do not use unknown or labeled materials;

c.	Only operate shipyard equipment that you are authorized to operate, familiar with, and qualified to operate;

d.	If any health effects (skin rash, trouble breathing, etc.) occur, which you feel are caused by exposure to shipyard hazardous material, contact Code 106.1

For specific information on any hazardous material contact Code 106.1, Building 22, phone (207) 438-2001, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, NH  03801-5000.

<DESC>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Artesia, NM intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed contract for the following:  Provide all labor, materials, equipment and supervision necessary to perform the work to meet Department of Homeland Security (DHS) standards for removing and re-striping vehicles.  The government will furnish the new striping material to include the door seals.  Removal of Striping:  The contractor shall remove existing striping without damaging, scratching or altering the existing vehicle paint.  In addition to removal of existing striping, the contractor shall be responsible to remove all adhesive and residue left by the striping material.  The contractor shall use the appropriate method to clean and blend the surfaces of the vehicle so that the paint at the previously striped area blends in with the paint on the rest of the vehicle.  The contractor shall apply clear coat wax/protectorant to vehicles not being re-striped.  Re-striping:  The contractor shall use appropriate materials to clean and remove all wax, protectorant, residue and any foreign substances from areas of vehicles to be striped.  The government will provide striping material as per DHS guidelines and pattern for applying striping material.  The government will provide the fleet numbers for each vehicle.  After the striping has been securely fixed, the contractor will apply finish products (wax/polish/ protectorant) to each vehicle.  Detailing of vehicles: The contractor shall perform the following services in accordance with industry standards: wash the exterior of the vehicle to remove grease, grime, dirt, tar, bugs and all foreign substances. Use appropriate cleaners that will damage neither painting nor striping on all areas of the vehicle and its components (e.g. plastic lens covers on the overhead light bars) to include but not limited to tires, bumpers and grills.  Apply finish products (wax/polish/protectorant) to clean vehicles.  Wax/Polish applications will be buffed either by hand or machine to bring out the shine.  The exterior finish to include windows will be free from spots.  The contractor shall vacuum the interior of the vehicle to include floor, floor mats and seats.  The contractor shall use appropriate cleansers and materials to remove existing stains in the aforementioned floor, floor mats and seats.  The contractor shall apply appropriate cleaners and protectorants to all vinyl type surfaces.  The final product for steering wheel and seats are to be clean and shiny, but free from being slick and slippery.  Detailing:  The government will deliver up to ten vehicles per week to be completed by the contractor within three days after delivery.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to notify the government’s POC if all vehicles cannot not be picked-up by the government as per the stated timeframe.  If the contractor fails to notify the government and/or fails to detail all delivered vehicles timely, the contractor will be assessed damages due to failure to perform as per the specification requirements.  The government’s radius for delivery is within fifteen miles or less from the post of duty (1300 W. Richey or West Range Compound).  The government will deliver no more than five vehicles on any given day for either striping or detailing.  The turn around time for vehicles having the striping removed shall be completed within three days after delivery and picked up by the government on the third day.   Vehicle being re-striped shall be inspected by the government POC once the old striping has been removed and before applying new striping to make sure no discoloration will appear once the final work is performed.  This inspection will take place at the contractor’s location. For vehicles that have discoloration or blemishes that will show once the old striping has been removed and will not be covered by the new striping scheme, the government POC will be notified accordingly.  For additional cost to be incurred within scope of this requirement, the government and the contractor may negotiate via modification for changes.   In the event that a reasonable solution is not available, the government will procure the services by other means to perform this new work. Upon completion of work by other means, if necessary, the government will return the vehicle to the contractor for application of the new striping process.   The returned vehicle shall be inspected by the government prior to the contractor applying the new striping as the final work.  The contractor shall complete all work within three days after approval by the government.  Pictures will be provided upon request to show what the final product should be.

*********************************************************************************************************************
The Air Force is seeking the procurement of programmable microarray slides to support their efforts to develop and validate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology capable of rapid, genetic identification of multiple viruses and/or bacteria simultaneously that can cause upper respiratory and wound infections.  Microarrays shall be in a 1”x 3” durable format that can be used with standard, commercially available labeling material and kits for a wide variety of genomic assays.  Microarrays shall be able to support both fluorescence and electrochemical based methodologies.  Microarray processing shall not require contractor specific support equipment, such as a hybridization oven or microarray reader for fluorescence detection.  Rather, it shall be compatible with COTS available equipment used for industry standard microarray processing and analysis.  The microarray must allow for fluorescent-based and microelectrochemical-based detection of viruses and bacteria.  Microarray format shall be such that specific hybridization events can be detected using industry standard equipment that can be configured into a small, rugged footprint.

To support development of microarray content for specific upper respiratory and wound infections, the microarray shall support the display of at least 12,000 different genetic sequences (probes) for agent identification.  These probes shall be synthesized directly on the microarray and be totally customizable, i.e., probe sequence and length (up to 50 bases long) shall be user defined and capable of being modified rapidly.  Costs for bioinformatics support, microarray imaging software, and microarray design shall be included in the cost of each microarray.  There shall be no additional charges or fees for microarray set up or change.  There shall be no minimum order for a particular microarray design, and a new design shall be available for shipment to the Air Force within 3 weeks following a request.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6-streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The Solicitation number is SB1341-05-Q-0993.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.

THE TWO (2) CONTRACT LINE ITEMS FOR THIS RFQ, AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM, ARE AS FOLLOWS:

ITEM NO. 0001, SYSTEM THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS ALL MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS BELOW; QUANTITY: 1; UNIT: EACH.

MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS FOR ITEM NO. 0001: 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland required an optical frequency comb system to be used for optical frequency metrology, providing a comb of optical frequencies at multiples of the frequency of a radio frequency (RF) reference (at nominally 10 MHz).  Note: the RF reference source is not part of this procurement, but all other components necessary to generate a stabilized comb of optical frequencies are required.  

1. The comb system shall be capable of providing optical frequencies, at integer multiples of the reference frequency, with uncertainties at the 10 to the minus 12 level or better for averaging times in excess of 1 second (s).  (This assumes that NIST provides a correspondingly stable and accurate 10 Megahertz (MHz) RF reference.).

2. The system shall include a mode locked femtosecond (fs) laser along with all optical, optoelectronic, and electronic components needed for stabilization of the carrier offset frequency and stabilization of the repetition rate.  

3. The basic femtosecond laser, along with an included pulse compressor, should be capable of providing pulses with less than 100 fs width at an average power in excess of 160 milliwatt (mW). 

4. The carrier envelope offset (CEO) frequency will be stabilized via a self-referencing technique, in conjunction with generation of an octave-spanning output, a frequency to twice the frequency (f to 2f) interferometer, and a servo system to control the CEO frequency. 

5. The repetition rate of the laser (hence the spacing between individual frequencies of the output comb) shall exceed 90 MHz. 

6. Mechanisms shall be provided for adjustment of the length of the laser cavity, so that the repetition rate may be changed by at least 0.2 MHz.  It shall be possible to change the length of the reference cavity, make a corresponding change in the RF reference frequency, and re-establish locked operation (of the repetition rate and the CEO) without the need for additional adjustments of the system (such as realignment).   

7. The system shall be capable of providing a source for frequency metrology in both the visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum:  

7a. The octave-broadened output of the laser shall cover a range of 1000 nm to 2000 nm. (The exact values are not important: the two end points may differ from these values by as much as 15 %.)

7b: Second-harmonic generation shall be included to provide a frequency-doubled output in the visible, giving an output that can be adjusted over the spectral range from 530 nm to 700 nm. Within this spectral range, the second-harmonic output shall be capable of providing a power exceeding 30 nanowatt (nW) per comb element (that is, 30 nW per frequency component). 

ITEM NO. 0002, ACCEPTANCE TESTING OF ITEM NO. 0001:

Within seven days after delivery of the system to NIST, the Contractor shall send a representative to NIST to set up the system for acceptance testing and then perform acceptance testing in the presence of the NIST COTR to demonstrate that the system at least meets all specifications.  The COTR and, if applicable, their designees, may also verify that the system is capable of generating a comb of stable frequencies when locked to an appropriate RF source.  Frequency differences between a comb component and a NIST stabilized laser will be observed by the COTR to verify that the system establishes a servolock.  The stability of the servolock will be tested by the COTR and, if applicable, their designees to confirm its stability to at least specification #1 above.  In addition, other aspects of the system will be tested and shall conform with specifications noted above.

NIST will only accept Item No. 0001 and Item No. 0002 if Item No. 0001 meets or exceeds all specifications, as verified through acceptance testing procedures noted above.

The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:

52.204-7; 52.212-1; 52.212-3; 52.212-4; 52.212-5, including subparagraphs: 52.203-6; 52.219-6; 52.219-8; 52.219-14; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.225-13; 52.232-30; and 52.232-33.

The Government intends to award a firm-fixed pri ce Purchase Order for 12 Dynamometer Engine Test Stands for 6 different types of operational engines supplied by the Government. These are the minimum requirements and specifications for the Dynamometer Test Stands to be built or manufactured.  The Dynamom eter Test Stand will be used as a training aid to assist the instructor to validate the task performance to standards.  This training aid is required for the proper troubleshooting procedures and to provide a more realistic training with the capability of performing the diagnostic testing on a running engine.  The use of this equipment lowers the overall risk level to the Government by not having to pull engines out of vehicles while maintaining the current hours of instruction. Purpose of the Dynamometer: The Dyno is used to simulate the road test that is expected out in the field after students perform the maintenance repairs. Minimum required features on the Engine Test Stands:  1. Portable, heavy-duty engine test stands that can withstand the vibration a nd torque of the engine and be moved easily to different locations within the shop facilities. Requires having removable casters to make it stationary when in used. 2. No open source of water is available. The Dyno cooling has to be a closed loop system pa rt of the test stand. 3. The control panel needs to include as a minimum the following reading capabilities:  torque gauge, load control system, inlet temperature gauge, outlet temperature gauge, hydraulic pressure gauge (DYNO specific), oil pressure gauge , coolant temperature gauge, ignition switch, throttle control, fuel control (Pounds per Square Inch (PSI)), emergency shut off and charging gauge. 4.  The engine needs to be powered up by batteries on the stand as well as a Direct Current (DC) (24V) exter nal source through a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) jack. 5.  Engine fault panel (electrical, air, fuel, charging, mechanical) with toggle switches and warning lights need to be incorporated as part of the test stand to induce specific faults fo r diagnostic training performance of our students. Each fault panel must be unique to each Engine.  Schematic of all faults need to be included with the Dyno. 6.  The fuel tank needs to be on the test stand (minimum 15-20 gal). 7.  Electronic throttle cont rol required per engine specification. 8.  Glow-plug power supply and support required. 9.  The testing of all of the engines at the vendors test site will be under Government supervision or subject to Government approval. 10.  Customer Owner's Manual for each dynamometer to include parts listings, and On-Site Training required. 11.  Technical support is required onsite, phone, email and 24 hour. 12.  Delivery of first three units in 120 days based upon the receipt of complete operational engines - QUOTE EN GINE STANDS WITH AND WITHOUT OEM ENGINES. 13.  Vendor to pick-up engines from the Government and deliver them installed in test stands and provide turnkey process - stand ready to operate. 14.  One-year warranty required with technical support and service proposal following one year. 15.  Student observation platforms are required. 16.  Engines are to be retrofitted to allow for frequent disassembly and adjustmen t by students. 17.  Safety features covering noise, vibration and Hazmat. 18.

SECTION D – CONTRACT DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS, OR ATTACHMENTS

The following documents are made a part of this RFQ and any resultant purchase order:

1. CAR 1352.211-70 Statement of Work/Specifications (Mar 2000). The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and services to perform the following statement of work/specifications:

a.  PURPOSE AND LOCATION: The status of the right whale in the North Atlantic is one of the most critical endangered species issues on the East Coast. The population of approximately 300 is stable at best, but probably declining, and vessel strikes are a major source of mortality. Efforts to address vessel strikes required Presidential intervention to pass a Mandatory Ship Reporting System (MSR) through the International Maritime Organization (IMO).  This year, Congress provided NOAA Fisheries approximately $10 million for right whale recovery efforts.

The purpose of this acquisition is to increase and improve NOAA Fisheries’ communications with federal, commercial and recreational maritime representatives (including shipping industry representatives, port agents/ports authorities, harbor masters, shipping/ports/maritime associations, vessel pilot organizations, cruise lines, Navy, Coast Guard, Corps of Engineers, and other state and federal vessel interests.), provide outreach and education regarding the plight of the critically endangered northern right whale, and show what can be done to prevent vessel collisions with these and other whales. The Contractor shall also communicate to commercial and recreational vessel operators and representatives the status of NOAA Fisheries’ efforts to implement ship strike reduction and related plans, obtain feedback from user groups, alert NOAA Fisheries to potential issues, and assist in resolving problems.  The specific goals are these: 
	(1) Implement an education and outreach program informing commercial mariners of:
(a) The critical status of right whales and current right whale-related issues;
(b) How to mitigate vessel-related threats to right whales;
(c) NOAA Fisheries’ efforts to implement ship strike reduction and related plans for right whales; and
(d) The need for and importance of participating in these programs.
	(2) Achieve cooperation and compliance with voluntary and regulatory means of reducing the potential for whale/vessel collisions.
	(3) Work together with these entities in developing possible regulatory measures such as seasonal vessel routing requirements or speed restrictions.
	(4) Develop and facilitate implementation of an outreach strategy for recreational vessel operators. 

Location is flexible, but ideally, the Contractor would be located in the Fernandina Beach or Jacksonville, FL area.  However, the area of responsibility shall be from North Carolina to Melbourne, Florida.

b. SCOPE OF WORK: Over the 12-month time-frame, 9/29/2005 to 9/28/2006, the Contractor will be responsible for developing, fostering, and maintaining partnerships with the shipping community in the area from North Carolina to Melbourne, Florida.  Partnerships shall be established and maintained at all levels, but particularly with shipping agents, shipping companies, port operator groups (port authorities as well as companies with private shipping facilities), local/regional marine transportation organizations, harbor pilot associations, and tug and barge operators, for the express purpose of increasing awareness of right whales and the need to adopt special operating procedures when traveling in or near the right whale Southeast U.S. critical habitat. The Contractor shall coordinate closely with the NOAA Fisheries SE right whale conservation program coordinator and the Chair of the Southeast Implementation Team (SEIT) for the Recovery of the Northern Right Whale. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with similar counterparts in the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Regional Office.

	(1) SEIT Requirements: The Contractor shall participate in SEIT semi-annual meetings and other related projects as needed. SEIT-related responsibilities shall include refining and implementing the newly developed education and outreach strategy initiated by the SEIT and facilitating the development and distribution of outreach materials by industry-related organizations represented by SEIT members (i.e. port authorities could be doing more to assist in education and outreach efforts). The Contractor shall also investigate and propose incentive programs for encouraging marine transportation best management practices to better protect right whales.  

	(2) Mandatory Ship Reporting System (MSR): Examine MSR compliance data supplied by NOAA Fisheries or Coast Guard (CG) to identify potential trends in noncompliance. Work with industry and CG Marine Safety Offices (MSO) to increase the MSR compliance rate. Inform the mariner community of MSR requirements. Provide input to the NOAA Fisheries’ MSR committee, as requested or necessary, to maintain and enhance the MSR.    

	(3) Identify and Attend Industry Meetings and Conduct Site Visits: The Contractor shall identify potential commercial ship and tug/barge-related organizations, maritime organizations, harbor pilot associations, and port authorities that exist within the area of responsibility, but are not included in Appendix A. The Contractor shall include the previously unknown organizations in the table presented in Appendix A. Additionally, the Contractor shall identify and include meeting schedules in the table for each of the added organizations.

	An updated electronic and hard copy of the data table shall be provided to NOAA Fisheries no later than October 2005. Updates to the data table shall be provided in electronic and hard copy to NOAA Fisheries as addenda to subsequent monthly reports.

	The Contractor shall contact the appropriate organization representative and offer to present right whale-related information at meetings of the following organizations in the specified months:

Organization	Month 
NC State Ports Authority	Oct, Dec, Feb, Apr
Maritime Association of the Port of Charleston	Oct, Dec, Feb, Apr
Savannah Maritime Association	Nov, Dec, Jan, Mar
Jacksonville Marine Transportation Exchange	Nov-Mar

	During presentations at these meetings, the Contractor shall apprise maritime interests (as outlined above) of NOAA Fisheries’ requirement under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to develop measures to essentially eliminate right whale/vessel collisions and work directly with these entities to develop possible solutions to the problem Atlantic-wide, but with particular emphasis on the area of responsibility.

	(4) Harbor Pilot Associations: The Contractor shall attempt to attend all regularly scheduled meetings for the harbor pilot associations identified in Section b(3) of this scope of work and, particularly, prior to the estimated seasonal arrival of right whales in the area of operation for each harbor pilot association. Additionally, the Contractor shall appraise maritime interests (as outlined above) of NOAA Fisheries’ requirements under the ESA to develop measures to essentially eliminate right whale/vessel collisions and work directly with these entities to develop possible solutions to the problem Atlantic-wide, but with particular emphasis in the area of responsibility. The Contractor shall provide right whale educational materials/packages for harbor pilots to distribute directly to the owners and operators of ships within their sphere of influence.  

	(5) Develop and Implement Management Strategies/Regulations: The Contractor shall work with NOAA Fisheries in developing and drafting recommendations to the IMO and/or Coast Guard regarding possible regulatory restrictions on vessel traffic in the Southeast right whale calving grounds, and shall work with NOAA Fisheries regions and Headquarters (HQ), as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, to draft such regulations via the Coast Guard and/or IMO channels. The Contractor shall review and update Coast Pilot language, as necessary. The Contractor shall review, compile, and summarize all CG-related notices to mariners regarding right whales, to include local notice to mariners (LNM), broadcast notice to mariners (BNM), and Maritime Safety Broadcasts (Navtex). Information shall be provided no later than the November 2005 monthly report to NOAA Fisheries. The Contractor shall also suggest appropriate enhancements to these notices, as necessary, and recommend other CG publications that may be underused.

	(6) Reporting and Invoicing: The Contractor shall provide the COTR with informal verbal progress reports as frequently as is deemed necessary by the COTR. In addition to information specified above, monthly progress reports shall consist of summaries listing industry meetings attended, ports visited, number of maritime interests the Contractor met with (including contact information for all key parties involved), number of workshops conducted, and all other relevant contacts that occurred during the reporting period. The report shall describe the outcome of these various contacts, the conclusions and recommendations voiced at meetings, and all other results from those contacts. Finally, monthly reports will include information on plans to attend future meetings in the subsequent month. (i.e. The March report shall contain information on plans to attend April meetings.)

	At least semiannually, the reports shall also provide recommendations for additional informational (e.g. research needs), strategies, or monetary resources that may help inform and improve NOAA Fisheries’ efforts to prevent whale/vessel collisions.

	The Contractor may invoice for services after submission of mandatory monthly progress reports. The Contractor will be reimbursed for travel costs up to amounts authorized under the current NOAA government travel regulations. All invoices shall include the contract number and a complete description of the service for easy identification. Payment for services shall be contingent upon successful completion of the above requirements, including the participation in maritime organization meetings as specified in Section b (3).

c. EXPECTED RESULTS AND BENEFITS: A number of recommendations have been made to NOAA Fisheries regarding how to achieve reduction in whale/vessel collisions. Such recommendations have included a strong public outreach component.  There is a great need to continue to develop and enhance industry contacts, provide the shipping industry with information on right whales, and initiate and maintain continuous dialogue with maritime organizations about ship-strike prevention. There are also needs for distributing region-specific outreach materials; reporting on mariners' current knowledge of (1) right whales and their plight, in general; (2) how to identify right whales; and (3) how to avoid them; and eliciting additional industry recommendations for practicable and effective means to further reduce the potential for collisions. It is also hoped that having an individual work directly with the maritime industry will promote a spirit of cooperation and ultimately result in a better, more effective whale interaction prevention program that will have better industry support and better compliance.

d. DELIVERABLES: 
(1) The Contractor shall provide input on the development of outreach materials, as needed, and shall ensure distribution of these materials via meetings, workshops, mailings, and other available means.
(2) Monthly progress reports shall be provided to the COTR within 7 days following the completion of a calendar month (i.e. January progress report will be submitted by February 7) and will summarize progress in ensuring that all mariners from North Carolina through Atlantic coastal Florida are aware of the right whale/vessel interaction issue and in obtaining their support of a plan to prevent such incidents. Monthly reports shall also include recommendations and suggested implementation strategies regarding any aspects the Contractor believes will benefit NOAA Fisheries’ whale/vessel collision prevention efforts, such as additional informational or fiscal resources that may aid NOAA Fisheries in development of a better vessel collision prevention program or summarizing and providing conclusions regarding mariners' concerns.

  The following shall also be submitted in or with the specified monthly report:

<DESC>Amendment No. A00001 is issued in order to provide answers to questions received concerning RFQ No. HSFEMW-05-Q-0052 and to extend the date for receipt of responses.  QUESTION:  Is the solicitation going to be using the same “Sold To” number as the previous Avaya EPN solicitation (i.e., HSFEMW-05-Q-0046) or is it a different organization?  ANSWER:  The  Avaya PBX is a “new site” and a new “Sold To” number can be created as DHS/S&T PIADC.  The only information that offerors need is that this PBX is a new system.  QUESTION:  The solicitation is asking for part numbers that are associated with a release of an  Avaya Communication Manager that is no longer available for new purchases.  The new release is an Avaya Communication Manager 3.0 but the solicitation is requesting a release 2.1.  Should offerors use the latest software release for the quote?  ANSWER:  Yes, offerors should be quoting the CM 3.0 version since the 2.0 is no longer available.  The date for receipt of responses is extended from 3:00 PM/EST 09/07/05 to 3:00 PM/EST 09/09/05.  No more questions will be entertained following this Amendment No. A00001.  END OF AMENDMENT NO. A00001 TO RFQ NO. HSFEMW-05-Q-0052.

<DESC>The synopsis is amended to answer questions from a prospective offeror.  The questions are as follows:

1.	Does the heating and cooling capacity per paragraph 3 (Basic Unit 1) of Attachment 1 need to meet the entire range of operating temperatures plus solar load specified in paragraph 21?
 
Paragraph 3 of the specification refers to the heating and cooling requirements, while Paragraph 21 refers to the insulation requirements. The two requirements are unrelated, and should be read as separate requirements for A/C / heating and insulation respectively.  The heating  and cooling capacity required remains as stated in Paragraph 3.

2.	In paragraph 3, what is the significance of the stipulated NOMINAL capacity?  

The term "nominal" refers to the manufacturers rating of minimum output requirements for AC/ heating and can be interpreted to mean an approximate value.

3.	Is the full 2 tons of heating and 4 tons of cooling expected at the specified extreme temperatures?

As stated in the answer to Question 1 above, the two specifications are unrelated, and should be read separately.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for Scallop and Habitat Surveys and is for FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical  Services.   The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10643, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05.    A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. Statement of Work, Background, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL) recently described a framework and implementation plans for ecological effects research on aquatic stressors.  One goal of this research is to develop stressor-response relationships and models linking habitat alteration and loss to responses in bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) populations.  The Atlantic Ecology Division (AED) is developing these models for the bay scallop and needs data on bay scallop abundance and recruitment and the habitats associated with this species. Nantucket Harbor in Nantucket, MA has one of the only remaining healthy and well managed population of bay scallops on the east coast of the U.S. and is the ideal location to examine these organism/habitat relationships. Description of Work, Scope: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct dive surveys at 48 sites within Nantucket Harbor on two separate occasions - once in summer and fall 2005 for a total of 96 sampling events.  In addition, the contractor shall measure juvenile scallop abundance via settlement into spat bags and collect water samples for chlorophyll measurements.  The Atlantic Ecology Division will provide the contractor with the location (latitude and longitude in the form of Global Positioning system (GPS) coordinates) of the sampling sites within Nantucket Harbor. Technical Requirements: The contractor shall conduct dive surveys at each location and record the abundance and size of bay scallops, the abundance and size of associated predators, and record basic habitat information.  The habitat data to be provided are as follows:	Presence/absence of eelgrass, Canopy height of eelgrass, Eelgrass density estimate (such as percent cover or shoot density), Presence/absence of macroalgae, Sediment type, Water depth, Turbidity/seston estimates, Dissolved oxygen, Water temperature, Salinity, Water pH.The contractor shall collect the data for all parameters listed above.   In addition, the contractor shall collect water samples at each sampling location using a protocol provided by AED and transport samples to AED after collection.  The protocol for water sampling will consist of collecting 1 liter of water, filtering the water on a GFF filter, freezing the sample, and shipping the frozen sample via a commercial shipping vendor to EPA at AED in Narragansett, RI  These water samples will be analyzed by scientists at AED for chlorophyll levels. The same locations shall be sampled in both fall and summer with 25 m diver transects. The contractor shall get estimates of bay scallop juveniles via the use of spat bags (mesh bags containing monofilament) within the harbor during the fall and summer months.  Spat bags will be located in the same areas as the dive surveys. A Quality Management Plan/Quality Assurance Project Plan that includes survey methods shall be provided and approved by AED?s Quality Assurance Officer prior to sampling.  Data from the dive surveys and spat bags shall be entered into a Microsoft Excel 2003 database ready for statistical analysis by AED.   Deliverables, The contractor shall provide: A Quality Management Plan/ Quality Assurance Project Plan, including the survey methods.  Alternate formats are acceptable; however, existing documentation shall have all elements. One copy of each completed field data sheet, including any quality control data. One hard copy and one electronic copy (in Microsoft Excel 2003) of the computer spreadsheets of the data files.  Data should be in spreadsheets based on location, date, and habitat type.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS:
	

1)  For cost effective measures would transformers with "cooling fins" be considered?
 	No cooling fins.

2)  For Bid option 2: 208Y/120 is a 3 phase voltage, not available from a 1-phase transformer. 
This is a typo: 1-phase transformer secondary for bid Option
 
3)  For Bid option 2:  Description does not make sense. what does " at 33 windsock and vice 10 Kva at 33 side rectifier" mean? 
This identifies the location so we know where the new transformers are to be installed. 

4)  Item 6- 15KVA 1-phase transformers, Please explain the [10KVA at 33 side rectifier] as we 
     find no 10KVA transf.'s listed. 
10KVA are being replaced with 15KVA.

5)  Will transformer approval drawings be required?
Yes, unless transformers have a standard footprint.

6)  Your combined synopsis/solicitation states that the contractor is to "and replace transformers". Is it our understanding that the contractor is to remove and dispose of the existing transformers? And if we are to replace the transformers, who is responsible to take care of the high voltage side (the utility company, CE or us)? 
	You as the vendor are to provide the transformers to the location in the shipping instructions, i.e. Norfolk Va 23511.  Removal of 60Hz transformers and installation of 50Hz transformers will be done by our Electric Shop or Maintenance Engineering.  You as the vendor will not be doing installation or removal.

<DESC>Request For Proposals for Transcripts of Congressional Hearings

The Office of International Information Programs (IIP/G/IR) of the U.S. Department of State assists IIP generally and the 174 overseas American Information Resource Centers (libraries) by acquiring a variety of online information resources for its use.   The U.S. Department of State (DOS) proposes to contract for same day English-language transcripts of Congressional hearings (all committees), as well as briefings by officials at the White House, Defense, State, and Justice Departments, Presidential statements, and as wide a range as possible of other speeches, statements, and press conferences by high level USG officials.  In addition, the DOS requires broad coverage and similar transcripts for foreign parliamentary hearings, media interviews, and press conferences with prominent foreign government officials on matters of foreign policy concern to the U.S, government.  These services will be made available on line by the contractor, via a web-based system, to IIP and IRC offices.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  The nature of the work is unclassified.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  The required transcripts and other materials shall be accessible on line by the various Washington, DC and overseas locations.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE is one base calendar year from the date of award with the option to extend up to four years.  HOW TO RESPOND:  Offerors must submit a proposal separated into two parts; a Capabilities Statement/Technical Proposal and a separate Cost/Price business proposal.  Capabilities Statement:  Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing this ability to: 1) provide transcripts of all hearings of Congressional committees and subcommittees, 2) provide transcripts of all White House, Defense, State, Justice and other cabinet department press briefings and official statements, 3) provide same day transcripts of the hearing, press conference, statements and other significant events related to the noted branches of government, 4) respond 24-hours a day  to requests from all American Information Centers worldwide.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  The technical proposal must address how the offeror plans to provide the required services.  Include the coverage of resources in terms of how many committee hearings and other sources of transcripts are included in the service, availability, and any necessary training.  COST/PRICE PROPOSAL:  Cost/Price Proposal must be separated from the Capabilities/Technical Proposal.  Include cost/price information for one base year with the option to extend up to four years.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS:  A technical evaluation panel will evaluate each Offeror’s Capabilities Statement/Technical Proposal separately from price proposal evaluation.  The contracting officer will evaluate Price/Cost proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to correct the response date (deadline for quotations) to be September 12, 2005.

Questions must be received by September 2, 2005, with responses being provided by Amendment on/about September 7, 2005.

The original RFQ is posted below.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

---------------

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6-streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The Solicitation number is SB1341-05-Q-0993.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.

THE TWO (2) CONTRACT LINE ITEMS FOR THIS RFQ, AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM, ARE AS FOLLOWS:

ITEM NO. 0001, SYSTEM THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS ALL MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS BELOW; QUANTITY: 1; UNIT: EACH.

MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS FOR ITEM NO. 0001: 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland required an optical frequency comb system to be used for optical frequency metrology, providing a comb of optical frequencies at multiples of the frequency of a radio frequency (RF) reference (at nominally 10 MHz).  Note: the RF reference source is not part of this procurement, but all other components necessary to generate a stabilized comb of optical frequencies are required.  

1. The comb system shall be capable of providing optical frequencies, at integer multiples of the reference frequency, with uncertainties at the 10 to the minus 12 level or better for averaging times in excess of 1 second (s).  (This assumes that NIST provides a correspondingly stable and accurate 10 Megahertz (MHz) RF reference.).

2. The system shall include a mode locked femtosecond (fs) laser along with all optical, optoelectronic, and electronic components needed for stabilization of the carrier offset frequency and stabilization of the repetition rate.  

3. The basic femtosecond laser, along with an included pulse compressor, should be capable of providing pulses with less than 100 fs width at an average power in excess of 160 milliwatt (mW). 

4. The carrier envelope offset (CEO) frequency will be stabilized via a self-referencing technique, in conjunction with generation of an octave-spanning output, a frequency to twice the frequency (f to 2f) interferometer, and a servo system to control the CEO frequency. 

5. The repetition rate of the laser (hence the spacing between individual frequencies of the output comb) shall exceed 90 MHz. 

6. Mechanisms shall be provided for adjustment of the length of the laser cavity, so that the repetition rate may be changed by at least 0.2 MHz.  It shall be possible to change the length of the reference cavity, make a corresponding change in the RF reference frequency, and re-establish locked operation (of the repetition rate and the CEO) without the need for additional adjustments of the system (such as realignment).   

7. The system shall be capable of providing a source for frequency metrology in both the visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum:  

7a. The octave-broadened output of the laser shall cover a range of 1000 nm to 2000 nm. (The exact values are not important: the two end points may differ from these values by as much as 15 %.)

7b: Second-harmonic generation shall be included to provide a frequency-doubled output in the visible, giving an output that can be adjusted over the spectral range from 530 nm to 700 nm. Within this spectral range, the second-harmonic output shall be capable of providing a power exceeding 30 nanowatt (nW) per comb element (that is, 30 nW per frequency component). 

ITEM NO. 0002, ACCEPTANCE TESTING OF ITEM NO. 0001:

Within seven days after delivery of the system to NIST, the Contractor shall send a representative to NIST to set up the system for acceptance testing and then perform acceptance testing in the presence of the NIST COTR to demonstrate that the system at least meets all specifications.  The COTR and, if applicable, their designees, may also verify that the system is capable of generating a comb of stable frequencies when locked to an appropriate RF source.  Frequency differences between a comb component and a NIST stabilized laser will be observed by the COTR to verify that the system establishes a servolock.  The stability of the servolock will be tested by the COTR and, if applicable, their designees to confirm its stability to at least specification #1 above.  In addition, other aspects of the system will be tested and shall conform with specifications noted above.

NIST will only accept Item No. 0001 and Item No. 0002 if Item No. 0001 meets or exceeds all specifications, as verified through acceptance testing procedures noted above.

The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:

52.204-7; 52.212-1; 52.212-3; 52.212-4; 52.212-5, including subparagraphs: 52.203-6; 52.219-6; 52.219-8; 52.219-14; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.225-13; 52.232-30; and 52.232-33. 

QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Offerors shall read FAR 52.212-1 and submit their quotation by email to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov in accordance with paragraph (b) of that provision.  Each quote shall include items (1) through (11) of FAR 52.212-1(b), TO INCLUDE PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION NOTED IN (10).  SPECIFICATIONS MUST NOT INCLUDE ANY PRICING INFORMATION; PRICING MUST BE INCLUDED AS A SEPARATE DOCUMENT FROM ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS.

Quotes must be received at Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov by 12:000p.m. Eastern Time on September 12, 2005. If any portion of the quotation cannot be transmitted by email, then it may be faxed to Joseph Widdup at fax (301) 975-8884.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

NIST intends to award a purchase order to the Offeror whose quote represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following factors: (1) Extent to which the offered system meets or exceeds the minimum specifications listed in this RFQ; (2) Past Performance Information; and (3) Evaluated Price. Factors (1) and (2) are equally important and, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor (3).

NOTE: Payments for Item No. 0001 will be made either (a) pursuant to FAR clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments for Commercial Items (which is incorporated by reference in clause 52.212-5 and applies to this acquisition) or (b) after the system is delivered and thereafter accepted.  Pricing for Item No. 0001 and Item No. 0002 shall be based on this policy.

QUESTIONS REGARDING RFQ

All potential Offerors that wish to ask questions shall submit them in writing to joseph.widdup@nist.gov by Friday, September 2, 2005.  NIST will provide written responses to all questions received by that date via an amendment to the solicitation no later than Wednesday, September 7, 2005.  NIST will not guarantee responses to questions received after that date.
