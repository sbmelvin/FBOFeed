<DESC>The Transportation Security Agency (TSA) is seeking sources for walk-through metal detectors (a.k.a. Enhanced Metal Detectors -EMDs) for use at our Nation’s airports. Offerors must submit a product that satisfies the TSA technical requirements. TSA will examine each Offeror’s response to this announcement to evaluate experience, existing product capabilities and production capabilities.  The TSA will establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the technical performance of each Offeror’s EMD against TSA specifications.  Only Offerors who respond to this announcement and who demonstrate they can fulfill TSA’s requirements will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  Only the offerors who are successfully included on the QPL will be eligible to compete for a possible contract award.  Placement on the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.    

INSTRUCTIONS 
There are 6 steps in this source selection process:

Step-1	Industry sources interested in participating in this procurement must respond to this announcement.  Responses must be received by Mr. Adam Freimanis or Ms. Melissa Conley no later than Monday July 17, 2006 5:30 P.M. EDT (see note).  The offeror must provide a white paper not to exceed 4 single-sided pages (12 pt font, 1inch margins, 8.5” x 11” paper) describing  walk- through metal detector experience.  Offerors must submit either a hard copy or electronic version.  The electronic version must be submitted in PDF format or read-only Word documents. The white paper must contain the following information:

1.	Models Produced:  All interested parties must submit a list of EMDs currently in production. Production history of each unit must also be provided, including month/year of initial production and quantity produced in each of the last six (6) months.

2.	  Manufacturing Capabilities: All interested parties must provide the location of manufacturing facilities in which current products are produced. Descriptions of these facilities must provide; size, number of employees, production capacity for each metal detector model, current operating level as a percentage of maximum capacity and the types of manufacturing operations performed in each facility.  Each company must also provide historical past performance references (min. of three references with POC information).  The past performance must reflect successful deployment of the walk through metal detectors currently available.

3.	Quality Assurance: Evidence of current ISO 9001:2000 or internationally recognized equivalent quality assurance standard compliance is mandatory.  All interested parties must be ISO 9001:2000 or have an internationally recognized equivalent quality assurance standard at the time of response to this announcement.  

4.	Point of Contact:  Company name and address, responsible individual, phone number and e-mail address.

5.    Security:   A signed copy of the Enhanced Metal Detector (EMD) Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Please send an email to adam.freimanis@dhs.gov and melissa.conley@dhs.gov requesting this form.

6.   Test Piece:  Each potential vendor will be required to enter into a bi-lateral bailment agreement.  This agreement will cover the policy for the loaning of equipment to the TSA for testing and will document the policies for the distribution of the MOCK-1E test piece.

This procurement action will be restricted to those companies that have been determined by the Government, based on information provided in their response to this announcement to be viable suppliers of walk-through metal detectors (a.k.a. EMD).  Failure to provide complete and accurate data or not being able to meet any of the requirements of Steps 1-6 may result in the vendor being disqualified from the EMD2 process

Step-2	For the companies that TSA deems eligible for the competition, the TSA will distribute the Test Requirements Kit (TRK).  The TRK includes but not limited to:  the password to the EMD Technical Requirements Document (TRD), the Management Plan for EMD Qualification Testing, and a Metal Object Calibration Kit (MOCK-1E).  TSA will distribute the TRK to the select companies within approximately three business weeks after the due date for the white papers.  A security check may be performed on each “selected” company prior to release of TRK.  The Government reserves the right to adjust the TRK distribution date.

Step-3	Offerors wishing to participate after review of the TRK, must submit up to three (3) units for the TSL test, conforming to the TRD (at no cost to the TSA) and a qualification data package (QDP) not to exceed 15 pages (12 pt font, 1 inch margin and 8.5 x 11 paper) providing evidence of conformance to the minimum requirements in the TRD.  The response date for completed QDPs will be approximately 90 days after release of the TRK.  The MOCK-1E must be returned with the unit samples and QDP or the Offeror’s submission will not be considered for award.	The submission date for the test units will be one week after the successful submission of the QDP.

Those companies not wishing to participate must return the MOCK-1E within 5 business days. Companies must send an e-mail to adam.freimanis@dhs.gov indicating this intention and destroy all copies of the TRD and the Management Plan for EMD Qualification Testing.  In addition to returning and signing an NDA, all potential vendors will be required to sign a Bailment Agreement with the TSA.  The bailment agreement will be distributed on the request of the individual vendors and will document the additional ramifications for not returning the MOCK-1E not specified in this announcement.

Those companies having questions regarding this solicitation must submit them not later than ten (10) business days after the posting date of this notice via e-mail to:   adam.freimanis@dhs.gov & melissa.conley@dhs.gov 

Step-4	TSA will conduct a QPL certification field test for Offerors who return the MOCK-1E test kit and have successfully completed the TSL test.  The amount of units, to be supplied at no cost to the Government for the QPL field test, will be provided in the TRK.

Step-5	TSA will distribute an RFP (Request for Proposal) to all venders whose product(s) are placed on the QPL.  Placement on the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.    

Step-6	TSA will provide a pre-proposal conference within fifteen (15) days of RFP release.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.  Only proposals from qualified Offerors will be evaluated for award.  Inclusion to the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.

Note: Priority and “express” mail delivery times(to include FedEx, UPS, DHL and others) to the TSA are usually 3-4 days longer than standard  delivery times for these  types of mail.  Standard USPS mail generally arrives as fast if not faster than all other types of mail.   White papers can be mailed, dropped off at TSA HQ or sent electronically. To mail white papers send them to:

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), has a requirement to purchase an Automated Spiral Plater, VS2 Vacuum Source and Q-Count – 510 Cell Counter for plating and enumeration of biological organisms.  We believe Spiral Biotech, Inc. is the only available source.  The Autoplate 4000 spiral plater has unique features that will be necessary for spreading biological cells on agar plates that are used for culturing purposes.  This also allows a consistent enumeration of biological cells on the plate.   We are unaware of any other comparable spiral plater on the market that provides:   
1) Validation device matched to individual plater to assure accuracy and meets GLP
Guidelines;  
2) Contains an Expel Mode for recovering unused sample or for use with samples of high particulate content;  
3) Power clean mode for cleaning/sterilizing stylus of high concentrations (up to 10 to the 8th cfu/ml) of Gram-positive bacterial spores;  and 
4) Stainless steel work surface for durability and spill resistance.
The VS2 vacuum source is important to regulate the vacuum in the plater for optimal functioning.    
The cell counter system must allow the counting of cells on several plates in a short period of time.  The unique features of the QCount-510 cell counter are:  
1) Allows use of a High resolution digital camera;  
2) Contains a Firewire USB Connection;  
3) No threshholding when reading different plates;  
4) Ability to edit individual colonies as well as group edit functions;  
5) Color imaging and/or color differentiation option;  
6) Networking capabilities and LIMS capatibility;  
7) Ability to read either Spread, Spiral and Pour plates; and
8) 24 hour, 7-day a week customer service support.

Responsible sources that believe they can provide comparable equipment meeting our needs, as identified above, are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their specifications, capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: James Ambrozic, Reference: #JA000HCCC3-2006-33079, JAmbrozic@cdc.gov.

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with Spiral Biotech, Inc. as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Order under NAWCAD/NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Number N00421-05-G-0001 for incorporating aerial refueling (AR) capability onto both the E-2C and E-2D aircraft. The tasking relating to this effort can be divided into three categories. The first is evaluating data collected during the E-2 In-Flight Refueling  (IFR) Demonstration Program. The second task is developing a comprehensive description of design risks and/or design deficiencies related to but not limited to aircraft flying qualities and pilot field of view. The third task is the development of viable design and/or operational concepts that will either eliminate or mitigate identified risks/deficiencies.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate this order on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman System Corporation (NGSC), 600 Grumman Road West, Bethpage, New York 11714.  NGSC is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer and systems integrator of the E-2C aircraft. NGSC also has proprietary data rights for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which will be required to complete this effort. CFD math models will be used to predict the temperature, velocities and pressure for the E-2 IFR Demonstration Program. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD),Code 60, has a requirement for Financial Analyst Support Services. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Donna M. Russell, Rockville, Maryland, and award a firm-fixed price purchase order under the authority provided in FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The various financial tasks to be performed require knowledge and practical experience in the use of DOD, NAVSEA and NSWCCD business systems (including DIFMS, STARS, CDB, COBRA, NAFI and ILSMIS) as well as knowledge and practical experience of the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) appropriation organizations, budget processes and governing regulations.  Ms. Russell’s 15 years experience as an Accounting Technician and as a Budget Analyst in the Comptroller Departments of NSWC, Carderock Division, and NSWC, Dahlgren Division, have provided her with specialized knowledge and experience with DOD, NAVSEA and NSWCCD business systems (including DIFMS, STARS, CDB, COBRA, NAFI and ILSMIS); Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) appropriation organizations, budget processes and governing regulations. NWCF-funded organizations themselves are very unique and represent a very small percentage within the “big Navy”—essentially just limited to the NSWC and NTJWC laboratories.  Ms. Russell's possesses vast experience in cumulative and comprehensive NWCF (and NSWC) accounting and budgetary processes. Her comprehensive knowledge is unique because she has “big picture” knowledge of all aspects of the processes and accompanying business systems involved in NSWCCD funds management. Such comprehensive knowledge is of invaluable aid in troubleshooting and fixing problems anywhere along the acceptance, costing and expensing pathways. It is also comprehensive knowledge that is limited to government or ex-government employees. Current and previous contractor employees in the NSWCCD Accounting or Budget Offices are (or have been) fire-walled off from many of the existing systems and they can only work on certain tasks overseen by a government employee. Through Ms. Russell’s past NSWC employment she has been able to accumulate a unique baseline of knowledge of business practices and systems that is of direct application to resolving multiple types of Code 60-incurred funds costing or expensing problems. Her previous government work brought her into contact with major sponsors like NAVSEA, ONR, NRL, etc, and she routinely interacted with Code 60 staff, program mangers, AO’s, and program analysts. Knowledge of directorate personnel and sponsors combined with her accumulated skill knowledge and knowledge of the inner workings of NSWCCD business systems means she can not only help fix problems but she can better educate Code 60 AO’s in the proper handling of cost overruns, labor transfers, identifying and correcting errors in the system, and researching and resolving contractual cost growth problems. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this propose!  d contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 07/14/2006.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), requires the services of an experimental sediment basin to aid in determining the flow stream lines beneath nuclear aircraft carriers (CVN).Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Texas A&M University and award a firm-fixed price purchase order under the authority provided in FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The NSWC Carderock Division has generated, through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) the streamlines from the sea chest at the baseline of the nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) when it is transiting in a channel under “deadstick” mode. The CFD streamlines have been formulated for a non-deformable bed. It is thought that the streamlines of the outflow sea chests will be altered due to deformation in the sediment of the channel bottom. There is also a need to know how much sediment will be entrained in the water column. In order to validate this CFD output, Carderock Division requires the services of an experimental sediment basin to aid in determining the flow stream lines beneath the CVN. The objectives of the experiment are threefold. First, the results of the experiment will be used to determine the amount of bed deformation due to a jet of water impinging on the bottom. The second objective is to determine the amount of sediment entrainment in the water column due to the impinging jet. Third, the experiment will help determine the change in both the jet’s flow rate and  The experiments needed by the Carderock Division require a basin with a towing carriage that can be outfitted with a 5 inch diameter nozzle to generate a jet that will impinge on a bed composed of fine sand. The towing carriage must be able to travel at least 2 meters per second on a rail above the basin controlled by a computer for consistent carriage speeds with each run. The basin must have viewing ports for taking videos of each run, capability to measure the jet velocities both near the jet nozzle and at the sediment bed with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter with a sampling rate of 20 Hz and a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) technique. The laboratory must also be able to measure the changes in the sediment bed due to the jet. The sediment pit must be long enough and deep enough to ensure the veracity of the experiments measuring at least 25 feet long and 5 feet deep. The basin itself should be at least 150 feet long and 12 feet wide to ensure the carriage will be up t!  o speed over the sediment pit, which is the test section, and have enough room to slow down to a stop after the test section. The Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at the Texas A&M University fits all the required attributes for the NSWC Carderock Division test. Its dimensions for the experimental basin are within the range, and it is the only facility in the United States with the ability to place a support structure on it’s carriage for mounting the 5 inch diameter jet nozzle and operate the carriage at speeds up to 2 m/s with a sediment pit. Other facilities with towing capability are either not equipped with a deep sediment pit or the carriage cannot support the payload. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 07/14/2006.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

Title:  Affymetrix Fluidic Station (FS450)

Purpose/Brief History:  The NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is dedicated to studying genetic determinants of upper gastrointestinal cancer as part of a global effort to develop strategies for the prevention of these cancers. To accomplish our goals, we analyze; A) Germline DNA to characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP patterns; B) Somatic DNA from tumors to characterize loss of heterozygosity (LOH), copy number alterations, mutations, and methylation; C) RNA from tumors and normal tissues (including peripheral lymphocytes) for expression profiling; and D) Proteins from tumors and normal tissues for protein expression differences.  The major analytic platform used in our laboratory is the Affymetrix chip-based system for the analysis of SNP and expression array chips.  This system requires use of the Affymetrix FS450 Fluidic Station.  

Part II   Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b)

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A

Purpose/Brief History:

The Genetics Branch of the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of mechanisms of Cancer in humans.

These Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A are in-situ synthesized oligo microarrays.  They consist of microscope slides arrayed with 244,000 target sequences for genes.  Each slide contains a single array allowing profiling of whole genome-wide aberrations on a single chip.

Microarrary analysis is an integral technique to the function of Genetics Branch.  Although previously, arrays were used only to interrogate the expression status of cancer samples, now with the advent of CGH microarray technology, we are able to investigate genomic alterations including amplification and deletion events, which are significant to carcinogenesis and cancer progression.

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

These Human Genome CGH Microarrays are truly a unique and advanced approach to addressing sensitivity and resolution issues in CGH analysis.  Agilent went to great lengths in the design of these arrays to validate and optimize the performance of the oligos on this array to guarantee their high quality.  The dense placement of elements allows interrogation of the whole genome on a single slide, and the resolution (244,000 elements) and sensitivity of the design allows performance unavailable through any other commercial source.  These arrays will be used in the Genetics Branch Agilent Array Scanner and only Agilent arrays are compatible with this scanner.

<DESC>Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a property in Northern Virginia under a lease that expires on April 1, 2008. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 593,100 rentable square feet of office and related space, including 1,014 secure parking spaces.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 539,183 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (previously referred to as usable). The space must be provided within one building or within a complex of no more than three neighboring buildings of similar construction and security.  The delineated area for this requirement is Northern Virginia.

The building(s) must be located outside of any 100-year floodplain and on a secure site incorporating a government-approved setback distance from other buildings and vehicular traffic.  The Government must be the only tenant in these buildings.  Proximity to a Metrorail station is required.  The building must meet Government standards for fire and life safety and accessibility. Space on the roof for antennae is required.  The space must be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  

 The lease term requirement is 10 years.  The space must be ready for occupancy by March 1, 2008.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing leased space or to relocate.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government"s requirements all at once or over a one or two year phase-in period.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

These are original manufactures equipment/parts (OME) that are compatible with the sockets and hardware that is already in use. This is common use equipment for both hydroelectric plants and a ll SCADA systems and allows maintenance personnel from each plant to complete repairs at other plants with minimal downtime. Interchange of spare parts between plants is critical to maintain lower cost and high reliability.  To change from OME parts would impact the Corps by increasing down time, losing investments in equipment and installation costs and pose compatibility problems between current equipment and replacement equipment if another vendor were selected.  Interested persons may identify their int erest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of d etermining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>D -- NEC Maintenance and Follow-On Service - Region 6 - Aggregated Switch Procurement
<SOLNBR>6TS-06-JAS-0003
<RESPDATE>072106
<ARCHDATE>08052006
<CONTACT>Jacqueline  Simington, Contracting Officer, Phone 816-823-3282, Fax 816-926-1607, Email jackie.simington@gsa.gov
<DESC>Amendment No. 1 is issued and is attached as uploaded files,  The Proposal due date (closing date) has been extended to 3:00pm, CST, July 21, 2006.  Price schedules also revised and replaced entirely.  Solicitation Notice.  Solicitation Number is 6TS-06-JAS-0003.  This is a Solicitation Notice, the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be posted on FBO on or about June 16, 2006.  This procurement is for the NEC Telecommunications Switch Maintenance and Follow-On Services for Government-owned NEC switching systems located in the Region 6 Area. (Current service locations are Kansas City St. Louis, and Springfield, MO; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, KS; and Lincoln, NE).  GSA may also order equipment, services, new PBX systems and/or maintenance of additional systems, located within this Region’s four state geographic boundary Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska.  The Government may also utilize this contract as a source of supply for the purchase, installation, maintenance and miscellaneous services for NEC proprietary instruments, key system equipment, and ancillary devices and cabling and wiring.  The Government has determined that ONLY NEC Authorized Distributors can submit offers as prime contractors under this solicitation. All offerors submitting proposals must provide proof of their status as a NEC Authorized Distributor. The proposing contractor will be required to furnish a current letter of good standing or a manufacturer’s support commitment letter from NEC.  Brand Name Justification for NEC is as follows:  1. Maintenance Service from NEC Authorized Distributors.  In order to maintain warranties and upper level technical support on the equipment, the manufacturer requires maintenance services be provided by authorized distributors of the equipment.  Upper level technical support, which NEC calls NTAC (NEAX Technical Assistance Center), is support from the highest level technical experts at the manufacturer (NEC).  It is used to investigate, assess and solve problems which are too difficult or systemic to be solved by the local technicians.  If this service is not available some problems could potentially not be correctable, which could cause the system to be inoperable or unable to provide certain needed functions.  The risk of harm to the Government resulting from the loss of warranty protection and inability to provide adequate service to our customers is far greater than any short term financial savings that might be gained from having a non-authorized maintenance provider.  2.  Telephone Sets.  The only options for desk telephone sets that can be used with the NEC PBXs are basic analog, single line sets or D-Term digital sets.  The analog sets do not allow the user to easily access much of the functionality that is built into the PBX.  Some features are not available at all with an analog set, and others are available only by dialing a specific feature code for each feature.  Examples of commonly used features are call pickup, 3-way calling, transferring, call forwarding, speed dialing, call waiting and direct voice mail access.  Our experience has shown that most customers heavily rely on these features.  The proprietary telephone sets manufactured by NEC allow users to easily utilize all of these features by simply pressing a button on the telephone.   3.  NEC Electronic Circuit Cards.  Electronic circuit cards inserted into the PBXs provide the connectivity and functionality of the equipment.  These cards are only manufactured by NEC; there are no alternative manufacturers.  NEC sells these cards only to registered owners or authorized distributors of the specific product. (End of NEC Brand Name Justification).

This procurement will be full and open competition restricted to NEC authorized distributors with OEM Certifications.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The term of the contract will be a base period of one (1) year with four (4) one-year options.  The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract will be $7,000,000 over the 5 year life.  The minimum guaranteed amount will be $50,000 for the base year and $50,000 for each option year, if exercised.  Proposals will be due 3:00pm, local time, July 21, 2006.  Send inquiries and questions to Jackie Simington via email at Jackie.simington@gsa.gov or by Fax to (816) 823-3322.  A pre-proposal meeting will be held in Kansas City, MO on Tuesday, June 27, 2006 at 10:00 a.m.   Please e-mail to address on the form Form A-1 which is included in RFP, Part A, to Rick Reynolds or fax to 816-926-6332 to reserve a spot.   Site tour of locations in Kansas City will be conducted following the Pre-proposal conference on June 27, 2006 at 10:00am (CST).   This procurement is full and open, and not set aside under FAR Part 19.

<DESC>Capable sources are sought to satisfy the requirements of the Databases for the 21st Century III (DB 21 III) Program.  DB21 III has two main objectives and components: 1) ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M).  To provide Level-of-Effort (LOE) data engineering, information engineering; engineering, systems engineering, software engineering, henceforth referred to as engineering, and information management and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) for the information requirements of the Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC), San Antonio, TX; the Air Force Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC), Langley AFB, VA; and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Information Handling Branch's (IFEB) DODIIS Information Technology (IT) Program (IFEB/IT), Rome, NY.  LOE includes O&M of developmental and operational intelligence databases, networks, systems and the development and application of new data/information services and information management techniques; and 2) TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND APPLICATION.  The primary technology objective is to advance, apply, and transition AFRL Information & Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) Information Systems Science and Technology (S&T) to meet AFIWC, AFC2ISRC, and IFEB/IT Program's unique requirements for Information Dominance and Information Technology (IT).  The secondary technology objective is to leverage, extend and transition the S&T developed for the AFIWC, AFC2ISRC, and IFEB/IT to satisfy the information requirements of the Air Force (AF), Department Of Defense Intelligence Information System (DODIIS), Intelligence Community (IC), Command and Control (C2) Community, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community and the warfighter.  For both components, the focus will be on Intelligence, Information Warfare (IW), Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Command, Control, and Communications (C3), and C4ISR data, databases, data modeling, data architectures, data flows, data dissemination, data services, data interoperability, data/information management, and related products and systems of the AFIWC, AFC2ISRC, and DODIIS IT and Regional Service Centers (RSCs).  Anticipated deliverables include development of computer software, databases, system enhancements, models, architectures and associated technical documentation. An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Term and Completion type orders is contemplated with an ordering period of sixty (60) months. Potential offerors are encouraged to recommend an alternative contract type(s) for orders and provide rationale for the recommendation. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is $49,800,000. The prime contractor and/or system integrators for this contract must have an appropriate number of key personnel (approximately 40) having access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or be clearable (Final US Top Secret Clearance without waiver and a Special Background investigation either on record or in process) that will be available for assignment to this effort immediately upon contract award (total for the prime and all subcontractors).  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside. Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees. Respondents to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000). As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules. The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside. Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award. See Numbered Note 25. This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision. Provide information on at least three (3) contracts for similar work within the past five (5) years.

<DESC>SUBJECT: The National Marine Fisheries (NMFS), located in Stennis space Center, MS intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Sea-Bird electronics, Inc. (SBE), for a SBE 911 Conductivity, Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (CTD) System. Aging scientific equipment on a Research Vessel (RV) Carretta requires replacement in order to provide quality data for fisheries stock estimates and management. The single instrument performing measurements on the R/V  Carretta, is the SBE-25, manufactured by Sea Bird Electronics. The SBE-25 along with the individual sensors, a personal computer, Sea Bird proprietary software, and an oceanographic winch form an integrated data acquisition system on the RV Carretta. The scientific crew responsible for oceanographic data on Gordon Gunter, Oregon II, and R/V Gandy are also responsible for the data on R/V Carretta. Oregon II, Gordon Gunter and Gandy are equipped with Sea Bird SBE-911 Plus systems. This system uses the same sensor software, and maintenance/deployment procedures as the SBE-25. Operation and maintenance personnel are rotated between the four vessels, standardization among the vessels is required to avoid confusion and mistakes resulting in erroneous data.  All computer hardware and software must be the brand name or equal to the current software in use.

The equipment to be replaced must have the following brand name or equal capabilities:

1.Real time sampling of conductivity, temperature, depth(pressure), dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light transmittance at a rate of 24 samples per second.

d.Dissolved Oxygen – 2% of saturation level, 12 bit  digitization
e.Chlorophyll Fluorescence – 12 bit digitization
f.Light Transmittance – 12 bit digitization

3.Telemetry system must be capable of single wire operation up to 350 ohms.
4.Must be compatible with existing NOAA inventory of Seabird conductivity, temperature, and Dissolved Oxygen sensors.
5.Must be compatible with existing NOAA inventory of Wet Labs C-STAR transmissometers and WETSTAR flourometers.
6.Operating depth of 600 M with full sensor suite, 6800 M without Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Light Transmittance sensors.
7.Data acquisition and processing software – The instrument must be fully compatible with the following functions of Seabird’s Seasoft software:

a.	All operator interfaces.
b.	All instrument I/O functions.
c.	Raw and processed data output formats.

To obtain the highest possible absolute accuracy, the equipment must incorporate the following key features:
-A single temperature sensor that is both accurate and fast
-A conductivity sensor with a totally internal field that is immune to proximity effects
-Provide constant (pumped) flow, providing constant time responses in T and C
-A  TC Duct to ensure that the temperature and conductivity sensors measure the same water
-A dramatically superior quartz pressure sensor
-Modular sensors that can be separately calibrated
-Acquisition electronics free of significant error

Delivery is 30 after the receipt of  the order. The government knows of no other company able to supply this type of equipment besides Se-Bird.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make an award to an 8(a) company. This is a five year contract (09/30/06 to 09/29/11). Interested vendors can call Vidya Vish at 202-245-6167 or email Vidya.vish@ed.gov.  Please submit your capability Statements     electronically by 12 P.M on Thursday, May 11, 2006.

The purpose of the study is:

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education has the following mission: (1) to collect and analyze education information and statistics in a manner that meets the highest methodological standards; (2) to report education information and statistics in a timely manner; and (3) to collect, analyze, and report education information and statistics in a manner that (A) is objective, secular, neutral, and non-ideological and is free of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias; and (B) is relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public.

NCES collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states, local education agencies, and postsecondary institutions in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities, providing policy-relevant data on issues as diverse as enrollment trends, access of minorities to postsecondary education, the academic achievement of students, comparisons of the U.S. education system with education systems in other countries, and the association between education and economic productivity.

The Decennial Census School District 2000 Project provides NCES with a vehicle for identifying special data tabulations containing aggregated data describing attributes of children, families, and households in each school district in the Nation.  This project brings together school district geographic boundaries as obtained through a Department of Education sponsored survey of state liaisons on school district geography (funded through the Title 1 Program) with the census data.  Paper and digitized maps developed by the individual states are sent to the Census Bureau; the Census Bureau transforms this information to a TIGER/Line file format as a means to tabulate address-oriented data.  Once mapped, census blocks are uniquely associated with their respective school districts.  Census tabulation blocks are then aggregated to provide estimates for school districts, counties, states, and the U.S. using both long and short form data.  The data are tabulated for different types of school districts (elementary, secondary, unified), various age categories of children, and households and families.  Virtually, all long and short form data elements are used for these special tabulations.

<SUBJECT>R -- SETA Support
<DESC>The MDA intends to award, based on FAR Part 6.302-2, two sole source cost-plus-fixed fee contracts to incumbents Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Sparta, Inc. to provide for continued Scientific, Engineering, Technical Assistance (SETA) support to the Director, Systems Engineering and Integration, in the Washington, DC area during the transition to an MDA reengineered organization and the transfer of major systems engineering functions to Huntsville, AL.   Within two years, as transfer plans are finalized and facilities are made available, MDA intends to competitively award a contract for SETA support to MDA Systems Engineering in the Huntsville, AL and begin the phased move of work and government personnel from Washington, DC to Huntsville, AL.   MDA intends to complete the transfer of work within the five year period.  

These SETA bridge contracts will be for a base period of 1 year with four 1-year options.  As options are exercised, the SOW will be tailored to reduce the scope of work as responsibility is transferred to Huntsville, AL.  An initial level-of-effort (LOE) is approximately 80 Man-Year Equivalents (MYEs) and will be reduced by phases to approximately 20 MYEs to support system engineering work remaining in the Washington, DC area.   At the completion of the transition, MDA intends to competitively award a follow-on contract for SETA support in the Washington, DC area which will include the Systems Engineering functions relocated to MDA HQ, Ft Belvoir, VA.  

CSC and SPARTA are embedded members of a unique engineering entity referred to as the Missile Defense System Engineering Team (MDSET) National Team.  The MDSET consists of individuals from Industry (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics), Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) (Aerospace, MITRE, MIT/LL, Sandia NL), University Affiliated Research Centers (John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory), military and government civilian members.  The MDSET has evolved into a high performance team that efficiently draws upon the distinct expertise provided by each community of members.  Individuals of the two SETA contracts, CSC and SPARTA, are distributed throughout the MDSET and are integral parts of integrated government, contractor, and FFRDC teams.  These individuals provide highly specialized services, are not separable from other parts of the MDSET by function, role or skill level, and cannot be replaced without severe disruption to ongoing work and the smooth functioning of the MDSET.  The proposed acquisition strategy allows for a phased replacement of MDSET SETA members by supported functional area at a logical break point in the system engineering product cycle that will coincide with a preplanned transfer of the government team members to Huntsville, AL. All MDSET companies and individuals are required to sign non-disclosure agreements.  Companies must also sign Organizational Conflict of Interest/Disclosure forms to ensure they are able to render impartial assistance to the agency without an unfair competitive advantage or impaired objectivity.

DESC: SPECIALIZED AUDIT DATA: The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Telcordia, 8 Corporate Place, Piscataway, NJ 08854-4157 for the acquisition of one specialized data product: CLONES (Common Language Online Entry System), for a base year with one option. CLONES is a real-time database that is the repository of CLLI (Common Language Location Identifier) codes.  CLLI codes identify the types, locations, and owners of telecommunications network equipment in the United States. This database is required in order that GAO may provide information on the overall state of facilities-based competition for special access services in the United States. CLONES data is updated on an as needed basis by those telecommunications companies who provide information on the location of their network equipment in CLONES. GAO believes that Telcordia’s CLONES data product described above is not offered by any other vendor; and because of that, GAO avoids a time consuming and substantial process in seeking other similar data which do not exist to GAO’s knowledge.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Global Positioning System Simulator System
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for a combined Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signal generator and GPS jammer/spoofer signal simulator for testing GPS receivers and receiver/antenna combinations to evaluate the receiver anti-jam/anti-spoofer performance in realistic signal environments.  

Two (2) testing configurations are envisioned.  Configuration 1 uses a direct injection set-up, in which a composite GPS signal comprised of a satellite-jammer-receiver scenario is connected directly into the GPS receiver, by-passing the antenna.  This set-up will exercise the internal receiver signal processing functions which have been designed to work in stressing signal environments.  Configuration 2 will incorporate individual signal generator outputs for multiple satellites and multiple jammer signals radiated from various locations into an anechoic chamber.  This configuration will spatially simulate a satellite constellation and jammer scenario in which a GPS receiver is located and connected to a Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) type of antenna. This set-up will not only exercise the receiver internal anti-jam processing, but also the anti-jam capability of the antenna. This configuration will also require, as outputs from the GPS signal simulator, control signals which can be integrated to a rate table on which the CRPA antenna is mounted … to simulate attitude changes of the simulated vehicle platform.  Both configurations will require signal selection of L1/L2/L5 frequencies.  Code selections of C/A, L2C, P, and P(Y) codes are required, as well as Y-Code (Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)) and M-Code which includes (M-noise, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) M-code, and M-code-data sets). 

Sole source negotiations will be held with Spirent Federal Systems, Inc. (Spirent).  Spirent developed a GPS simulator which became the industry leader in this technical area.  Spirent also provides unique capabilities and experience from its sales of multiple units to DoD Laboratories.  Contract period of performance is estimated to be sixteen (16) weeks.

<SUBJECT>R -- Pilot Hazardous Substances Emergency  Events Surveillance (HSEES) systen study
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) in the amount of $55,000.00 to conduct a Pilot study of Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) System in India. The (HSEES) system in India conducts spatial and temporal distribution of hazardous-substances emergencies and describes the morbidity and mortality experienced by employees, responders, and the general public.  It also identifies the risk factors associated with the morbidity and mortality; and develops strategies to reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality. CDC believes that NIOH is the only organization that can meet the requirements of the order because NIOH is an institute of the Indian Council for Medical Research of the Government of India (GOI) with the responsibility to address environment and occupational issues including conducting epidemiological and toxicological studies. NIOH is the primary Indian Government Agency dealing with occupational and environmental health issues.  The Indian Government requires direct involvement of the appropriate GOI agency for implementation of a surveillance project of this type. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please send your documentation to Ronnie Francis at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or by e-mail to efi8@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to Negotiate and Award a Sole Source Contract
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau has a requirement for expert advice and assistance in planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects in support of the mission of the Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau is the premier source of information about the American people and the economy. More than just numbers, this information shapes important policy decisions that help improve the nation’s social and economic conditions.  The Census Bureau’s mission is built around large-scale surveys and censuses. Activities involve survey and questionnaire design, geographic infrastructure update, and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis help improve processes from data collection through dissemination.  Within the Census Bureau is the Computer Services Division (CSvD), the mission of which is to provide the Census Bureau and other customers with a world-class computer center using best practices and state-of-the-art technology to monitor systems, communications and applications. In addition, CSvD ensures the deliverance of expert systems administration services and the functionality of a stable, fault tolerant, and secure computing facility.  CSvD has the primary responsibility for planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects, and requires high level IT strategic and operational expertise beyond its inherent resources in order to effectively support the mission of the Census Bureau.  These services include the following:  (a) recommending and facilitating implementation of new initiatives to determine the impact on facilities management and disaster recovery activities; reviewing and evaluating administrative and technical IT operations, (c) designing and preparing materials and presentations for executive and client briefings and forums; (d) providing on-going expert consultation concerning the mission, direction and operations of the Computer Services Division (CSVD) and the Census Bureau Bowie Computer Center (BCC), (e) coordinating and managing the BCC major electrical and mechanical infrastructure upgrades with GSA and Census operations staff, and (f) making recommendations for such areas as streamlining efforts, problem solutions, and business practice reengineering and improvements.  The effectiveness of these services is highly dependent on the ability to project a thorough understanding and intimate knowledge of Census Bureau mission, programs, policies, priorities, strategic plans, and operations as well as the ability to develop and maintain effective relationships with executives and managers throughout the Census Bureau community in order to garner acceptance of viewpoints, influence decision-making, and garner support and cooperation for implementing recommendations and carrying out projects.  It is critically important to maintain continuity of ongoing initiatives, projects and other efforts, many of which are time-critical, in order to avert interruptions, delays, duplicative work, relearning, and excessive costs.  For the past five years, CSvD has obtained these services from Mr. James E. Steed of Waldorf, MD.  Mr. Steed has demonstrated the ability to satisfy the Government’s requirements as described above.  Based on the nature of the work and available information, Mr. Steed is considered the only source that can meet the Government’s requirement satisfactorily.  It is the Government’s intention to solicit and negotiate a contract for the requirement with Mr. Steed on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302.  The intended contract will have a period of performance of one year and will include four one-year option periods.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 14 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Contact should NOT be made regarding this notice to Sarah Annerton or the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.   The Military Health System (MHS) will sponsor an Industry Forum to conduct market research on innovative practices to reduce cost and improve the qu ality and timeliness of recapitalizing medical facility infrastructure.  This will include improvements made through both the Medical Military Construction (MILCON) and Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) processes.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation or a request for proposals.  This Industry Forum is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The results of this market research may result in a future synopsis announc ed in the FEDBIZ OPS as a request for proposal or request for quote.  Invitees include all interested and available vendors, Federal healthcare agencies, associations, trade groups, societies, and other private sector healthcare organizations capable of pr oviding applicable industry guidance and direction and are willing to share this information in an open forum benefiting the MHS infrastructure transformation process.  Those participating in this Industry Forum will help shape the tools to plan, acquire, and sustain facilities that support MHS goals of providing facility assets that balance the need for high quality medical care with the available resources provided by Congress.  The MHS facility infrastructure must be capable of rapidly adapting to the dy namic and increasingly complex health care market and changes in mission. Additionally, the significant impact of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 and its compressed implementation timelines compel a transformation of existing processes. The MHS mu st transform overall management of its portfolio of facility assets and seeks participants input on lessons learned and previous industry experience in the following areas:  1)Asset visibility:  Developing a systematic and strategic approach to provide co mprehensive visibility of its assets, to include the physical and functional condition of facilities and an enterprise-wide process to measure improvement in facility condition and performance resulting from expenditure of medical MILCON and Operation & Ma intenance (O&M) funds.  2) Linkage to strategic and business planning goals:  Establishing a process to directly link facility investments with performance goals articulated in strategic and business planning and enhances joint operations and interagency c ollaboration.  3) MILCON planning, acquisition and recapitalization:  Transforming the medical MILCON planning, acquisition and recapitalization processes in order to deliver medical facilities of appropriate quality in timeframes more responsive to market  needs and at lower cost.  Each year, the Department of Defense typically expends over $250 million in MILCON and $540 million in Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) funds to support an MHS infrastructure with a plant replacement value in exc ess of $20 billion. The MHS infrastructure includes a broad array of facility types, including those that provide direct health care services, training, as well as research and development.  This infrastructure faces constant challenges to maintain proper facility conditions and the optimal mix of capabilities. Market demands and missions constantly evolve and facility recapitalization and sustainment efforts in the MHS lag well behind accepted industry standards. As market and mission pressures increase, s o too does the competition for funding from other portions of the MHS. The challenge to wisely plan and execute facility investments has never been greater. The  current environment mandates transformation of the overall approach to planning, design, acquisition, and management of the full range of MHS facilities.  The anticipated value of this Industry Forum for the MHS and its participants includes:  1) Gaining an understanding of current practices used by the MHS to plan, acquire, and sustain health facility assets  2) Sharing examples and experiences about issues and challenges that must be addressed in order to formulate meaningful solutions  3) Discussing ide as, approaches and experiences that have been used by other Federal healthcare agencies and private sector healthcare systems with respect to examples of: *  Healthcare systems that have been through major recapitalization projects *  Capital investment de cision-making approaches  as they relate to linking strategy and business planning to facility development  *  Cost-effective and efficient planning processes from up front design to construction and post-occupancy *  Sharing ideas that may be instructive  to the MHS as it seeks solicitation of professional firms and organizations to assist in the transformation of the MHS infrastructure.  Attendees must register in accordance with the administrative instructions below.  Only those pre-registered will be al lowed access to the meeting due to base security requirements.  Administrative Information:  The Industry Forum will be held on 20 July, 2006 at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) Campus, Bethesda, Maryland.  The forum will st art promptly at 09:00 am and end at 5:00 pm Local Time.  Lunch will be available at USUHS.  To register for this conference, please refer to the link http://healthcare.mitretek.org/2006usuhsworkshop/ Registration will close on 17 July 2006.   To gain acces s to USUHS, participants must present a government-issued identification (e.g. valid drivers license).  Due to limited parking at USUHS, participants are encouraged to use Metro rail service. The Medical Center stop on Wisconsin Avenue is a short walk fro m the auditorium.  Directions can be found on the conference website.  This market survey is being conducted in accordance with the requirements mandated by FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, specifically under the policy set forth in FAR part  12.101.  The procedures for a Market Survey and subsequent review of the information obtained as a result of the RFI shall be conducted in accordance with FAR part 10.001, Market Research.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for  Mass Gauging Data Base per the following Statement of Work. Introduction NASA is currently developing the propulsion system concepts for exploration missions including a near term human return to the lunar surface and an eventual human mission to Mars. The propulsion concepts being investigated are considering the use of cryogenic propellants for the low gravity portion of the mission, that is, the upper stage for the earth orbit insertion and for the earth departure stage. These concepts will require the accurate, low gravity quantity gauging of the propellants stored in the propulsion tanks to assure adequate propellant inventory prior to beginning any human exploration mission. Presently an accurate, robust low gravity quantity gauging system for cryogenic propellants does not exist. NASA has begun a technology program to develop this gauging system to a TRL of 6, through a government in-house ground test program of two promising schemes and has released an RFP for the development of additional gauging systems.  Objective Cryogenically fueled launch vehicles have used and are using techniques to measure the propellant quantity in their propellant tanks during ascent, under settled conditions or during short coast missions. The objective of this SOW is to perform a study to identify and list all of the known, existing propellant gauging techniques. Task Description Develop a data base to identify and list all past and current propellant tank mass gauging techniques employed on cryogenically fueled launch vehicles, upper stages and satellites. The data base should include as a minimum the following launch systems: Delta 3/4, Atlas 2/3/4/5, Arianne 4/5, H-3, and Russian launch vehicles, Saturn S IVB and the STS External Tank. If possible, identify future mass gauging development work (IRAD) currently underway by the launch system suppliers.  Task Format  The required format for each application is the following: 	Technique 	Application 	Dates Employed 	Low-gravity Mission 	Propellant Conditions •	Fluid •	Quantity to be gauged •	Fluid state •	Bond number Gauging Frequency Uncertainty of Measurement Reliability References Add to the data base the ESA flight experiment technique and results and the USAF SOTVSE planned gauging experiment. Deliverable Report of the mass gauging currently and previously used by the launch systems described in the Task Description and in the Task Format sections above. Period of Performance A draft version of the report as denoted in the Deliverable section must be submitted for NASA GRC review two months after contract award. The final version of the report must be submitted one month after the completion of the NASA GRC review. The NASA GRC review will not exceed two weeks. The contract key personnel shall participate via telecom during the NASA GRC review.  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-08.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions from industry regarding clarifications of the requirements as follows:

1) Shutter:   The solicitation states: "Camera must include an integrated shutter, or be compatible with an industry standard shutter"
 
QUESTION:   
There are many different industry shutters with a variety of fixturing and attachment methods.   In addition, the type of shutter supplied depends upon the performance level required; that performance includes extinction, opening and closing time, minimum and maximum exposure time, duty cycle, and clear aperture.   

ANSWER:
The shutter shall provide perfect extinction, and open and close in less than 5 ms.  The duty cycle of the shutter shall match the rate at which the camera can acquire and readout images.  The clear aperture shall be the smallest aperture that does not block the field of view of the CCD.  

If a shutter is not integrated into the camera, then the camera supplier shall provide the specific shutter model and manufacturer that both fulfills the requirements specified, and is compatible with the camera.  Moreover any shutter not provided will add cost, which shall be included in overall "value" of the bid.


 2) Frame Transfer.   The solicitation states: "require a "frame transfer" camera which allow for 2 images within 2 ms."    

QUESTION:
Does this mean that the camera must be ready to initiate an image within 2 ms of the end of the integration period of the previous image?   Does the camera only have to meet this for two images, i.e. in a 'burst' mode?

ANSWER:
The camera needs to be triggerable twice in 2 ms. I.e., if the integration time is 50 us (typical) then NIST will expose for 50 us, transfer the frame to the masked region of the CCD and expose again 2 ms later.  Then each frame will be readout in a typical 300 ms, before any more images would be requested.


3) Noise.  The solicitation states: " CCD readout noise - require a readout noise at or below 5 electrons.  System readout noise - at or below 10 electrons."    

QUESTION:
Readout noise is a function of readout rate.   Is there a readout rate or time that is required?   Total system noise includes dark noise, which is a function of exposure time, readout time and camera temperature.    Is there a typical exposure time that may be assumed to allow us to calculate dark noise?

ANSWER:
A readout rate of 1 MHz on a 512x512 CCD is acceptable.  Faster is better, within the noise requirements.  The typical exposure time will be 50-500 microseconds.  Dark current will doubtless be irrelevant.


4) Kinetics mode.  The solicitation states:  “Strongest consideration will be given to the Offeror whose quote can provide devices that can support kinetics mode in addition to frame transfer."   

QUESTION:
What is meant by 'kinetics mode'?

ANSWER:
If only a fraction of the CCD is illuminated (for example, 10 pixels), then kinetics mode shall be the ability to integrate for some time, then shuffle the image down by those 10 rows (typically in 10s of microseconds), expose again (the initial 10 pixels would be in the dark), and etc, until the whole CCD is filled with a series of "strips" of data.  This is commonly used to image the time dependence of an object on a very rapid time scale.  10 pixels are intended as an example, not a requirement.


All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation amendment is to clarify a requirement of the solicitation. The requirement reads "All work shall be performed by a Caterpillar factory trained service tecnician only." To clarify this sentence, the technician or technicians performing service on SSA's generators may have training/knowledge/expertise in servicing other brand generators such as Koehler and Cummins, etc. however, their training/knowledge/expertise must include specific training/knowledge/expertise in Caterpillar generators as well. This Caterpillar brand training/knowledge/expertise is critical because the 3 SSA Caterpillar generators are required to start the 3 SSA Solar Titan turbine generators which supply emergency power to the SSA National Computer Center (NCC), the SSA NCC Utility Building and SSA Headquarters complex all in Woodlawn, MD. If at any time these 3 Caterpillar 3412 diesel generators fial to start the Solar Titan turbine generators, critical computer loads could be lost, which would have a catastrophic effect on the nationwide operation of the SSA.  Accordingly, the due date and time for SSA's receipt of quotations remains unchanged at 3:00 p.m., local prevailing time, on Thursday, July 20, 2006.
