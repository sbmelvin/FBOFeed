<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1. SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide DOL's Veteran's Employment and Training Service (VETS) to (a) identify firms with the necessary experience and practical knowledge of Electronic Case Management and (b) obtain explicit information, by example, of how a prospective firm will provide value in the integration and deployment as well as operations and maintenance of a system for a future solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="COLOR: black">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 4301-4335 (USERRA), was signed into law on October 13, 1994.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USERRA prohibits discrimination in employment based on an individual's:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>prior service in the uniformed services; current obligations as a member of the uniformed services; or, intent to join the uniformed services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An employer is prohibited from discriminating against a person because of such person's attempt to enforce his or her rights under the Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an individual who has testified or otherwise assisted in any proceeding under the Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USERRA also provides reemployment rights with the pre-service employer following qualifying service in the uniformed services. USERRA applies to private employers, the Federal Government, and State and local governments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also applies to United States employers operating overseas.</span></p>
<p>VETS investigates claims made by individuals alleging that their USERRA rights have been violated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If resolution cannot be achieved following an investigation, the claimant may have his or her claim referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for consideration of representation in the appropriate District Court. Federal employees may have their claims referred to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) for consideration of representation before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">To improve and facilitate its provision of these services to its customers, the VETS organization recognizes the performance gap that exists. VETS is required by &sect; 4332(c) to coordinate with the Department of Defense (DoD), DOJ and OSC, to ensure that "each have electronic access to the case files". The current system, UIMS (USERRA Information Management System), is an electronic information management system, but does not provide for electronic case files or fully electronic case management. To comply with the law and to enhance its services, VETS is seeking a replacement electronic management solution.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">4. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Case Management Requirement</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
<p>The delivered solution shall be an Electronic Case Management Application that will support and<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN"> coordinate the collaboration, negotiation, arbitration, referral and litigation activities performed by DOL and its federal partners in their respective USERRA responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The application must permit upload, download, creation, image-to-text transformation, editing, management, searching, role-based sharing, publishing, reporting and archiving of electronic documents and document redaction, across a variety of digital media including: electronic text, Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images, searchable-PDF, digitized hardcopy documents, redacted documents, photographs, as a minimum. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3.

These wells would be tied into the existing and or planned water supply distribution system(s). Pilot borings would be required up to 1,500 feet (ft) below ground surface or deeper to identify confined aquifers.  Contractor would have to record results of the test bore drilling, visual logging, classification, geophysical logging, mud properties, and drill rig parameters to be used by the contractor to design, construct, develop and test each well to maximize groundwater production from the deep aquifer(s) in the best water producing zone(s). Well construction, water quality analysis to World Health Organization standards, and pump selection, installation, and surface completions would be in accordance with industry standards for public water supply wells.  Drill rigs should be capable of both mud and air rotary drilling as bedrock will likely be encountered at some locations.  Contractor would be required to provide all materials and equipment necessary to complete and put the well into operation including electrical equipment. High grade stainless steel wire wrap well screen or open borehole completions may be necessary or desired depending on geologic conditions.  Any unconfined aquifer or potentially contaminated aquifers would be hydraulically isolated from the deep confined aquifer(s). <BR><BR>All interested contractors shall provide their capability statement via email to Mr. Adrian Gavins at adrian.o.gavins@usace.army.mil by 6 September 2010 at 5:00 PM, Afghanistan Time.<BR><BR>

accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and
remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this

(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or
division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the
responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its
intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of
subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the
responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient
documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this
clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the
absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment"
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 	(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual
confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423
or 269-961-5757.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
IOWA CITY, IOWA #636A8
JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME REQUIREMENT


JUSTIFICATION


In accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.302-1, 6.303, and 6.304, I submit the following justifications:

1.	The action being approved is a proposed acquisition of the Censis Censitrac instrument tracking system as a brand name product, in accordance with VAAR 852.236-90 - Restriction on Submission and Use of Equal Products, within solicitation VA-263-10-RQ-0469, for project, "Instrument Tracking System," for the VISN 23 medical centers.

2.	VISN 23 is procuring an instrument tracking system to be used in the SPD departments, as well as other departments in the medical centers including the Operating Room environment.  
 
3.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), and 38 U.S.C. 8109(b) and VAAR 806.3.

4.	VISN 23 currently has Steris sterilizers throughout the medical centers.  Any new equipment must be able to tie-in to the existing equipment.

5.	The Request for Quote (RFQ) for the "Instrument Tracking System" containing this requirement shall be posted on GSA's e-Buy website as well as this J&A IAW FAR 5.102(a)(6).

6.	It is determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

7.	Market research and Engineer's personal experience determined that there are no other systems compatible that meets VISN 23's requirement to electronically interface with the existing Steris sterilizers to electronically track sterilization loads, including sets being flashed, and automate the process for archiving the sterilization records. 

8.	There are currently no specifications for this requirement that would facilitate full and open competition as the manufacturer's particular brand name product and features are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products will not meet the agency's needs. 

9.	There are no sources that have expressed a written interest in this acquisition.

APPROVAL

Based on the foregoing findings, I hereby determine, within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1 and in accordance with VAAR 806.304 and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 that:

a.	It is in the best interest of VISN 23 to acquire the Censis Censitrac instrument tracking system as a brand name product, in accordance with VAAR 852.236-90 - Restriction on Submission and Use of Equal Products, within solicitation VA-263-10-RQ-0469, for project, "Instrument Tracking System," for the VISN 23 medical centers.

Upon the basis of these justifications, I hereby authorize the sole source solicitation for this procurement and by signing this document certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
