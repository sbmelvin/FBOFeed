<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Advanced Projects Division, Advanced Program Branch, Eglin AFB, FL 32542 intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin for Subminiature Flight Safety System (SFSS) Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-Off Missile (JASSM) Integration and Flight Test Demonstration.
<p>The goal of the SFSS program is to develop and demonstrate a universal, subminiature, warhead compatible, flight safety system. The proposed weapon system, JASSM, has been selected as the test demonstration platform for the SFSS program. The primary purpose of the subject contract is to provide JASSM integration support to the Subminiature Flight Safety System, which is being concurrently developed under a separate contract. By integrating the SFSS into the JASSM, demonstrations can be accomplished to prove out the SFSS design. The overall object of the subject effort is to complete all activities necessary to design, develop, and qualify an SFSS demonstration unit via ground, captive-carry, and flight test demonstration activity in the JASSM weapon system. The SFSS demonstration unit will be qualified in multiple configurations in a laboratory environment to demonstrate potential SFSS capabilities with other weapons in their flight test environments before being integrated into the JASSM platform. Work to be performed encompasses design, development, test, and flight test associated with weapon system level certification. Lockheed Martin has proprietary knowledge of the weapon system mandated for demonstration and extensive integration experience with the full spectrum of technologies associated with integration, qualification, and test of weapon safety systems, and associated telemetry applications.</p>

<DESC><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice for Solicitation 2012-N-14299
<p><br />Project Title: "MAI Project to Evaluate Hierarchical Online and Text Messages for Black and Latino MSM"</p>
<p><br />1. Introduction. This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for a Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541720 "Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities", with a small business size standard of $7 Million. When released the solicitation number will be 2012-N-14277. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about May 15, 2012. Request for Proposals will not be provided to interested parties in hard copy form. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for the release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>2. Overview: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), Prevention Research Branch (PRB), is contemplating a single award two year for this project.</p>
<p>3. Purpose: The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical messages regarding multiple prevention options (via online and text messaging) in potentially reducing HIV transmission risk, and to determine the relative effectiveness of hierarchical messages compared to a single "condom only" message. Tailored messages will be tested for black and Latino MSM who are HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative (i.e., unprotected anal sex with a non-primary partner in the past 6 months), and low-risk HIV-negative (i.e., other MSM besides high-risk). A secondary goal is to determine whether specific hierarchical messages and "condom only" message effectiveness - and any differential main effects between message types (hierarchical vs. condom only) -- are moderated by race/ethnicity (i.e., black, Latino) and other demographic variables (e.g., geographical location, age group) for each of the three HIV-status groups.</p>
<p>4. Objectives: The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical messages regarding multiple prevention options in potentially reducing HIV transmission risk, and to determine the relative effectiveness of hierarchical messages compared to a single "condom only" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />5. Background for the Acquisition. Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to have very high incidence of HIV infection in the United States - particularly black MSM (Prejean, 2011), and new approaches are needed to effectively reach and reduce HIV risk behavior of minority MSM. For 30 years, condoms have been the only effective physical intervention for reducing HIV infection risk, and thus the single "gold standard" message available to sexually-active MSM for protecting themselves and their partners.</p>
<p>Recently, multiple biomedical intervention options have become available. Results have been presented for partial efficacy of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-retroviral (ARV) medications (Grant 2010), and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is already available in emergency situations. Although there are serious concerns about access to PrEP for many people, recent studies have found that minority (vs. white) MSM were more likely to use (by HIV-negative MSM) and share with sex partners (by HIV-positive MSM) non-prescribed PrEP and PEP several years before known efficacy (Mansergh 2010). Further, minority (vs. white) MSM were more willing to use a less efficacious PrEP product in order to avoid using condoms (Koblin 2011), and more willing to use PrEP even after PrEP efficacy results were known (Sullivan 2011). PrEP and PEP are likely to be prescribed only to HIV-negative MSM at highest risk for HIV transmission (by HIV-positives) and infection (by currently risky HIV-negatives). Even if PrEP access is not an issue, other biomedical interventions may not be too far in the future (e.g., topical ARV gels). Some studies (Marks 2010) have suggested that behavioral "seroadaptative" approaches may be an effective alternative for some - especially HIV-positive MSM. The relatively heightened willingness among some racial/ethnic minority MSM to use alternative products, and perhaps other HIV prevention intervention approaches, needs to be further understood. To help accomplish this, effective hierarchical messages should be developed for multiple prevention options of varying levels of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Little research has been conducted on the effects of focused hierarchical messaging in HIV prevention beyond single messaging of condom use. However, a study of hierarchical (vs. male condom only) messages for young black and Latino women found that women who received the hierarchical message (i.e., use male condoms; if not use female condoms...) were less likely to report that male condoms were effective in reducing HIV infection (Miller 2004). Adding a second option to an existing established option can potentially impact perceptions about and intentions to use various prevention options in the future.</p>
<p>Are there communication approaches to maximize HIV infection risk reduction in a world of multiple effective options? We are now entering an era of multiple prevention options (Shattock 2011) -- including PrEP, PEP, a topical ARV gel, or HIV seroadaptive behaviors (e.g., behavioral decisions based on viral load and anal sex position) -- and we need to prepare for disseminating simple and effective public health messages that clearly present these options. Differential hierarchical message options are likely to apply to HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative, and low-risk HIV-negative MSM. Implications of the findings of this study may apply to a variety of public health actions, from fact sheets to social marketing campaigns to federal guidelines, and may inform messaging within behavioral interventions currently implemented in communities of black and Latino MSM, as well as other populations. Lastly, text messaging has demonstrated promise as an intervention approach for high-risk MSM (Reback 2011), but is it differentially effective compared to online messaging of risk information? <br /><br />This proposal is aligned with the following NHAS goal and DHAP Strategic Plan as they relate to black and Latino MSM: Goal 1. Reducing New HIV Infections and related; Step 2. Expand targeted efforts to prevent HIV infection using a combination of effective, evidence-based approaches (2.1. Design and evaluate innovative prevention strategies and combination approaches for preventing HIV in high-risk communities; and 2.4. Expand prevention with HIV-positive individuals.).</p>

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Leland Stanford Junior University School (Stanford University), 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, California, 94305-2004.
<p><br />The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 6.302-1. The NAICS code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). The objective of this project is to evaluate completeness of the National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry (ALS Registry). The vendor will perform capture-recapture analysis on 2001-2005 data in the ALS Registry using datasets from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the National Health Index (NDI). The vendor will need to have personnel capable of independently reviewing thousands of electronic medical documents, analyzing them for significant neuroepidemiological data, and then conducting capture-recapture statistical analysis of the relevant data.</p>
<p>Stanford University is the only responsible source capable of performing this capture-recapture analysis. Neuroepidemiology is a highly-specialized field; there are only a few neuroepidemiologists in the United States who could effectively analyze the necessary electronic medical documents. There are even fewer neuroepidemiologists with the ability to conduct capture-recapture statistical analysis. Stanford's unique ability to provide faculty with both neuroepidemiological expertise and statistical expertise combined in the same person is critical to this project because an attempt at a division of labor would not only be grossly inefficient given the massive numbers of medical records involved, but even more problematically, could lead to errors in the statistical analysis itself. In addition, Stanford University has some of the world's leading experts on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis research available for consultation and collaboration if necessary. Stanford University also has a familiarity with the United States health care system and experience using all of the National datasets necessary for this analysis, including, the ALS Registry, CMS, VBA, and NDI datasets. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Stanford University. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd VIA EMAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-14487 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN May 15, 2012.

<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-05-C-00007

<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, 202-493-5940

<a href="mailto:dixie.harper@faa.gov">dixie.harper@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) Paragraph 3.2.2.4 (Single-Source Selection), the FAA proposes to extend the FAA Interim Voice Switch Replacement (IVSR) contract, DTFAWA-05-C-00007, with Frequentis USA, Columbia, Maryland.
The proposed contract extension will be six months for the period of May 30, 2012 through November 29, 2012.  This single-source extension is estimated to have a value of $1.78 million, $1.0 million for hardware and $780K for administrative costs, (e.g., program management, documentation updates, training conduct, non-recurring engineering support, contractor depot logistics support).
Awarding a contract extension to the incumbent will enable the FAA to bridge the gap between the end (May 29, 2012) of the current contract and the award of a new competitive contract (October 2012) and to continue procuring and installing systems in new air traffic control towers (ATCT); replacing voice switches that have reached the end of their useful service life; and, providing contractor maintenance support for systems already installed.  
The rationale to extend IVSR is based upon the need for standardization, and Frequentis USA being the only source available to satisfy the interim requirements in the required time frame.
The FAA has determined that a single-source extension to the existing IVSR contract provides the best value and most timely response to the FAA's existing Terminal Voice Switch Replacement (TVSR) requirements.
Questions concerning this announcement can be submitted in writing to Whitney Coleman-Clark, AJA-472, E-Mail:  whitney.coleman-clark@faa.gov.  Questions must be submitted by May 8, 2012 to be considered.

<RESPDATE>051512
<ARCHDATE>06142012
<CONTACT>Rebecca KRUSE
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This pre-solicitation notice is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.204. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), on behalf of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Quieting Technologies for Reducing Noise during Seismic Surveying and Pile Driving. The BSEE Acquisition Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate. The applicable NAICS Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 18 months.
BACKGROUND: The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and supporting regulations, necessitates studies to assess environmental impacts from activities authorized and permitted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).  This effort will provide a thorough examination of potential alternative technologies to traditional airgun use (e.g., alterations to airguns or implementation of non-conventional sound sources) and quieting technologies for pile driving and associated vessels to gain a better understanding of the acoustic characteristics of the technologies including sound propagation, their operational requirements, limitations to their use, potential impacts on the environment, and any further steps and time needed for their development.  An additional comparison of the quality and economic value of the data collected using these alternative sound sources to those from current acoustic sources will also be completed. Ultimately, this will provide BOEM and other regulatory agencies with information needed to determine the usefulness and appropriateness of these alternative and quieting technologies for a variety of mitigation and monitoring situations and will be subsumed into BOEM compliance efforts related to the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Management Act, and other statutes.
SCOPE OF WORK: The study is expected to: (1) Review and examine recent developments (existing, emerging and potential) in alternative acoustic technologies for seismic surveying (other than traditional airgun use), whether proposed or in development, (2) Review and examine developments (existing, emerging and potential) in quieting technologies for pile driving during offshore renewable energy activities, (3) Review and examine developments (existing, emerging and potential) in quieting technologies for vessel noise associated with OCS energy development activities, (4) Identify the requirements for operation and limitation to use for these technologies, (5) Evaluate data quality and cost-effectiveness of these technologies as compared to that from existing marine acoustic technologies, (6) Identify the acoustic characteristics of new technologies in varying environments and compare to that from existing technologies, (7) Examine potential environmental impacts from these technologies,  (8) Identify which technologies, if any, provide the most promise for full or partial  traditional use and specify the conditions which might warrant their use (e.g., specific limitations to water depth, use in Marine Protected Areas), and (9) Identify next steps, if appropriate, for the further development of these technologies, including potential incentives for field testing.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT: If your organization is interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organization's name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and DUNS Number via email to Rebecca.Kruse@bsee.gov at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Herndon, VA by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDST) on May 15, 2012.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. M12PS00025 on all correspondence.  Inquiries shall be submitted in writing to the email address referenced above.

<DESC><p>As part of its mission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), on behalf of the Department of Transportation (DOT), issues corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for manufacturers of passenger cars and light duty trucks and fuel efficiency standards for manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles fuel under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA).</p>
<p>Description<br />Directed by these two Acts, the DOT is required to consider and evaluate the many aspects and impacts associated with the regulation of industries which have such a substantial impact on the economy of the United States; examples of which include technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy and fuel efficiency, and the need of the United States to conserve energy to issue standards that are considered the "maximum feasible" within such, or similar, constraints. To develop and issue these significant, and in some cases historic, regulations, the agency contracts significant research, computer modeling, and analyses with organizations outside the agency including government and non-government entities along with conducting its own internal efforts. It is therefore critical that throughout the development and issuance, the agency's regulatory documents are supported by well-established economical and technical principles and that the supporting materials be formally reviewed by respected and established subject matter experts for these regulated industries; a process also commonly known as the peer review.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this contract is to establish a contract with an independent organization which has a track record of and continuing ability to organize, manage and conclude yet to be determined peer reviews of vehicle fuel economy and fuel efficiency research, computer models, and analyses for fiscal years 2012-2016.</p>

It is the Government's intent to award a Time and Material Labor Hour type contract resulting from the solicitation, with or without discussions, to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted. The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about May 28, 2012.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Base period of twelve (12) months plus four (4) one (1) year option periods for a total of five (5) years.</p>

The Compost Brewer features an extractor dome- this maximizes the extraction of organisms from the compost into the water to provide inoculated soils with a more beneficial microbial life which provides a better growing medium for plant material. The compost brewer's has a positive displacement Sweetwater pumps which does not force microbes through pump augers or centrifugal pumps. It uses stainless steel tubing throughout to help produce a more sustainable life cycle.  Since this unit is 100% air driven there are no air stone filters that the water is driven through that can degrades the production of microbes and fungi. The unit is compact enough to fit between the wheel wells of a pickup truck so it is transportable to be use between several parks.

<SUBJECT>M--Extension of ordering period to current Production Support Services contract in support of Fleet Readiness Center Southeast
<SOLNBR>N6134012R0054
<CONTACT>Kathleen Dougherty 4073808189
<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division intends to issue a no-cost contract modification to current contract N68936-05-D-0042 with SoBran Corporation for Production Support Services in support of Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE).  This contract modification will extend the ordering period from 31 May 2012 through 28 February 2013.  The current ceiling will not be increased.  Services include providing transportation of aircraft components, managing warehouse operations, processing engine and component inductions, buildup and maintenance of tool boxes, performing inventories and production control, providing external support to the In-Service-Repair Program, operating and maintaining mega centers, providing environmental support and performing equipment management functions.
  The work is performed at FRCSE Naval Air Station Jacksonville, FL; Naval Station, Mayport, FL; Cecil Commerce Center (commercial facility) in Jacksonville, FL; FRCSE Jacksonville Detachment Oceana, VA; and F/A-18 In-Service Repair (ISR) facility at MCAS Beaufort, SC. 
This effort will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  6.302-1.  Award of this follow-on extension to any other source at this time would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The solicitation for the follow-on effort was issued on 6 March 2012 under solicitation N61340-12-R-0001.
  The duration of task orders issued against N68936-05-D-0042 resultant to this justification and approval will be commensurate with the progression of the folllow-on acquisition to ensure a transition of contractor provided Production Support Services away from the current contract as rapidly as practicable.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing they can fulfill the requirement of providing Production Support Services during this immediate time may submit a written response, which may be considered by the agency.  It must clearly show the firmâ€™s ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing programmatic hardship.
Written responses shall be submitted by e-mail to kathleen.dougherty@navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Nicholas E Sartain, Contract Specialist, Phone 870-543-7370, Email nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for assessing mRNA gene expression in rat liver.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies and other than small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from businesses capable of performing the assessment of mRNA gene expression changes in rat liver using Next-Generation sequencing technology (Next-Gen).</p>
<p>Next-Gen is required in order to provide full coverage of all the genes expressed in the rat livers after exposure to various hepatotoxicants. The Next-Gen platform that is required is the Illumina sequencing technology for continuity of results between projects. An estimated total of 324 samples will be analyzed to compare the effect of the different hepatotoxicants on the hepatic expression of the genes. Ultimately, the gene expression changes will be used as biomarkers of drug-induced liver injury. The government will provide total RNA to the contractor.</p>
<p>Performance requirements:<br />a. The contractor must independently assess the quantity and quality of the RNA provided by the government to ensure that it is acceptable for sequencing.<br />b. Preparation of libraries from the mRNA that can be run on the Next-Gen platform.<br />c. Sequencing of the libraries using Illumina sequencing technology. The parameters for the sequencing are paired end reads, 50 bases minimum per read, and a depth of coverage of at least 12 million read pairs per sample.<br />a) Alignment of the read data to the current reference human genome and transcriptome with transcript identifications assigned from the UCSC Known Gene table as the definition for both gene and transcript level expression, modified so that transcript IDs are guaranteed to be unique. At least 85% unambiguous alignment to the transcriptome and genome is required.<br />d. The following data analysis and output must be provided. The data will be provided on a portable hard drive of sufficient capacity to hold all the data (multiple hard drives may be used if the amount of data requires it).<br />1. FASTQ file for each sample. <br />2. A table of the flow cell statistics outlining the quality and yield of the flow cell(s) where samples were clustered and sequenced.<br />3. QC files regarding any presence of artifact/duplicate sequences, along with base distributions and qualities.<br />4. A tab-delimited text file with collapsed and normalized counts for each detected gene and isoform (UCSC Known Gene) for each specimen. <br />5. An alignment file (BAM format) containing best alignments of each read to the applicable genome.<br />6. De-multiplexing of Illumina barcodes, if applicable.<br />7. Reads aligned to Affymetrix probe sets on the HU133 2.0 Plus Array in a format compatible with an Affymetrix CEL file so that the data are compatible with and can be uploaded to the publicly-available software ArrayTrack (http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/BioinformaticsTools/Arraytrack/default.htm).</p>
<p><br />The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered instrument and components meet the technical requirements identified above.</p>
<p>Firms believing they can meet the requirements to the above specifications are encouraged to respond electronically with no less than the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address;<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products and services meet or exceed above specifications.<br />&bull; At a minimum provide the following:<br />All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service/product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement. Include the amount of total RNA required for each sample. <br />&bull; The offeror includes documentation of technical competency of the sequencing <br />&bull; Provide a list of prior similar experience in Next-Gen sequencing work and contact information on at least two references that can be contacted that the contractor has provided similar services within the last two years. Name, telephone number, email address, contract number and description of services with dollar amount. <br />&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.<br />&bull; Provide information if any of these specifications are too restrictive. No response will be considered that the listed specifications are adequate in a competitive environment. <br />&bull; If a large business, provide if subcontracting opportunities exist for small business concerns.<br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing must be submitted.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response. <br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 541380- Testing laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $12 million.</p>
<p>Interested Contractors must respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before May 8, 2012 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OA/OAGS, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502 or email nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov. Reference FDA1102348.</p>
<p>Notice of Intent<br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not any future requirement similar to this one should be set aside for small business, made available to full and open competition or procure through sole-source acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>This Market Survey is being conducted to determine the size and type of businesses able to provide the services required under a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to support the Lakewood Major Acquisition Buying Office (MABO) of the Intermountain Region (IMR) of the National Park Service (NPS).
The MATOC is for construction only and design build services primarily for the Park Units in Colorado and Utah but may be used for the Park Units in Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  The NPS intends to award more than five (5) and up to seven (7) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts under this MATOC.  The IDIQ contracts will each have one base year and four option years and will compete amongst each other for all task orders.  The task orders will be for design/build or construction only services to repair or rehabilitate historic and nonhistoric structures in addition to a minimal amount of new construction for project types inclusive of but not limited to Site Utilities (gas, electric, communication), Site Improvements (trail, fence, grading, concrete work, landscaping, survey), Water & sewer, Roadway (bike, roadway, signage, striping), Fire & safety, Building exterior, Building interior, HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP), Sustainability (energy efficiency, renewables).  
The past task order project examples include renovations of historic and non historic maintenance shops, visitor centers and fee stations, upgrades to electrical, water and sewer systems, rehabilitation of fire suppression systems and safety systems, parking lot paving, HVAC rehabilitation, re-roofing, well drilling and lift stations, water, sewer and gas tank construction.  There may be minimal new construction of administrative building, comfort stations and vault toilets.  
The forecast of work is based on task order history described as follows:  Average task order price was $195K, the median task order price was $148K, the highest task order price was $765K (outlier), and the lowest task order price was $9K (outlier).  There was an average of 25 task orders per year competed among the IDIQ contract holders.  Only 2% of the task orders were for projects outside of Colorado and Utah.   The total task order contract awards per year were valued at $4M and 50% of the contract awards were made in July, August and September.  Based on history, the projects will mostly likely be performed in, but not limited to Rocky Mountain NP, Mesa Verde NP, Bryce Canyon NP, Dinosaur NM, Capital Reef NM, Arches NM, Canyonlands NM, Colorado NM, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Curecanti  NRA, Cedar Breaks NM, Great Sand Dunes NP&P, and Pipe Spring NM.  
The general applicable NAICS codes are 237110 and 236220 with small business size standards of $33.5M.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (USMC), is performing a market survey of current and developmental hybrid systems and components to play a role in informing future requirements in the area of efficient electric power generation and utilization for expeditionary forces.  By supporting this effort, you will be enabling the USMC to better define requirements for future acquisition decisions.  Information provided to NSWC PCD and the USMC will not be shared or distributed beyond other U.S government agencies without express written consent. It is desired that you fill out and return the attached form for each of your products relevant to this topic.
 

Description

For purposes of this market survey, MEHPS is any mobile/deployable power generation system that is capable of producing standard one and/or three phase electrical power in the standard voltages (110, 208, 240).  The MEHPS will deliver scalable automatic and autonomous load matching, solid state energy storage, and renewable energy integration capabilities that support the efficient and effective power matching for all elements of the MAGTF.  The MEHPS will be a scalable family of systems that efficiently match loads from 300W to 800 kW in bands of 300W to 5kW, 5kW to 60 kW and 60kW to 800kW. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) will support the integration of these capabilities into the family of USMC systems, with minor modification to current ground equipment Programs of Record (PORs), including tactical vehicles.
  The MEHPS can employ both hybrid and microgrid technologies. For the purposes of this announcement a hybrid system is a system composed of at least two integrated power generation sources, which may or may not include energy storage that distributes power from a centralized location. A microgrid is a smart distributed power generation network comprised of many sources of varying types, and an energy storage component which distributes power over a large area to many different levels of loads.  The primary areas of particular interest are power generation, power management, energy storage and power distribution.

Technologies of interest may be in the R&D phase of development, having a production horizon of five years with a TRL 6.
 The government will consider Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) on a case-by-case basis to protect proprietary R&D data disclosures.

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information, for planning purposes, regarding: (1) the availability and capability of potential sources that can provide the required services described below and (2) the size classification of the available and potential sources relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The NAICS code for this planned acquisition is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. Your response to the information requested will assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Congress established the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TTW) with the hope of increasing access to employment services for disability beneficiaries from a range of innovative providers. Under TTW, the Social Security Administration (SSA) provides beneficiaries with a Ticket akin to a voucher that they may use to obtain vocational rehabilitation, employment, or other support services from participating providers called Employment Networks. These providers receive payments from SSA if the beneficiaries they serve achieve successful employment outcomes. <br />To evaluate the TTW program, SSA needed data not available in SSA administrative records. Consequently, SSA developed the National Beneficiary Survey (NBS) to provide this information on representative samples of SSA beneficiaries receiving disability benefits.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to redesign and implement three new waves of the NBS <br />Under this project, the basic structure of the NBS will change modestly to collect fewer details on specific aspects of the TTW program, and more information on the factors associated with successful and unsuccessful work attempts.<br />See the attached draft SOW:</p>
<p>Response Information:<br />In order for SSA to asses a firm's capability, firms must submit a response that provides enough detail to indicate that it can provide the services that meet the requirements identified above.</p>
<p>SSA also seeks industry comment on the draft SOW. When submitting comments on the Draft SOW you need to identify the Section of the SOW your comment applies to such as:</p>
<p>Draft SOW Task 2, concerning kickoff meeting.</p>
<p>Comment: State your comment, questions, clarification, etc.</p>
<p><br />Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by SSA.</p>
<p>With your response, please include:</p>
<p>a. DUNS number<br />b. Company Name<br />c. Company Address<br />d. Current GSA Schedules appropriate to this notice<br />e. Type of Company (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged, women owned, HUBZone, and Service Disabled) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration<br />f. Company point of contact, phone and email address</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted in an electronic form via e-mail to the Contracting Officer at Christopher.Brennan@ssa.gov no later than May 7, 2012 at 12:00 pm. Reponses will not be accepted after the due date. Responses must not exceed twenty (20) pages. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 MB. Faxed information will not be considered. SSA will not accept phone calls regarding this notice.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:</p>
<p>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by SSA to award a contract. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with your submittal. SSA will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. Information received will be used in SSA's market research effort and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not to contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Reporting Responsibilities: </strong><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">The Interim REXO works under the general supervision of the USAID Mission Director for the mission in which <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>they are working - when assigned in the role of an Executive Officer, or under the general supervision of the RMSO Coordinator, who makes assignments in terms of broadly defined missions or functions, and provides only administrative and policy direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a recognized authority in a wide variety of typical Executive Officer functional areas, the incumbent has complete responsibility and authority to plan, design, schedule, and carry out major projects, studies, or other work independently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent typically exercises discretion and judgment in determining whether to broaden or narrow the scope of projects or studies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Completed work is reviewed primarily for potential influence on broad USAID and/or Mission policy and goals, fulfillment of objectives, or contribution to advancement of knowledge in the field, and is normally accepted without significant change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recommendations for new activities are usually evaluated only for such considerations as availability of funds and other resources, broad Agency goals, or Mission priorities.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Available Guidelines:</strong> &nbsp; <span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">Guidelines consist of broadly stated and nonspecific policy statements, statutes, court decisions, etc., that require extensive interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Guidelines are found in the FAM, FAR, ADS, AAPDS and other source documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent uses judgment and discretion in determining the intent of existing policy, and in interpreting and revising existing policy and regulatory guidance for use by others within or outside USAID and the Mission (e.g., other Executive Officers, technical subject-matter experts, USAID/Washington staffs, and host-country officials).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent is recognized as an authority in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on Mission support activities and administrative management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Exercise of Judgment:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Contractor must exercise sound and independent judgment in interpreting and applying USG and USAID-specific regulations and standard operating procedures in the course of carrying out the assigned duties.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Complexity:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The work includes broad functions and processes found in USAID Executive Offices worldwide, including a wide variety of duties requiring many different and unrelated processes and methods applied to a broad range of activities, or intensive analysis and problem-solving. Assignments are characterized by unusual breadth, and normally involve several phases of the work being pursued concurrently with support from within and outside the organization. Decisions regarding what needs to be done include largely undefined issues and elements, requiring extensive analysis to determine the nature and scope of problems encountered. The work requires the Interim REXO to establish new concepts, theories, or programs and considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Increasingly, this is also usually complicated by consolidation issues with the Department of State and involves ICASS service providers who do not fall under the Intermittent REXO's direct supervision. Intermittent REXOs need to be trained and comfortable using current Agency software such as CAJE, AVUE, E2i, BFEM, Phoenix, GLAAS, and EPICS.<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Scope and Effect:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The purpose of the work is to plan and carry out administrative management that is vital to USG interests in the country of assignment and in the Region.&nbsp;The work involves determining the soundness of Mission administrative management; developing and establishing new management approaches and methods for use by the Mission of assignment and/or Missions throughout the Region; resolving problems that are critical to accomplishment of important Agency objectives; providing authoritative advice and technical assistance to the Mission; or, developing or revising standards for use in developing and administering Mission management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Interim REXO's recommendations affect overall mission management that is essential to the long-term mission of the Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Nature, Level and Purpose of Contacts:&nbsp; </strong>The persons contacted include persons from outside USAID in a moderately unstructured setting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Typical of contacts at this level are those with persons in their capacities as contractors, attorneys, company executives, host-country officials, ICASS service providers or representatives of other USG Agencies, professional organizations, or organized or ad hoc groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This level may also include contacts with high-level Agency officials, several managerial levels removed from the employee, when such contacts occur on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose of Contacts: </strong>The purpose of contacts is to justify, defend, negotiate, or settle matters involving significant or controversial issues, often in situations where the people contacted have diverse viewpoints, goals, or objectives requiring the incumbent to achieve a common understanding of the problem and a satisfactory solution by convincing them, arriving at a compromise, or developing suitable alternatives. Typical of such contacts is negotiating important milestones or timetables; influencing or persuading others to use changed technologies about which there may be conflicting opinions; representing the Mission on highly sensitive and controversial topics; justifying the feasibility and desirability of plans or proposals that significantly affect Mission or host-government practices, negotiating consolidation plans with the StateDepartment, influencing the process of improved service as both alternative service providers&nbsp;or as customers to others who are providing the service, etc.<br /><span style="mso-bookmark: CL_QUALIFICAT"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><br /></span>REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:</span></strong></span>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.
<p>The USSOCOM is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) capability that will enable dismounted SOF to establish and to maintain a high throughput wireless network without relying on any existing fixed infrastructure. The MANET devices must be configured for man portable, fixed and airborne requirements and can operate in highly mobile environments. The system may operate in isolation, or may have gateways to and interface with a fixed network. In the latter operational mode, it is typically envisioned to operate as a "stub" network connecting to a fixed internetwork. Stub networks carry traffic originating at and/or destined for internal nodes, but does not automatically permit exogenous traffic to "transit" through the stub network. ... MANET nodes are equipped with wireless transmitters and receivers using antennas which may be omni-directional (broadcast), highly-directional (point-to-point), possibly steerable, or some combination thereof. At a given point in time, depending on the nodes' positions and their transmitter and receiver coverage patterns, transmission power levels and co-channel interference levels, a wireless connectivity in the form of a random, multi-hop graph or "ad hoc" network exists between the nodes. This ad hoc topology may change with time as the nodes move or adjust their transmission and reception parameters.</p>
<p>The overall goal of USSOCOM's mobile ad hoc networking is to extend mobility into the realm of autonomous, mobile, wireless domains, where a set of nodes that may be combined routers that form the network routing infrastructure in an ad hoc fashion. SOF requires a capability for persistent information and intelligence collection during all phases of combat operations. SOF lacks the capability to quickly transmit ISR data among deployed tactical teams. Thus, critical information is not reaching decision makers in near real time and as such don't have access to actionable information when needed. There are three elements needed to provide such capabilities they include a man-portable device, one for use on platforms and a directional antenna system to extend the MANET capability from team to team and deployed headquarters element.</p>
<p>The man portable device must be lightweight, include an integrated GPS receiver and must be modular-like so it can be adaptable for at least four different frequency configurations, including the Public Safety Band (4.9 GHz). The unit must be able to operate from an integral rechargeable and non-rechargeable commercial batteries (e.g., AA Batteries), providing at least 8 hours of operation and external batteries such as the BA-5590, BA-2590 and their rechargeable variants. Such external batteries must provide at least 36 hours of continuous operation from a fully charged battery. The internal router must contain a Mil-Spec IP67 rated Ethernet port for connecting various mobile computing devices, e.g., laptop or tablet. The proposed system will come with a battery eliminator so it can operate off of platform power from which it is being operated. The system's battery will be maintained fully charged when the system is being operated from platform power. <br />The Airborne device may be the same as the man portable device but additional channels are desired. It must be operated from platform power and be able to enter into the ground mobile network. It will be a client in the network but will primarily serve as a relay device supporting range extension. This device must participate in the same MANET without impact on the performance of the network. More than one integral wireless radio is desired so it can participate in the network providing simultaneous backhaul and connectivity and self-configuring routing to network members. The radio's router should be capable of forwarding up to 30 Mbps of TCP throughput and should be able to provide at least single hop backhaul simultaneously with connectivity to member devices. The Fixed/Ground Mobile device shall be comparable to the airborne device in electronic performance but shall include a tracking directional antenna system that will maintain connectivity with the airborne device mounted in a manned or unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The tracking antenna system will provide the necessary frequencies/power/gain to support up to 30 Mbps throughput. SWaP is of importance as it is for all the other aforementioned requirements an thus the entire system should not weigh more than 80 lbs when configured for transport, capable of low temperature operations (-30 to +45 C) without compromise of metal components when subjected to cold temperatures. The following architectural view represents one scenario for which this capability will be employed.</p>
<p>Respondents should address the following criteria in their submission:</p>
<p>Tx/Rx Frequency Range<br />Battery life<br />Bandwidth and associated throughput (Mbps)<br />Ease of Setup<br />Ease of Operation<br />Form factor/SWaP<br />Antenna Gain (EIRP) for both handheld receiver and tracking antenna<br />Network Architecture (Full Mesh)<br />Encryption capability (include any NSA approvals/certifications) <br />Integrated GPS<br />Provide Quality of Service (QoS) capability: priorities and bandwidth control<br />Manual override of channel and power assignment<br />Operate in environments from open sea to urban.<br />Data at Rest</p>
<p>Once industry information is received detailing potential technologically mature capabilities, USSOCOM may publish a follow-on synopsis requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall respond, within 30 days after release of this RFI, with existing or near-term mature capabilities or products that meet all or a subset of the aforementioned attributes. Reponses that include information detailing potential tradeoffs or alternative solutions is encouraged.</p>
<p>Program and technical point of contact is Mr. Mark Spadaro, 813-826-7263; email spadarom@socom.mil.</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). An RFP may be posted on Fed Biz Ops at some future time. However, the Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit Juneau, Alaska is conducting a market survey to determine if potential small business sources are available and capable for the Taxiway A Repaving at U.

It is 80 feet wide and consists of approximately 7" of concrete with an existing overlay of 2 to 10 inches of asphalt. The asphalt surface has been evaluated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and determined to be in poor condition. Some portions of the concrete underlayment are in poor condition. Taxiway striping will also be part of the project to meet FAA requirements. Striping will also be required on both sides of two adjacent roads and for walkways that cross the taxiway at both roadways. Testing in the specifications will be required to be performed by the contractor and a quality control/quality assurance plan will also be part of the project requirements. Elevation transitions for the Apron and Runway will be required for comfortable travel of both C-130 aircraft and for HH-60 and MH-65 helicopters at typical taxiway speeds. All work is required in support of the USCG Base Support Unit (BSU) Kodiak Island, Alaska. The total estimated value of the acquisition would be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make multiple project awards to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The anticipated research area for which project proposals will be sought is the Cost Benefit Analysis of Manned vs. Unmanned Systems. The Request for Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RPP18) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium. For information on the Robotics Technology Consortium and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://www.roboticstechc.org/.

Checklist identifies 87 separate tasks in 9 category areas from Performance Work Statement  which will be evaluated Pass, Fail, or Not Applicable. Not Applicable tasks are those under the PWS that were not performed or evaluated by the QAR during a monthly rating period. An area for comments under each task allows QAR to record specific reasons for any Fail rating.<br><br>3. Surveillance method will be annotated as either Random Sampling (RS) or 100% Inspection (IN) as is the case by task evaluated during the month.<br><br>4. Those tasks rated Not Applicable for any given month will not factor into evaluation metrics.<br><br>5. Metric 1. Fail to Pass Ratio. Total number of Fail rated tasks will be divided by total number of Pass rated tasks expressed in % terms rounded up. For example if there are 80 Pass rated tasks, 5 Fail rated tasks, and 2 Not Applicable rated tasks, the Fail/Pass ratio would be 5 Fails divided by 80 Passes (5/80) which =  0.0625 but through rounding up would be expressed as 7%.<br>STANDARD: No SSA rating may exceed 15%, i.e. rating of 16% or higher would be a performance failure.<br><br>6. Metric 2. Multiple Same Task, Same SSA Failures. This metric provides emphasis on not repeating a fail on the same task in the same SSA more than two monthly rating periods consecutively. This serves to ensure awarded Contractor has opportunity to address any training shortfalls with individual employees contributing to the fail, or failing to achieve training objective, to replace non-performing employees. STANDARD: any given task shall not be rated Fail more than two consecutive rating periods at the same SSA. <br><br><br>PART 2 - *TECHNICAL EXHIBIT 2<br><br>PBUSE Operations Performance Requirements Summary<br><br>1.Contractor Performance will be evaluated monthly at each identified command  using QAR Inspection Checklist & Contracting Officer Data Report - PBUSE as found in the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). While commands may have multiple geographical locations or units to which personnel are assigned, intent is that a single overall Rating will be provided per major unit, and a unit QAR will be assigned to collect individual site QAR data into a rolled report. Unit QAR will maintain site QARs if applicable with rolled report as supporting document.<br>  <br>2. Checklist identifies 38 separate tasks in 7 of 8 category areas from Performance Work Statement which will be evaluated Pass, Fail, or Not Applicable. Tasks in category "As Required" are covered sufficiently in other tasks  performed to not require addition on the QA Checklist.  Not Applicable tasks are those under the PWS that were not performed or evaluated by the QAR during a monthly rating period. An area for comments under each task allows QAR to record specific reasons for any Fail rating.<br><br>3. Surveillance method will be annotated as either Random Sampling (RS) or 100% Inspection (IN) as is the case by task evaluated during the month.<br><br>4. Those tasks rated Not Applicable for any given month will not factor into evaluation metrics.<br><br>5. Metric 1. Fail to Pass Ratio. Total number of Fail rated tasks will be divided by total number of Pass rated tasks expressed in % terms rounded up. For example if there are 31 Pass rated tasks, 3 Fail rated tasks, and 3 Not Applicable rated tasks, the Fail/Pass ratio would be 3 Fails divided by 31 Passes (3/31) which =  0.0968 but through rounding up would be expressed as 10%.<br>STANDARD: No Major Unit rating may exceed 15%, i.e. rating of 16% or higher would be a performance failure.<br><br>6.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma, Arizona, 85364, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis as provided under FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements with Graver Water Systems, 675 Central Avenue Suite 3, New Providence, NJ 07974. The requirement is for removal and replacement of an entire Reactivator Assembly inside an existing 32' diameter by 22' high concrete tank located in the Pilot System 1 (PS1) Desalination Plant.
Graver Water System's unique qualification is that they supplied the very large Reactivators, 185' in diameter, in the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP). They have the proprietary knowledge necessary to ensure the function of the smaller Reactivator, which this contract is for, is identical to the behavior of the larger Reactivators across all operating ranges and conditions, e.g. pH, salinity, TDS, lime loading, bicarbonate removal, etc.  
The PS1 is a 1/100th scale model of the YDP, functionally identical to the larger plant.  Congress required the PS1 be built in conjunction with the YDP so that new technologies could be tested and proved in a scale model before implementation in the larger production plant. Implementation of new water treatment technologies in the YDP is a very costly affair and potentially disruptive to the Water Treaty with Mexico. If the scale model, PS1, which is used in the proving of these new technologies, is in any way different than the full scale model, the scale model will be flawed.  Implementing a new treatment process in the YDP based on a flawed model could result in a very costly and disruptive mistake.  Additionally, all the testing that was performed in the pilot plant would have been wasted effort and time. 
The NAICS Code for this action is 221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems with a Small Business Size Standard of $7 million.
This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 15 Negotiation and FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures on a Firm Fixed Price Basis.  Anticipated award date is August 1, 2012.   
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. 
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by FAR 6.305. 
Questions and capability statements may be submitted to Jacqueline Carrera, Contract Specialist, YAO-3100, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ 85364, Facsimile (928) 343-8568, or via email at jcarrera@usbr.gov.

<DESC><p>Intent to Sole Source. The Department of Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, Inc., 80 Sherman Street, Cambridge, MA 02140-3504 for EPFR Global Flows Package - weekly data subscription. This will be a modification to the current base year and one option period.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established the OFR within the Treasury Department to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system.<br /><br />Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, Inc. is the only know data source of information on flows into and out of emerging market funds THAT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT FIRM. To attempt to reproduce this data would be prohibitively costly in terms of financial and personnel resources. Treasury does not collect the information from funds, and no other regulatory body collects the data.<br />The EPFR Global Flows Package subscription will provide weekly global equity and fixed income fund flows, fund allocations (county allocation/sector allocations), and country flows. Includes all fund groups. Includes all current and historical data.<br /><br />A request for more information will not be considered an affirmation response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, Inc. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. <br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 05, 2011 by 12:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to Contractadminstration@bpd.treast.gov, Attention: K. Moore.</p>

<DESC>Introduction<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI). The U.S. Copyright Office, a department of the Library of Congress, has initiated a project to digitize and make available online the historical records of copyrights dating from 1870 to 1977. The Library expects to issue a future request for proposals the goal of which would be to select one or more organizations with the skills, experience and equipment to support the capture of information through crowd sourcing. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine the scope and extent of services available in the marketplace to accomplish the crowd sourcing effort.
<p>Background</p>
<p>In addition to its legal, regulatory and policy responsibilities, the Copyright Office is an office of public record for copyright registrations and other documents that pertain to copyright. The records are a historically important snapshot of the culture of the United States, primarily relating to copyrightable expression, authorship, and copyright ownership. They refer to works as diverse as books, photographs, musical compositions, sound recordings, motion pictures, software, and more, including works fixed in electronic formats. The pre-1978 records in the Copyright Office reflect approximately 16.4 million original and renewal registrations dating back to 1870, and approximately 350,000 assignments, transfers and terminations of copyright ownership involving 1.7 million titles. These records are open to the public and are used for many different purposes, including copyright-related commerce, such as licensing, and for historical documentation of authors. Records from 1978 to the present are already available online via the Copyright Office website www.copyright.gov.</p>
<p>There are about 70 million cards and pages among the records from which data will need to be captured to enable online searching and display of the information. The age, condition and formatting of the records limits the use of OCR and therefore much will need to be captured through keyboarding. Some of the data capture tasks will require analysis of the data such as extracting names and titles from the 49 million catalog cards. Some tasks will be semi-analytical such as noting whether a card header is a name or a title. Other tasks will be more specific such as capturing formatted numbers from a set location on similarly formatted cards or pages.</p>
<p>Particular Records in the Office's Possession</p>
<p>There are five primary sets from which records might be selected for crowd source data capture. Digitization of the individual cards and pages has begun with uncompressed TIFF images in 24 bit color at 300 pixels per inch being produced. For crowd source data capture, derivative image files would be made available most likely in JPEG format in color at 300 ppi. The source records include:</p>
<p>1. Copyright Record Books containing the early records of copyright ownership <br />2. Application forms in bound volumes also referred to as Copyright Record Books<br />3. Historical Copyright Card Catalog<br />4. Published Catalogs of Copyright Entries (CCE's)<br />5. Copies of recorded documents pertaining to copyright ownership<br /><br />Crowd Sourcing Requirement</p>
<p>A preliminary analysis of the data capture tasks indicates that some may be simple enough to be carried out by persons unfamiliar with copyright information or the format of the records. For example some records are in a ledger style with specific fields of data. Some data capture may involve keying the identifying record number from a page image. Some may require looking at a catalog card header and the context of the card and keying a code that indicates whether the header is a name or a title.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>The Government shall retain full ownership rights to all deliverables from any future contracts involving the Copyright Digitization and Public Access project including all digital versions of Copyright records, all image files, all data and index files, and all project management and status reports. Such rights shall include both tangible and intangible rights including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and unfair competition. The contractor may claim no rights or legal interest in delivered material including electronic files, their content, or the organization structure of the files or their indexes.</p>
<p><br />RFI Instructions</p>
<p>Interested vendors or organizations should address the following in their submissions:</p>
<p>1. Provide a detailed description of the crowd sourcing service you operate.<br />2. Are there limits on the volume of records or tasks that can be supported?<br />3. How many persons are registered with you to carry out crowd sourcing tasks?<br />4. How do you select and manage persons who are carrying out crowd sourcing tasks?<br />5. How do you determine whether a task is suitable for crowd sourcing? <br />6. How do you make a projection of when a set of tasks will be completed? <br />7. How is payment made to the persons carrying out crowd sourcing tasks?<br />8. How do you invoice the Government for completed tasks?<br />9. What administrative fees do you charge?<br />10. How do you protect against loss of data?<br />11. Do you provide design and development of software for specific data capture tasks?<br />12. What size and type image files do you recommend for crowd source data capture?<br />13. What are your standard quality assurance procedures?<br />14. What are your standard project management procedures?<br />15. What are your standard data security procedures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NOR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE AN ORDER/CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>The records of the Copyright Office referenced in this RFI are public records and may be inspected during regular business hours by interested vendors or organizations in the Madison Building of the Library of Congress in room LM-404. Reader registration is required before access to the records is granted.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the capabilities outlined above.</p>

<SUBJECT>Virtual Card Catalog

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). The U.S. Copyright Office, a department of the Library of Congress, has initiated a project to digitize and make available online the historical records of copyrights dating from 1870 to 1977. The Library expects to issue a future request for proposals the goal of which would be to obtain software to display images of catalog cards via a hierarchical inventory of the catalog drawers. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine the availability of such software in the marketplace either as an existing product or as a potential development effort.
<p>Background</p>
<p>In addition to its legal, regulatory and policy responsibilities, the Copyright Office is an office of public record for copyright registrations and other documents that pertain to copyright. The records are a historically important snapshot of the culture of the United States, primarily relating to copyrightable expression, authorship, and copyright ownership. They refer to works as diverse as books, photographs, musical compositions, sound recordings, motion pictures, software, and more, including works fixed in electronic formats. The pre-1978 records in the Copyright Office reflect approximately 16.4 million original and renewal registrations dating back to 1870, and approximately 350,000 assignments, transfers and terminations of copyright ownership involving 1.7 million titles. These records are open to the public and are used for many different purposes, including copyright-related commerce, such as licensing, and for historical documentation of authors. Records from 1978 to the present are already available online via the Copyright Office website www.copyright.gov.</p>
<p>Virtual Card Catalog Requirement</p>
<p>There are about 49 million cards in the Copyright Card Catalog. The catalog is structured into seven major segments, six are time periods between 1870 and 1977 and the seventh contains the indexes to transfer and assignment documents. Five of the seven segments each have one A to Z filing of cards. The other two segments have subsets each having one A to Z filing of cards.</p>
<p>The long term plan is to capture index terms from the cards using OCR and keyboarding and to build indexes for online searching. This will require significant time and money to achieve. As an interim step, the Copyright Office is considering making the images of the cards in the catalog available online through a hierarchical structure that would mimic the way a researcher would approach and use the physical card catalog. Segments would be made available one at a time. The most likely first segment would be the 1971 to 1977 time period containing approximately 7.7 million card images from one A to Z set of 6,511 drawers. The card images are organized by drawer and the image file names contain the time period, the drawer label, a sequential four digit number starting with 0001, and occasionally an alphabetic suffix when information exists on a verso or there are multiple card images for a single entry.</p>
<p>The following is a general idea of how the virtual card catalog might look and work. A search of the virtual card catalog would probably begin at the top of the hierarchy with the selection of a catalog segment name (e.g., "Registrations 1971 to 1977) perhaps from a drop down list. This would be followed by the entry of a search term (i.e., a name or a title). The software would step down to the next level of the hierarchy within the selected segment and find the "virtual drawer" folder that alphabetically within the segment should contain the term and display that drawer label along with labels for some number of drawers immediately preceding it and some number of drawers immediately following it. The researcher could select any one of the drawers displayed or could return to the initial search screen. For a selected drawer the software might display thumbnails to the left and a full card image to the right as shown in Figure 1 below. The display could allow scrolling through the thumbnails, selection and display of a specific card, and navigation to the next card, the previous card, the beginning of the drawer, the end of the drawer, or to points in the drawer in increments of perhaps two hundred images. The software should support a return to the list of drawers, forward and backward navigation at the drawer level, and return to the initial search screen. This is simply a vision of how the search might look and work and not necessarily a specification. Variations on the hierarchical searching and display might be equally and possibly even more acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitization of the individual cards has begun, producing uncompressed TIFF images in 24 bit color at 300 pixels per inch. For online access, derivative image files would be produced likely in JPEG format in color at 300 ppi. The image files are organized by catalog segment (there are seven major segments) and by drawer label and within a drawer the images have a sequential number sometimes with an alphabetic suffix indicating versos and or multiple card sets for a single entry.</p>
<p><br />Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>The Government shall retain full ownership rights to all deliverables from this RFI or any future contracts involving the Copyright Digitization and Public Access project including all digital versions of Copyright records, all image files, all data and index files, and all project management and status reports. Such rights shall include both tangible and intangible rights including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and unfair competition. The contractor may claim no rights or legal interest in delivered material including electronic files, their content, or the organization structure of the files or their indexes.</p>
<p>RFI Instructions</p>
<p>Interested vendors or organizations should address the following in their submissions:</p>
<p>1. Describe your product for search and display of images or what you would propose to build to meet the virtual card catalog requirement.<br />2. What other services would you propose to provide to assist the Library in meeting this requirement?<br />3. Based on your experience with this type of requirement, describe any potential problems or challenges with building a virtual card catalog.<br />4. What size and type image files do you recommend to ensure efficient delivery and display via the web?<br />5. What are your standard quality assurance procedures?<br />6. What are your standard project management procedures?<br />7. What are your standard data security procedures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NOR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE AN ORDER/CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>The records of the Copyright Office referenced in this RFI are public records and may be inspected during regular business hours by interested vendors or organizations in the Madison Building of the Library of Congress in room LM-404. Reader registration is required before access to the records is granted.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.</p>
<p>At a minimum, responses should include company name and address, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has a new method for generating very low mass visual targets that enablethree-dimensional metrology and photogrammetry measurements (surface position, shape,profile, etc.) for very thin and lightweight structures. The targets use fluorescent dyesincorporated into or applied onto the thin polymer materials used in lightweightstructures. The thin film targets can also be cut out and attached to a surface. Arrangedin a pattern, the invisible targets can be illuminated, using the sun or inexpensivelight source, to make them visible without reflections or distortions. The approachenables lightweight, high-contrast, distortion-free targets that are less complex andintrusive than traditional target solutions. The technology is ideal for space-based,underwater, and industrial metrology applications where nonintrusive, easily integratedmetrology indicators are required.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate thedate and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information.RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses areprovided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO forthe purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conductingpreliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for futurelicensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO willfollow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  Nofollow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a novel approach for a high-density optical datastorage system to advance the typical capabilities of an optical data storage system.Operating at any laser wavelength from infrared (IR), visible, ultraviolet (UV), andX-ray regime, the NASA technology utilizes special beam focusing techniques to achieveextremely short focal lengths and ultra-small spot sizes. The technology could be usedwith any laser wavelength, from IR to UV, and soft X-ray regime can be adapted to takeadvantage of any optical media. The high density data storage capability is solely afunction of the reduced laser/X-ray spot size.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<a href="mailto:julie.m.oliver@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Savannah</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br><br>1.  Contracting Agency:  The responsible contracting agency is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, and P.O. Box 889, Savannah, Georgia 31401-3640.<br><br>2.  Description of Action:  This request is for approval of a sole source procurement for sonic drilling to install monitoring wells for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project.  Award of this contract to Miller Drilling Company, Inc. 107 Helton Drive, Lawrenceburg TN 38464, will provide sonic drilling services and materials to install saltwater intrusion monitoring wells for pre- and post-project groundwater data collection In order to comply with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and Georgia Department of Natural Resources regulations.  32 CFR 652 and AR 200-1 both mandate that documentation of these evaluations be prepared and records kept.  The estimated price is approximately $108,005.00.<br>  <br>3.  Description of Services:  The contractor shall provide all labor, management, supervision, engineering, tools, equipment, materials, supplies, services, and transportation for the Savannah monitoring well Installations in accordance with the attached Scope of Work. <br><br>4.  Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(d) (1) (B) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Previous contract W912HN-P-0123 was issued to Miller Drilling Company (MDC) for this work.  One of five required monitoring wells was 90-percent completed under this contract.  The new contract will be a continuation of the original work.  MDC has not de-mobilized from the site and will not charge for de-mob other than at the completion of all work, which will save the Government additional costs.  In the original solicitation for the previous contract, MDC was the only bidder that could do the work for a fair and reasonable cost to the Government.  If this work is awarded to another Contractor, they will not likely take responsibility for completion of the partially installed well.<br><br>6.  Awarding a new follow-on contract to MDC, whose equipment is already on site and has site experience, will result in substantial cost savings to the government, continuity of services, and timely acquisition of data critical to the start-up schedule of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project.  The time involved to wait for a new contract to be executed would adversely affect the overall project schedule.<br><br>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  It is incumbent upon the Government to ensure project delays and additional costs do not occur.  There is no other source equally qualified to provide the necessary requirements under the circumstances.  The requirement of these services cannot reasonably be met by another source because of the need to minimize cost and impact to project schedule.<br><br>8.  Other Factors:  Follow-on Contracts:  This is a follow-on contract with additional requirements based on finding from the initial contract.  In accordance with FAR 6.301-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), "For DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."<br><br>9.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance that are included in this J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br>NAME:  Cardwell Smith  <br>TITLE:	Project Manager			SIGNATURE	/signed/		 <br><br>10.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated cost of this contract action will be fair and reasonable.  Comparison with the independent government estimate will be used in determining reasonableness of costs.<br><br>11.  Procuring Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this J&A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br>NAME :  Julie M. Oliver			DATE:  5 Mar 2012<br>TITLE:  Contracting Officer		SIGNATURE:  /signed/<br>			 <br><br>

The Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is the preferred Government repository for contractor submitted representations and certifications required for the conduct of business with the Government.  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the paper-based versions are also acceptable and shall be returned with the offer.<br><br>52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) in accordance with FAR 15.101-2.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>(i) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. In order for the offeror to be considered technically capable, the Government will make a determination by evaluating the following: (1) Ability of the offeror to provide a brand-name (or equal) item that meets or exceeds ALL of the required salient characteristics and (2) Ability of the offeror to meet the delivery schedule/terms as stated in the relevant section of this solicitation.<br><br>Factor 1 Roll-up:  Failure to meet any of these requirements shall render an "unacceptable" rating under this factor and the offeror will no longer be eligible for award.<br><br>(ii) FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past performance will be evaluated to determine the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements and will be assessed either an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" rating.  The past performance submitted for evaluation must be recent and relevant.  To be recent, the effort must have been performed during the last three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation; to be relevant, the effort must be similar in complexity and scope, i.e. the contract was for a similar piece of equipment in terms of the equipment's intended purpose and functions as the one requested under the instant solicitation.  The offeror shall select up to three (3) of its Government customers (Local, State and/or Federal) for which it has performed recent/relevant efforts as described herein and forward a copy of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire.  The questionnaires shall be completed by the contracting activity and returned directly to the Contract Specialist at email address provided in the instructions accompanying the form.  The burden of ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted to the Contract Specialist rests with the offeror.  Offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance SHALL provide a statement to that fact (offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "acceptable" rating).<br><br>Rating Descriptions:<br>Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br>Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>Method for Collecting Past Performance Information:<br>The Government will evaluate the customer-completed Past Performance Questionnaires.  The information submitted may be verified by the Government by contacting the references provided.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to query other past performance sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).<br><br>Factor 2 Roll-up:  This factor must receive a rating of "acceptable" in order to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.<br><br>(iii) FACTOR 3 - PRICE. Price will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's proposed price is fair, reasonable, and balanced utilizing any one or a combination of the price analysis techniques identified in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2).<br><br>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.<br><br>[End of Provision 52.212-2]<br><br><br>52.212-5, Contract terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

(End of clause)<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401Ft.

<p>TITLE: "Thermal and chemical characteristics of homemade explosives"</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />This procurement is being conducted for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), Chemical and Biochemical Reference Data Division (CBRDD) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. A research program has been initiated at NIST to develop a thermal- and chemical-signature database for forensic analysis of homemade explosives (HME), using a currently operational rapid laser heating approach, referred to as the laser-driven thermal reactor (LDTR). The NIST LDTR is a state-of-the-art technique, which uses a novel approach to determine the thermal behavior and decomposition of multiphase/multicomponent solid and liquid substances, such as energetics, fuels, and propellants through rapid and controlled heating with laser radiation. It provides in-situ, near temporally resolved determination of substance thermophysical properties and chemical reaction characteristics over a wide range of temperatures, heating rates, gas pressures, and ambient environments. The technique also has the capability to collect chemical reaction products for spectroscopic chemical analysis. The technique can provide in-situ, temporally resolved quantitative information for rates of heat release and chemical kinetics, total heat value, specific heat/energy release, threshold temperature for thermal explosion, and chemical reaction product identification.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>a. OBJECTIVES/PURPOSE <br />Development of thermal-/chemical-signature database for HME.</p>
<p>b. GENERAL:<br />The Contractor shall conduct measurements of thermal and chemical characteristics of HME and perform analysis of LDTR thermograms and chemical-reaction product spectrograms.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This is a Solicitation for the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Habitat Conservation (OHC), located in Silver Spring, MD is seeking services for Caribbean coral restoration support contract for vessel and dive support in the area of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Government intends to issue a Time and Materials contract with a Not To Exceed capacity of $950,000.00 and a period of performance of three (3) years from date of award.
<p>DOC/NOAA/NMFS/OHC interacts with NOAA/NMFS regional offices to manage, conserve and enhance habitats for fishery resources, protected species and other living marine resources, and is the focal point for marine and estuarine habitat restoration within NOAA. The Restoration Center (RC), a division of OHC, performs coastal habitat restoration pursuant to federal legislation and improves the state of restoration ecology and habitat management, and is responsible for restoring degraded habitats, advancing the science of coastal habitat restoration, transferring restoration technologies to other agencies and practitioners, and fostering habitat stewardship and a conservation ethic. In support of these responsibilities, OHC ensures that NOAA's resources are protected and restored in accordance with appropriate Acts and mandates. <br /><br />Coral Reefs in the U.S. Caribbean (USVI and PR) reefs are annually impacted by 1-2 hurricanes, 2-3 large ship groundings, nearly 100 of small boat groundings, and tons of marine debris and derelict fishing. These physical impacts from hurricanes, vessel groundings, anchors, and marine debris are major threats to coral reef health and integrity and present a direct disturbance to the coral environment that can completely alter a reefs structure and function. After these acute disturbances, fragments are subject to abrasion, scour, and sedimentation, which can ultimately result in death. Unchecked, these damages can result in reef loss and instability, reducing coastal protection, causing economic impact to local fisheries, and eliminating key tourist attractions on which many coastal economies depend. However, if dislodged fragments can be collected and stabilized shortly after physical impact then, the probability of survival increases substantially. <br />While NOAA and local jurisdictions have some limited personnel and desire to respond to these impact events, we often have difficulties securing the necessary logistical support (vessel and dive support) to respond to these events in a timely manner.<br />In addition to these direct physical impacts NOAA is also often faced with logistical limitations when responding to other hazard events and/or when conducting general coral reef management and research activities.<br />In an effort to address the limited logistical support discussed above NOAA seeks support from a firm that can provide logistical support to the local partners and NOAA staff conducting activities in the region. See Scope of Services in attached solicitation.</p>

<DESC>For a complete copy of this COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION (P12PS23837), please email Stacy_Vallie@nps.gov.
Yellowstone National Park requires two (2) electronic highway signs to inform motorists of the status of park roads and entrances.  
One sign will be placed on U.S. 89 (hereafter sign A), approximately one mile south of Livingston, Montana, with another sign (hereafter sign B) to be placed on U.S. 14/16/20, approximately one mile west of Cody, Wyoming.  Both signs will be in 55 mile per hour (mph) speed zones.
Tentative approval from the Montana and Wyoming Departments of Transportation has been received; however, a final draft of the sign will need to be approved before manufacturing of the sign. The Park will submit the final draft drawings to MDT and WYDOT for their approval before the Park will authorize the signs to be manufactured.  
SPECIFICATIONS:
Both signs are expected to meet the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), including reflectivity and character/letter size.  Both signs are expected to be white lettering on a green background.  The green arrow and red cross lights (symbols) must meet MUTCD requirements for being able to be seen in both direct sunlight and at night.  Sun shades around the lights can be part of the sign design.
The background for the arrow and the cross should be a contrasting color (preferably black), and the sign should be such that it is easy for motorist to determine if the road/entrance is open or closed (i.e., which of the lights/symbols is on).  The green arrow is similar to what would be used for left- or right-hand turn signals already used for traffic signals (stop lights).  The red x would be similar to what is used for reversible lanes and/or toll booth signals.
The signs and their systems shall be capable of performing in all types of weather, including precipitation (rain and snow), and shall be able to operate in temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-400F) to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (+1200F).
This RFQ is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  All small business concerns may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the National Park Service (NPS).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339950 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. 
QUOTES ARE DUE for this combined synopsis/solicitation on May 14, 2012, at 4:30 PM Mountain Standard Time and shall be delivered by the specified time to the National Park Service, Mammoth Supply Center, Building 34, Yellowstone National Park  WY  82190, ATTN Contracting Office.  Email or faxed quotes are preferred using this form with all required documentation, no oral quotations will be accepted.  Offerors must furnish the company name, DUNS number, address, phone and fax number, email address if available, and official point of contact.  All Quotes must be signed by authorized company official and faxed to 307-344-2079 or emailed to stacy_vallie@nps.gov.   All quotes from small business will be considered, however; to be considered for award, vendor must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and we request that you put the Reps and Certs information online at the ORCA website, https://orca.bpn.gov/.   All questions regarding this solicitation should be faxed or emailed to stacy_vallie@nps.gov.  No phone calls please.
Delivery of the signs shall not exceed 75 days after award.  Delivery time shall be proposed in response to this solicitation and used as an evaluation factor for award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. RFQ number RFQ-KS-12-00014 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotation. The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular. The requirement is "Full and Open Competition" with a NAICS Code of 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing) and a size standard in millions of dollars $6.5. <br /><br />EPA Region 7 is seeking to procure the YSI Inc brand satellite telemetry systems that are compatible with EPA's existing YSI Inc. brand water quality monitoring equipment such as hand held units, data loggers, sondes, multi-parameter probes, cables and an inventory of replacement parts. EPA Region 7 will use this new equipment as interchangeably with existing equipment and will use many of the items to repair or modify existing hardware. Over the past several years, several hundred paired turbidity readings and bacteria samples were taken by EPA Region 7 with YSI sondes, in order to derive a statistical relationship between bacteria and turbidity. The use of a different manufacturer's sondes would require Region 7 to repeat field collection, laboratory analysis, and data assessment at a significant expense, and would ultimately set the project back a year or more. Additionally, EPA is entering into a joint long-term project to integrate their system with the U.S. Geological Survey`s YSI Inc. telemetry real-time system in the greater Kansas City area. It is essential to the success of this joint effort that the EPA and USGS systems meet exacting standards of compatibility beginning with identical telemetry field equipment, since EPA may install additional EPA sondes on USGS probes.<br /><br />The selection resulting from this request for quotation will be made on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote from responsible quoter who meets the minimum requirements. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using an Optional Form 347. A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order. Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or in any applicable provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotation not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for bid. Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of information furnished by the quoter that demonstrates that they meet the Minimum system requirements. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the quote. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted. Quotes must be mailed and are due on March 23, 2012 at 12:00 PM Central Saving Time (CST) along with the completed representations and certifications, providing the business size, e-mail address, Dunn and Bradstreet number, CAGE code and Federal Tax ID number. In addition, quoters must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database at www.ccr.gov to be considered for selection. Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quotes. FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following clauses within 52.247-64 are applicable to this acquisition: 52.219-14, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-39, 52.222-41, 52.246-4

<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (Addendum)</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITEIA</p>
<p>An IDIQ will be awarded to the company determined to represent the best value to the USCG. The tradeoff process will lead to an award decision that is made between the following price and non-priced evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach<br />Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>For each factor, offerors are required to provide the information described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach: The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical approach to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Instructor qualifications and curriculum information will be evaluated to determine the offerors capability of fulfilling the requirements. A completed copy of the provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certification - Commercial Items, should be included in the offer.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. Past performance references must include contact information, dollar value, and a description of the work performed. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Quoted prices will be compared against competition and ranked from the most expensive to the least expensive.</p>

<p><br />SECTION IV<br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR TRAINING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE <br />U.S. COAST GUARD, OFFICE OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, <br />AVIATION DIVISION (CG-1131)<br />FAA CERTIFICATIONS</p>
<p><br />1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />This effort requires the Contractor to make available quotas in the two (2) listed short term instructional courses for maintenance of the Coast Guard's Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft. All classes will require the Contractor to provide classroom instruction</p>
<p>(1) FAA Airframe and Power Plant (A&amp;P) Certification Course - up to 6 quotas <br />annually.<br />(2) FAA Inspection Authorization (IA) Certification Course - up to 2 quotas annually.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard, Chief of Aeronautical Engineering, (CG-41) is responsible for all maintenance action performed by the aircraft mechanics and aircraft technicians at Air Station Washington, D.C (AS DC). The U.S. Coast Guard employs a bi-level maintenance structure. This structure consists of depot level maintenance and organizational maintenance. The U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center located in Elizabeth City, NC coordinates depot level maintenance for all Coast Guard Aircraft. Each Air Station is responsible for completing organizational maintenance at their unit. The organizational maintenance performed by mechanics and technicians at AS DC provides safe and operable GV aircraft which are used to transport the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>The majority of Coast Guard aircraft are maintained and certified airworthy as a pubic aircraft under the Federal Aviation Regulations. The Coast Guard has chosen to maintain the civil aircraft airworthiness certification on its GV aircraft. As a result, the Coast Guard needs FAA certified mechanics and inspectors to maintain its GV aircraft. Traditionally, the Coast Guard would create and maintain an organic training capability for mechanics and inspectors responsible for maintaining GV Aircraft. However, since the Coast Guard operates a very limited quantity of GV aircraft, it is not cost effective for the Coast Guard to maintain an organic training capability. <br />1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Program Manager The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who shall be responsible for all Contractor work performed under this contract.</p>

<p>SECTION V<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>All existing&nbsp;fixtures will be removed prior to the start of this project. There should be a total of four shelves in&nbsp;all&nbsp;ten&nbsp;of the 36" deep fixtures including the base shelf, and a total of six shelves in&nbsp;all four of the&nbsp;24" deep&nbsp;fixtures including the base shelf. The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each fixture, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving&nbsp;fixture and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br /><br />The first&nbsp;fixture will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile. The last two shelving&nbsp;fixture will face each other so the entire system can be locked up when not in use. To do so, all mobile&nbsp;fixtures shall be closed up towards the stationary fixture.<br /><br />When open, the aisle width shall be 61.5".<br />The shelf arrangement will be as follows:<br />36"&nbsp;Fixtures - base shelf, plus three more shelves approximately 36" apart<br />24" Fixtures - base shelf, plus five more shelves approximately 25" apart<br />The structure shall be designed to support 1,000lbs per shelf, including the top of the fixtures. It is a possibility that material may be stored up there as well.<br />Tracks will be built into a concrete base (no plywood)&nbsp;so carts may be rolled over the tracks without difficulty.</p>
<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage&nbsp;system will entirely replace the existing&nbsp;stationary storage fixtures. All fixtures except for the first fixture, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. The first fixture will be on the same track but it will not be motorized.&nbsp;To secure the&nbsp;system tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;fixtures being replaced are shown in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; **UPDATE 4/27/2012**</strong></p>
<p>All salient characteristics described in the attached document titled "salient characteristics" shall take precedence over those in this description. In the event of conflicting information, the information defined in the "salient characteristics" document shall be relied upon.</p>
<p><br /><strong>UPDATE 4/30/2012 - Clarification<br /><br /></strong>The top shelf is not at the top of the fixture. It is positioned approximately 36" below the top of the fixture in the 36" fixtures and 25" below the top of the fixture in the 24" fixtures.<br /><br /><br />Due to this delayed clarification, the response date has been extended 24 hours.<br />&nbsp;</p>

All work will be done during the working hours of 0700 to 1700 (7 am to 5 pm). We will provide all electrical work necessary. There are no prevaling wages for this buy. Additional lighting will not be necessary.<br /><br /><br />CORRECTION:<br />None of the existing&nbsp;fixtures will be part of this requirement. All fixtures will be removed. Therefore, it is no longer a requirement to match the existing shelving and doing so will not give you any sort of advantage since there will be no existing shelving by the time work begins.<br /><br />NOTICE:<br />The response date has been extended.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>**UPDATE 4/27/2012**</strong>
<p>All salient characteristics described in the attached document titled "salient characteristics" shall take precedence over those in this description.

<p>The top shelf is not at the top of the fixture. It is positioned approximately 36" below the top of the fixture.</p>

(End of clause)<BR><BR>The RAPIDGate Program enables electronic verification of identity and access privileges at Fort McCoy?s access control points (ACPs), thereby improving security and streamlining access to the installation.
Access Privilege Management
Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate. 
 Companies choosing not to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will be required to access the installation through the Main Gate, utilizing the commercial lane only. To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>If a Seller decides to include a trade-in offer as specified in the attached Salient Features, the "Unit Price" provided in Fedbid should reflect the unit price of the unit being quoted MINUS the trade-in price being offered.  The Seller should also specify in their "Seller Bid Specifications" the trade-in price being offered.  Quotes provided without trade-in pricing will be evaluated against quotes that reflect pricing after trade-in pricing has been incorporated.<BR><BR>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate.

To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>If a Seller decides to include a trade-in offer as specified in the attached Salient Features, the "Unit Price" provided in Fedbid should reflect the unit price of the unit being quoted MINUS the trade-in price being offered.  The Seller should also specify in their "Seller Bid Specifications" the trade-in price being offered.  Quotes provided without trade-in pricing will be evaluated against quotes that reflect pricing after trade-in pricing has been incorporated.<BR><BR>

<p><strong><br />Proposal Submission Place:</strong><br />Mr. Rachid Hadi<br />Director of Operations, Port of Casablanca<br />Member of the Board of Directors<br />Marsa Maroc<br />2, Bd Des Almohades-20 100<br />Casablanca, Marocco<br />Phone: +212 6 61 91 56 03<br />Email:&nbsp;hadi@marsamaroc.co.ma<br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study (the "Study") that will identify and recommend site specific initiatives and related investments to improve the security and safety of operations at the Port of Casablanca. The Study will evaluate and recommend the technical, institutional, and financial investments necessary for the Port of Casablanca to fully comply with International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) security protocol. The Study will also recommend operational strategies, including safety and security training modules and a revised standard operation procedures manual, to improve the safety of the work environment. In addition, the Study will prepare a Facility and Equipment Requirements Implementation Plan, a Standard Operating Procedures Manual, and a Safety and Security Training Module.</p>
<p>With its strategic geographical location, Morocco's ports system is an international logistics platform between Europe and Africa. Since 1980, Moroccan ports overall shipping volume has been growing at an annual average growth rate of 5%. Accordingly, Morocco is investing in projects to increase port capacity; encourage greater private sector participation in port commercial activities; reduce port transit costs; and strengthen the competitiveness of the national shipping lines. Between 2011-2015, the Moroccan government, through the National Ports Agency (ANP), will invest $360 million to modernize port infrastructure along its expansive Atlantic coastline.</p>
<p>Morocco has 34 ports, 11 of which include international commercial activities. The Port of Casablanca is the country's largest port, accounting for 32% of overall national traffic. This traffic is expected to increase as ANP has committed to a new $76.5 million investment for a logistics and multimodal zone in Casablanca, which will increase the Port's connectivity to inland transportation sources. The primary goods processed at the Port of Casablanca include vehicles; food products; iron and steel; wood products; cattle feed; and coal.</p>
<p>In 2006, Morocco passed a ports sector reform to split the functions of authority and business operations throughout ports in Morocco, enabling competition between port operators and allowing for increased private sector participation. As result of this legislation, ANP was instituted as the port authority of Morocco and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; D'Exploitation des Ports (Marsa Maroc) as a prime port operator. Marsa Maroc currently manages the ports of Casablanca, Mohammedia, Agadir, Safi, Jorf Lasfar, and Tangier-Med II and employs 2,300 people. Between 2011-2013, Marsa Maroc plans to issue $18 million in procurement opportunities for equipment and services to support cargo and container facilities.</p>
<p>As the primary port, the Port of Casablanca is the priority investment of Marsa Maroc and is committed to improving both security and safety throughout their port operations. Currently, the Port of Casablanca is seeking to implement the advanced security measures of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS). Among other standards, the ISPS recommends minimum security arrangements for port facilities used in international trade. Marsa Maroc also recognizes the need to increase safety capacity and improve operating procedures to ensure maximum safety of the port infrastructure, workers, and operators.</p>
<p>The objective of the Study is to identify and recommend site specific initiatives and related investments to improve the security and safety of operations at the Port of Casablanca. The Study will evaluate and recommend the technical, institutional, and financial investments necessary for the Port of Casablanca to fully comply with ISPS security protocol. The Study will also recommend operational strategies, including safety and security training modules and a revised standard operation procedures manual, to improve the safety of the work environment. In addition, the Study will prepare a Facility and Equipment Requirements Implementation Plan, a Standard Operating Procedures Manual, and a Safety and Security Training Module.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$571,458 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  N.B.:  The U.S. firm selected to work on the Port of Casablanca Safety and Security Feasibility Study will not be permitted to participate in the implementation phase of the project, per the procurement laws that apply to the Grantee.</p>

BEQ 105. Min 26 Max 158<br />DESTINATION: SW3211 - Tinker AFB, OK 73145-8000<br />REQUIRED DELIVERY: 10 units monthly, beginning 31 Oct 2013<br />QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: N/A<br />EXPORT CONTROLLED: NO<br /><br />SURPLUS MATERIAL- Both new/unused and used/overhauled Government or commercial surplus material may be considered for award.<br /><br />QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): United Technologies Corp./Pratt &amp; Whitney (CAGES52661 / 77445), Flanagan Brothers (CAGE 06959)In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall beconsidered by the agency.This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions,identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible,participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses tothis notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers,the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors orpotential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested,the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405)734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies ofthe solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitationwill be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can bedirected to the buyer, Stephen Smiley 405-734-8114,Stephen.smiley@tinker.af.mil.

<DESC><p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The 92d Contracting Squadron will be soliciting for a competitive 8(a), Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build (up to 35%) construction efforts to support the 92d CES mission at Fairchild AFB, Washington. <br />Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,500 to $650,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $7M over a two-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and one 12-month option period.<br />Work to be performed under the MATOC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving. Locations of work will be at Fairchild AFB, WA and other associated sites outside the base proper. All off base sites are within 80 miles of Fairchild AFB. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns who are expressly certified for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan. <br />It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area of Region 10, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business within the Region 10 geographical competitive area, and the assigned NAICS code.&nbsp; All other 8(a) BD Participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.&nbsp; <br /><strong>Evaluation:<br /></strong>Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated utilizing best value source selection procedures. The basis for award is to be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) without technical factors. The procedures described in FAR Part 15.3, AFFAR 5315.3, Policy Memorandums 11-C-04 and 11-C-07 and source selection procedures will be utilized. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a seed project. The magnitude of the seed project is less than $25,000. The offeror's Past Performance will be considered approximately equal in importance to the Seed Project's Price.

Also, all offeror's shall show the capability of receiving $3M in bonding annually. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer deems discussions are in the Government's best interest. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision, considering price and past performance tradeoff, for award of the seed project. Additional MATOC contract awards will be determined based on the final rankings of the highest rated proposals from the SSA's integrated assessment best value award decision.<br /><br /><strong>Award:</strong> The Government anticipates awarding up to three (3) Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. In addition, up to three (3) Fixed Price Task Orders to attend an orientation seminar will be awarded to meet the minimum contract guarantee resulting from this solicitation, not to exceed $2,500 and in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation. Contractor's participation in this seminar, held at Fairchild AFB, is mandatory. Future individual task order requirements will be competed among the awardees in accordance with the solicitation and contract provisions. In the event this RFP results in only one award, the awardee shall proceed to construct the project described in this RFP as the seed project as required by the terms of the resulting contract. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to cancel this RFP either before or after the closing date.<br /><br />The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about 10 May 2012 and close on or about 10 June 2012.

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) and product samples only. This is not an Invitation to Bid nor a Request for Proposals. There is currently no acquisition funding available for this effort. <br><br>However, Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) has a requirement to conduct an Army Bright White Light Evaluation. The goals of this effort are:<br><br>(1) To solicit samples of the latest Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) bright white <br>light technology from vendors<br><br>(2) Test samples against the Army's Family of Flashlights (FoF) Crew Served <br>Weapons Light (CSWL) requirements, in accordance with (IAW) the Army's latest <br>CSWL Product Evaluation Test (PET) Detailed Test Plan (DTP), MIL-STD-461F <br>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) tests, and Army Institute of Public Health <br>(IPH) Optical Radiation Hazard Evaluation<br><br>(3) Report the test results to the DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate. <br><br>This is a market survey to identify any manufacturers who have commercially available Bright White Lights. Vendors are encouraged to submit Bright White Light systems, even if not specifically designed to be used as a CSWL. All test results will be presented to members of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons community for their consideration in choosing the appropriate lights for their unique applications. <br><br>The systems will be tested to CWSL requirements to the maximum extent possible. While sources are sought that can provide COTS items that are already in production, Non Developmental Items (NDIs) that can be delivered for comparative testing by 16 April 2012 are also acceptable. Ten (10) samples will be required for the evaluation process. PM SMS requests that interested parties submit ten product samples and necessary technical data (see description below) to the addresses given under Responses (below). It is further requested that responses be limited to one product model per vendor. Samples will be tested in accordance with requirements described under CSWL System Requirements (listed below). A detailed test plan is available upon request from PM Soldier Maneuvers and Sensors (PM SMS). Samples and associated equipment will be returned following testing, along with final test results for each product. The Government assumes no liability for any equipment submitted. Vendors should provide a return address with their sample submission. <br><br><br>CSWL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:<br><br>The CSWL will allow Soldiers to employ a white light with infrared (IR) capability that is small, lightweight, and can be weapon-mounted or hand-held. When weapon-mounted, the CSWL will provide Soldiers the capability to identify targets accurately with the unaided eye, except where applicable by common (non-magnified) weapon sights and Night Vision Devices, or when using the weapon during periods of darkness or limited visibility. The CSWL will be employed with M2 series machine guns, the MK-19 grenade machine gun (threshold), and the M240B medium machine gun (objective). The CSWL must be able to withstand weapon recoil, and must be able to mount on the U.S. Army Standard Rail (MIL-STD-1913) using an interface device. The CSWL shall have a fixed beam (threshold) and an adjustable beam (narrow to wide) (objective) that allow illumination up to a range of 100 meters (threshold) and 300 meters (objective)with IR light, and 200 meters (threshold) and 400 meters (objective) with white light, in total darkness (between sunset and sunrise).

The CSWL shall be compatible with (shall not interfere with) appropriate day/night optics, aiming lights and other weapon accessories. The CSWL shall have dual activation controls; an on/off switch and a wired remote control switch shall be located on the device housing. A full-off control shall also be provided on the device housing, which will prevent activation controls from functioning. The system shall operate on standard military or DoD-approved commercially available batteries. Acceptable non-vehicular battery performance (with the light constantly on) must be 90 minutes (threshold). Degraded battery performance in extreme temperatures or with prolonged use of the light is acceptable (threshold). When mounted on a military vehicle, the CSWL will be able to operate on vehicle power. The CSWL shall also be compatible with the vehicle mounted Objective Gunner Protection Kit (OGPK) protection systems (threshold). The CSWL shall include a detachable dust cover lens. The CSWL requires an IR capability (threshold). The CSWL bulb must be replaceable by the operator and not require any special tools. When mounted to the MIL-STD 1913 Rail, the mounting bracket shall allow the light to be adjusted to any position on the rail from front to rear and to be quickly and easily mounted to, and dismounted from, the M2 Series HMG, the MK19 GMG (threshold), and the M240B (objective). The CSWL must be capable of being used when Soldiers are wearing Army standard issue or unit authorized combat gloves. The CSWL must provide for one-handed, ambidextrous operation. The CSWL must be capable of being dropped from 3 feet without impacting operational capability. The CSWL must be capable of being immersed in 3 feet of water or exposed to moisture. The CSWL must be able to operate in 5 percent to 100 percent relative humidity without degradation of capability.<br><br>All samples submitted for the evaluation will be given an initial inspection to determine readiness for testing. The Aberdeen Test Center will perform a physical inspection and inventory of CSWL candidates, and will determine if the test item candidates are complete, undamaged, and fully operational for testing (including the capability of being mounted and dismounted from the test weapons). Test items that do not pass the initial inspection will be returned to the vendor and no testing will be conducted. <br><br>RESPONSES: <br><br>Responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be in two parts; technical documentation and (ten) test samples.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notification of the intent to solicit proposals for multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts to provide construction services to the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Task orders will be FFP.
<p>NIST has facilities located in Boulder, Colorado and Wellington, Colorado. These locations consist of approximately 30 separate buildings totaling approximately 650,000 square feet, which consist of scientific research laboratories and clean rooms, warehouses, machine shops, maintenance shops, a central utility plant, administrative offices and conference/auditorium facilities, along with radio transmission sites. The age of the facilities ranges from the late 1950s to present day, state of the art technology and construction. The NIST is seeking qualified firms to provide construction services, with emphasis on firms that have general contractor capabilities and experience with multiple-craft construction projects.</p>
<p>Each IDIQ will have a twelve (12) month base period of performance with options for four additional twelve (12) month periods. Each IDIQ contract awarded will have a $3,000 minimum over the life of the contract. The total awarded under all multiple award IDIQ contracts will not exceed $50,000,000 over the life of the contracts.</p>
<p>The proposed contracts are 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this requirement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the size standard is $33.5 million in annual receipts (average annual gross revenue for the last three years.)</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, the contractors will be required to perform at least 15% (for general construction) or 25% (for special trade construction) of the cost of contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>
<p>Task order projects may include, but are not limited to, construction/renovation of scientific research laboratory facilities and administrative facilities (offices, operation centers, and warehouses), utilities, electrical systems, water, sewage systems, ADA compliance requirements, safety systems such as fall protection devices/guardrails, solar/energy conservation systems, roofs, communications, security systems, radio transmission towers, HVAC systems, roads, fences, and gates.</p>
<p>Construction activities may consist of, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. Construction services including site renovations and renovations of existing labs and offices up to and including the complete strip out of selected areas and the reconstruction of new labs and offices in facilities built as long ago as the early 1950s.</p>
<p>2. Structural demolition and construction including foundations, concrete, steel and other materials used in the construction trades</p>
<p>3. Mechanical demolition and construction including energy conservation, heating and ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, fire protection, alarms, sprinkler systems, special mechanical systems and process systems. May include the repair, replacement, and or upgrading of mechanical systems or equipment, including controls.</p>
<p>4. Electrical construction including power service and distribution, lighting, telephones, fire detection and alarms, security systems, electronic communications, special electrical systems, energy conservation, code analysis, and general space requirements.

<p>6. Surveying shall include field surveying required for construction activities.</p>
<p>7. The disassembling and reassembling, moving of laboratory/office equipment/furniture, from one area to a new location and or storage during the activities described in the SOW may be required.</p>
<p>All tasks will be performed in and around occupied areas where scientific/research experiments are performed. In many cases, vibration, noise, utility outages, and disturbances to the physical environment will hinder the ability of the Government to perform required activities. This is not a Request for Proposal. The solicitation/Request for Proposal will be released mid-May, 2012 with a proposal due date approximately thirty (30) days thereafter, and an award anticipated for late July, 2012.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for TBD on the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting.</p>
<p>IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE PLEASE CONTACT JENNIFER MALCOLM AT (303) 497-3764 OR LEISA LORD AT (303) 497-3032.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The proposed action will be accomplished pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 because of general liability due to insurance and overall cost effectiveness due to site constraints.</span></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The need exist to provide labor and materials to move, disassemble and reassemble workstations; remove and re-hang artwork, pictures and plaques; pack and unpack chambers, library gun lockers etc., using contract employees cleared through the HSPD-12 Clearance Process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Due to the highly sensitive court documentation and the high profile nature of this move, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the U.S. Marshal office will not grant access to the facility for individuals not cleared through the HSPD-12 security clearance process.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">When the agency's need is of an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This acquisition requires the use of HSPD-12 cleared contractors. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Region 5, Greater Chicagoland Service Center has three IDIQ contractors for the Rockford, IL area, only CQIS meets this clearance requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A-Z Moving and C.H. Coakley do not meet the HSPD-12 clearance requirement. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If A-Z Moving and C.H. Coakley were considered for this acquisition, their employees would not be able to attain a HSPD-12 clearance before April 17, around the scheduled move dates because the current HSPD-12 Clearance Process takes 4-6 months for contractors to be adjudicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">CQIS does meet the clearance requirement however; on previous moves in Rockford, IL tenants were not satisfied with their performance. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Bankruptcy Court and U.S. Marshals Service has expressed to GSA that due to the high profile nature of this move that GSA finds another contractor who meets the clearance requirement to perform these services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The GSA Schedule contractor Kane Company (GS-33F-0017R) has employees that are cleared through the HSPD-12 clearance process and are able to perform the scope of work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unusual and compelling urgency indicates that an action need not be synopsized if an unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Description of Efforts to Solicit as Many Offers as Practicable</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Request for Information (RFI) was issued through GSA e-buy, on March 19, 2012, to see if there were other moving companies that could meet the requirements of the scope of work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are 106 vendors available under SIN 653 8, six reviewed the requirement; however no one responded, by the RFI closing date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to contract directly with the Kane Company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A competitively awarded contract is not feasible since only one source will satisfy the agencies requirements of having all employees cleared through HSPD-12 with no escorts. The scheduled dates of the move will not allow for additional contractors to be solicited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the Kane Company has a GSA, Federal Schedule Contract (GS-33F-0017R).</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Demonstration that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A Government Cost Estimate will be used to determine price reasonableness.</span></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Nothing other than what was stated under Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited, above.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">On March 6, 2012, Larry Chwirut, with Kane Company, informed GSA that Joyce Bros is their sub-contractor to handle agency moves for the Rockford, Illinois area. GSA was also informed that Kane Company, sub-contractor Joyce Bros. has 19 employees cleared through the HSPD-12 clearance process and the employees names were given to GSA to verify.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GSA has verified that Joyce Bros. employees are cleared through HSPD-12 and received their GCIMS clearance. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The moves are scheduled for around April 17, 2010, there is insufficient time for the HSPD-12 clearance process. Given this fact, there are no actions that could be taken to remove or overcome the existing barriers to competition.</span></p>
