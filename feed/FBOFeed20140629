<DESC>Eligible Applicants: Public and State controlled institutions of higher education Private institutions of higher education <br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of University Programs (OUP), within the Science and Technology Directorate is releasing a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for a new DHS Critical Infrastructure and Resilience Center of Excellence (CIRC) Cooperative Agreement. On or about June 29, 2014, this FOA will be available electronically through the Grants.gov website (http://www.grants.gov) by clicking "Search Grants" to "Basic Search Criteria" and typing in announcement number DHS-14-ST-061-COE-CIRC-001A. All proposals in response to this FOA must be submitted electronically via the Grants.gov. Electronic proposals must be submitted in their entirety by 11:59:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposal due date of September 23, 2014.<br />Proposals for the CIRC Lead must be submitted by an accredited U.S. institution of higher education that, along with its chosen partners, has the ability and capacity to conduct the required research. The applicant institution must be identified as the official lead for proposal submission and subsequent negotiations. U.S. accredited business and law schools are also encouraged to apply either as lead or partner institutions. <br /><br />The Center Lead institution will fund partnering organizations through sub-awards. For applicants interested in only submitting a partner proposal, OUP is also posting a separate FOA for eligible applicants to submit single project proposals for consideration as a partner to this Center of Excellence (COE). Please see FOA Number DHS-14-ST-061-COE-CIRC-001B or CDFA #97.061 on http://www.grants.gov for directions on how to submit single project proposals. DHS may add individual project partners from applications received for either the Center Lead FOA or the Center Partner FOA to CIRC. All proposals in response to this FOA must be submitted electronically via the Grants.gov. Electronic partner proposals must be submitted in their entirety by 11:59:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposal due date of September 23, 2014.<br /><br />The CIRC Lead institution will partner with cross-sector organizations, industries, businesses, international organizations, and public institutions to develop and implement technologies and solutions described in the FOA. The Center is expected to partner with academic institutions including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Hispanic serving institutions (HSIs), and/or other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs); as well as institutions in states that are part of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR); and non-profit organizations, including any organizations that meet the definition of nonprofit in OMB Circular A-122, relocated to 2 CFR Part 230. However, nonprofit organizations described in Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code that engage in lobbying activities as defined in Section 3 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 are not eligible to apply. <br /><br />The DHS COEs are university consortia that work closely with DHS to conduct research, develop and transition mission-relevant science and technology, and educate the next generation of homeland security technical experts. DHS COEs operate using a unique research management approach where researchers work alongside operational and decision-making personnel to explore opportunities and enhance capabilities that protect the Nation's infrastructure. DHS envisions the COEs as long-term trusted academic partners that provide an array of resources to help DHS achieve its missions, and carry out its operations. The COEs that make up the COE network are listed at https://www.dhs.gov/st-centers-excellence. The new Critical Infrastructure Resilience Center will be a fully-integrated component of the COE network and will take advantage of the network's resources to develop mission-critical research, education, and technology transition programs.

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor. It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area.

The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post. If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place. Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete. Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact. The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>.Questions concerning this buy must be submitted to the Purchasing Agent, Deborah Sosa, not the Accounts Receivable Officer, or the "ship to" office.
