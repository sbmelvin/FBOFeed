<DESC><p>The Infrared Space Systems Directorate (IS) Program Office intends to release Request for Proposal number FA8810-12-C-0002, P00001 for the Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) GEO 5-6 Production no earlier than 20 August 2012. It is the Government's intent to contract with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) for this effort under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p>The contract type will primarily be Fixed-Priced Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF). The intended contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1212. The IS Program Office has contracted with LMSSC over the last 16 years. LMSSC is the original and the only responsible prime source that can deliver the required services. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays; therefore, there are no viable options to obtaining competition for this procurement.</p>
<p>The SBIRS constellation consists of geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites and highly elliptical orbit (HEO) payloads. Its mission is to warn against global and theater ballistic missile attacks. Presently, the SBIRS program includes four GEO space vehicles (SV) and four HEO payloads in procurement under the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and SBIRS Follow-on Production (SFP) contracts. In order to support a future SBIRS GEO 5-6 acquisition, this particular contract action will complete the production of two GEO space vehicles following Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Advanced Procurement (AP) for various subsystems and components. There are nine (9) priced options on this contract action: Contractor Operations Support (KOS); Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) Modification; Dual Band Commanding Upgrade; GPS-M Code Upgrade; Space Vehicle Storage; Acoustic Testing; Engineering Studies; Production Studies; and Data Rights. The KOS priced option will provide the Contractor Operators during launch and early on-orbit testing should the government require its support. The SABRS priced option will integrate the design from the Advanced Procurement contract to incorporate the SABRS payload onto the SBIRS GEO 5-6 space vehicles.

<CONTACT>Michael E. Lebrun, Phone 7037049308, Email michael.e.lebrun2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Market Survey for <br />Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) systems<br /><br />This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as Request for Task Execution Plan (RTEP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, and Performance Specification. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same.
<p><br />The Army is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available commercial products and technologies that are capable of providing Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) Radar systems. The Army is primarily interested in products with technologically mature sensor systems and/or a commercial off the shelf (COTS) sensor solutions consisting of hardware, firmware, and software that will provide high resolution day/night visibility with automated detection features that enhance the Army's Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolio, can be put into service with minimal training, and increases operator effectiveness. Salient and desired characteristics of the GMTI Radar system include: Sector coverage for detection, monitoring and tracking capability against mounted and dismounted targets of interest out to 10 kilometers range in a day/night environment with alerts to prompt slew-to-cue of optical sensor to area of interest or to an area of interest identified by the operator; Scan rate adequate to detect and track individuals and vehicles between points of interest and provide alerts that allow other sensors to assess moving personnel and vehicles within the detection area. Scan area selectable by the user to optimize the detection scan to the surrounding terrain, to filter out high traffic areas or areas under continuous surveillance by other systems, and to focus detection scan on areas of interest. The system must output GMTI detection data in STANAG 4607 so that data may be ingested by local operations centers.</p>
<p>Preferred mounting of sensor would be to existing Base Expeditionary Targeting Surveillance System -Combined (BETSS-C) or Legacy Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) 80 or 107 foot tower, but is not required. The system must be operable by a skill level 1 soldier that has some knowledge/training of ISR equipment currently fielded in Afghanistan or other South West Asia (SWA) theaters of operation. In the event the Army determines that commercial solutions are feasible, it will be necessary to assess industry's ability to commence high rate monthly production within 3 months from contract award leading to delivery and platform installation of a notional quantity of 100 or more systems on or before the end of 2nd Quarter 2013.<br />Interested sources are requested to provide complete descriptions of existing products or products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above. Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that their system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness. Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact high rate production in an accelerated environment. Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments. Industry responses should include a Microsoft Project Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) with projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor, critical program events, and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices assuming a notional 1 November 2012 award date.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are due by 1700 hours on 9 November 2012. Technical questions and industry responses to this RFI are to be sent via email to Michael Lebrun at michael.e.lebrun2.civ@mail.mil. All material submitted in response to this market survey must be unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing:</p>
<p>1. Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets <br />2. Technical and management approach for executing a GMTI Radar solution to include a detailed design; procurement of subsystems and components and the integration of sensor components onto existing tower systems; rigorous contractor test and integration data; supporting technical documentation; and, operation and sustainment considerations. Responders should also fill out the attached parametric chart for their proposed sensor solutions<br />3. A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to meet or exceed the notional requirements outlined above.<br />4. A supporting program schedule that represents a "low risk" approach to meeting the objectives outlined above.<br />5. An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches.<br />6. Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information.<br />7. Will the Vendor be able to have a complete "Production Representative" Unit available to demonstrate at FT. Huachuca, AZ? YES or NO.</p>
<p>Commencing 1 December 2012, the Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the government's feasibility assessment. It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 2 hours and will be held at Fort Belvoir, VA.</p>
<p>Additionally, the government may allow interested parties an opportunity to provide a demonstration of their GMTI Radar solution integrated onto a government provided tower specification(s) to be provided under separate cover] in a field environment. It is anticipated that the demonstrations would take place at Ft. Huachuca, AZ over a 3 day period in the mid January to mid February 2013 timeframe. Participation in this demonstration will be entirely voluntary and any expense associated with a decision to participate will be borne entirely by the company. All participants in the demonstration must be US citizens and have at a minimum, a SECRET security clearance. Prior to the demonstration, participants will be required to provide a one day training session for operators of the sensor and will be required to execute a product demonstration liability disclaimer. The demonstration is a continuation of this market research effort and is being used for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Participation in the demonstration and any results gathered there from will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor participation in the demonstration. The contractor grants the government unrestricted rights to use any data gathered during the demonstration for use in assessing the feasibility of proceeding with a GMTI system acquisition strategy. This announcement concerning a GMTI Radar product demonstration does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The contractor is solely responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information provided to the government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information, product demonstration or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this market survey. At its sole discretion the government may provide participants with an informal written assessment of the capabilities demonstrated during this phase of the market research. The Government will not provide a full system capability debrief or assessment of the systems performance at the conclusion of the demonstration.<br />&emsp;<br />Parameter Example System Value Response System Value<br />Range Coverage Per Mode Ex: Mode1-100m - 3000m; Mode2 - 3000m - 15000m <br />Range Resolution Per Mode Ex: Mode1-5m; Mode2-10m <br />TLE50 Ex: 50m @ 10 km <br />MDV List in m/s <br />Scan Rate per mode* Ex: Mode1 - 15 deg/s; Mode2 - 5 deg/s <br />Scan Type Ex: mechanical, rotating (continuous - slip ring) <br />Sector Scan Capable?

<DESC>*THIS NOTICE SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUSLY ISSUED NOTICES FOR SOLICITATION #HQ0276-12-R-0001.
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to conduct an other than full and open competition (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy Agency requirements). The Government intends to conduct a limited competition among Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for the product development and initial production phase of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block (Blk) IIB Missiles. Other potential offerors (prime contractors only) will need to respond within 30 days from posting date with their intent to propose and provide a capability statement demonstrating prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense missiles; experience in land and/or sea-based missile system integration; and demonstrated missile production and sustainment capability. The Government intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 for limited competition.</p>
<p>For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the final solicitation will be released in the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, with a contract award in the second quarter of FY 2015. At this time, there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to award to United States (U.S.) owned companies only.</p>
<p>The MDA is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System and integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the U.S., friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 Blk IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2022 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U.S. homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. homeland. The SM-3 Blk IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 Blk IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 Blk IIB will be launched using engage on remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance network. The SM-3Blk IIB is required to be both land and sea compliant and is targeted for incorporation into Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria has been developed to guide prospective offeror(s) as to the priorities applied to the evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.</p>
<p>1. ICBM defense performance*<br />1.1. Defended area of U.S. homeland<br />1.2. Launch area denied<br />1.3. Level of protection <br />1.4. Maximize Government-defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture<br />1.5. Maximize reliability<br />* See paragraph CLASSIFIED ATTACHMENTS below, which describe how to request additional information.</p>
<p>2. Minimized life cycle cost<br />2.1. Minimize modifications to Aegis Weapon System<br />2.2. Simplicity of design for operations and sustainment<br />2.3. Minimize unit cost<br />2.4. Minimize fleet management cost of ICBM interceptors</p>
<p>3. Schedule realism</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate technical, management, past performance, and cost proposals.</p>

<DESC>Light Duty Road Speed Fan
In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is seeking to procure a Light Duty Road Speed Fan.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency is mandated to measure fuel economy and emissions from light duty (LD) vehicles.  These measurements are conducted on chassis dynamometers that simulate road loads including aerodynamic drag.  Cooling airflow over the vehicle is currently simulated with fixed speed fans.  These fans work well under most circumstances.  However, newer vehicles are becoming more sensitive to cooling which then impacts fuel economy and emissions.  To more realistically evaluate the performance of these new vehicles, NVFEL seeks to purchase a Road Speed Fan that modulates the air velocity with the road speed simulated by the dynamometer.  The air flow across the vehicle would then rise and fall more like it would if the vehicle were driving on the road.  
The contractor shall have total system responsibility, which includes, but is not limited to:  integration, quality assurance, delivery, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, warranty, and training.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards.
This procurement will be conducted utilizing Full and Open Competition under NAICS Code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.  Award will be made using ?Best Value? evaluation criteria.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation should be issued on or about November 19, 2012 on EPA website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  Questions may be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Debbie Lewis via email at lewis.debbie@epa.gov.

THE RFP/SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME. THIS NOTICE IS TO MAKE POTENTIAL OFFERORS AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD PLAN FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to award a single contract for the EDGAR system. The base period will be for three (3) years and there will be five (5) option periods of one (1) year each.</p>
<p>EDGAR is a system developed to automate the filing, processing and dissemination of some 125 million pages of registration statements, reports and other filings received by the SEC each year. These submissions currently are received from over 28,000 registered entities and hundreds of thousands of individual filers.</p>
<p>EDGAR was designed as a stand-alone system to include all hardware, applications, and systems software. Contractor support services are currently being used for development of new functionality, systems operation and monitoring, and for hardware and software maintenance.</p>
<p>The major processes of the electronic filing life cycle supported by EDGAR are the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Preparation and submission by filers;<br />&bull; Receipt and acceptance by SEC;<br />&bull; Data storage and retrieval;<br />&bull; Data dissemination to the public; and<br />&bull; Analysis and review by SEC staff.</p>
<p>This acquisition shall include modernization of the entire EDGAR system to include business process transformations for simplifying the current interfaces and functionality, providing support tools for SEC staff, and continuing to utilize web-based, user friendly technology to make filing easier, dissemination faster and cheaper, and further secure the entire process. Additional pertinent information:</p>
<p>&bull; This solicitation shall be awarded for a three (3) year period of performance with five (5) option periods of one (1) year (for a total of eight (8) years);<br />&bull; Dissemination subscription fees for all three (3) contract years and all option years will be specified at the time of contract award and be subject to future modifications;<br />&bull; Revenues derived from sale of dissemination services shall be used to pay for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the Dissemination Subsystem; and<br />&bull; During the first 120 days of this contract, the SEC will curtail development efforts of new functionality to allow proper transition, however, it is expected that any development activity in the pipeline will also be transitioned during this period so that development may resume during the transition period. This does not apply to priority one bug fixes during the transition period.</p>
<p>Draft RFP Sections C &amp; F and attachments F1, F3, &amp; F7 are attached for review.</p>

<SUBJECT>Intent to Award Sole Source - Advisory and Assistance Services for CFTC's Division of Market Oversight
<SOLNBR>CFDMO-13-SO-0068
<RESPDATE>111612
<CONTACT>William M Roberson, Phone 202-418-5367, Fax 202-418-5414, Email wroberson@cftc.gov
<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") intends to procure the services of Harvey Theberge, on a sole source basis, for a two year contract for advisory and assistance services in connection with the ongoing expansion of the Commission's Division of Market Oversight's (DMO) market continuity examinations program, required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Automated systems play a central and critical role in the modern, predominantly electronic, futures trading environment. They will also play a critical role in the swaps market which the Commission has been charged to regulate by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Effective oversight of system safeguards therefore is central to the mission of the Commission. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes substantial new system safeguards requirements for all swap execution facilities (SEFs) and swap data repositories (SDRs). Each SEF and SDR will be required to maintain a program of risk analysis and oversight that addresses information security, business continuity-disaster recovery (BC-DR) planning and resources, capacity and performance planning, systems operations, systems development and quality assurance, and physical security and environmental controls. Each SEF and SDR must have automated systems that are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. Each SEF and SDR must also maintain emergency procedures, backup facilities, and a plan for disaster recovery that allow for the timely recovery and resumption of operations, and periodically conduct tests to verify that backup resources are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of the entity's obligations under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act also established expanded, updated, and detailed system safeguards requirements for all designated contract markets (DCMs). Like SEFs and SDRs, each DCM must maintain a program of risk analysis and oversight that addresses information security, business continuity-disaster recovery (BC-DR) planning and resources, capacity and performance planning, systems operations, systems development and quality assurance, and physical security and environmental controls. Each DCM must have automated systems that are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. Each DCM must also maintain emergency procedures, backup facilities, and a plan for disaster recovery that allow for the timely recovery and resumption of operations, and periodically conduct tests to verify that backup resources are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of the entity's obligations under the CEA and Commission regulations. CFTC requires contractor support for the extension and adaptation of the examinations program related to market continuity and system safeguards pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as ongoing technical support of the DMO Examinations Group program related to market continuity and system safeguards for DCMs, SEFs and SDRs. For at least the next two years, and until the number of DMO's systems risk analysts can be substantially increased, this required work cannot be performed without the assistance of a highly qualified contractor who has substantial experience with DMO's system safeguards examinations process and DMO's designation and registration review processes. The contractor is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform the required work. His extensive experience places him in a unique position to provide services needed by the Commission in connection with its expanding responsibilities for oversight of both futures and swaps, and in connection with the need for increased oversight of high frequency trading. During the past three and one-half years, Mr. Theberge has played a principal role as a contractor in developing the Commission's market continuity program in the DMO's Examinations Group, which is designed to conduct regular examinations of compliance with system safeguards core principles and regulations for the automated systems of not only DCMs and DCOs, but also the SEFs and SDRs created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. He has extensive and unique experience in conducting system safeguards examinations, and with conducting reviews of applicants for designation as DCMs and registration as SDRs or SEFs. In addition, Mr. Theberge played a central role in assisting the Commission in developing possible requirements for exchanges that offer co-location and/or proximity hosting services, particularly in the area of latency transparency, and has devoted a significant amount of time and effort in building expertise in this area through research and discussion with major industry participants and providers. His knowledge in this area will be particularly valuable as the Commission moves forward with its efforts to understand and provide enhanced oversight of high frequency trading at DCMs and SEFs. Additionally, the contractor developed the Commission's existing program for conducting technical reviews of applicants for designation as an exchange. He was also the sole provider of reviews of the systems planned by new applicants for designation, and has regularly acted as a consultant to CFTC attorneys on technical matters in rule enforcement reviews for the past 12 years. Due to the unique qualifications of Harvey Theberge, and the results of past related notices posted in FedBizOpps, CFTC believes that no other qualified source exists for this work. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the response date and time identified in this notice. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.

<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement.

<p>The Government anticipates posting the U.S. Mission Germany solicitation on this site approximately fifteen (15) days after the pre-solicitation conference. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda N. Rogers at rogersan@state.gov PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>May 2012 Consolidation
The May consolidation will be posted to FBO by cob November 1, 2012.  In order to move forward with the May consolidation, language regarding standardization has been removed.  This announcement will mirror the previous consolidation postings with a few exceptions.  Questions regarding VHA's standardization initiative may be directed to Mr. Kurt Finke, Director Healthcare Technology Management at kurt.finke@va.gov or 612-467-5778.
 Changes to the HTME Staff and consolidation process are as follows:
1.	 HTME Team Members : 
a.	I am pleased to introduce two new HTME employees.  Mr. Morgan Ward is an Equipment Specialist with 20 years of experience as a Biomedical Engineer from North Chicago VA and Great Lakes Navel Hospital.   Mr. Bryan O'Shaughnessy is a FAC Level 2 Contract Specialist from the Department of Energy with over 10 years contracting experience.  Please join me in welcoming Morgan and Bryan to the team.  
b.	Effective November 19, 2012, the PACs program will be transferred to the Medical/Surgical team under the supervision of Mr. Ron Jenkins.  Mr. Jenkins can be reached on Ronald.jenkins3@va.gov or 708-786-4929. Senior Contract Specialist Mr. Eric Lee will continue to lead the PACs program under the Medical Surgical team.  Please continue to contact Mr. Bruce Jackson, bruce.jackson@va.gov, with questions regarding the HTME consolidation.  
c.	 Ms. Coretta Daniels is a temporary staff member who will assist with receiving reports, invoice payments, inspections, etc.
d.	An updated employee matrix will be distributed in the near future.

2.	May 2012 Consolidation Schedule:
a.	November 1, 2012 - Post Requirements to FBO
b.	December 10, 2012 - RFQ incorporates a time period for vendor questions and Government responses.   Deadline for receipt of Vendor Questions; email your questions to AMMHIN HTME Vendors or Vendors@va.gov. 
c.	January 15, 2013 - Deadline to submit quotes to HTME
d.	June 30, 2013 - Goal to award all Delivery Orders 

3.	Vendors:
a.	RFQ Instructions to Offerors:  Revisions are outlined in Bold.
b.	Submit the following information to Ms. Coretta Daniels at coretta.daniels@va.gov 
i.	Contract Administrator:  Provide the name, address and email of the current contract administrator.  This information is needed to ensure information is properly distributed.
ii.	Provide the name and email address of the individuals to be included on the email notifications regarding the consolidation.

c.	 Vendor Communications:   We have advised our customers that during the market research phase of the procurement, communications between the Government facility and the vendors are strongly encouraged within the guidelines provided by their Contracting Officer and in accordance with FAR Part 10.001(2) (iii).  During this phase, there is a more free flow of information, but this should be viewed as an opportunity to understand vendors' capabilities to meet their needs.   Vendors should have equal access to the facility during this time, e.g. site visits, vendor demonstrations, etc.  Customers must ensure that the information provided to one vendor on their requirement is provided to all. 
i.	Following the November 1, 2012 FBO posting, the local Contracting Officer serves as the focal point for all vendor inquiries.  However, following the closing date to receive quotes at the NAC (1/15/13), stations should have no further communication with the vendors regarding the May consolidation.  Unless the local Contracting Officer requires clarification or additional information to complete the evaluation, all communications are through the NAC Contracting Officer.
ii.	Market research may continue on Equipment targeted for the September 2012 Consolidation until that respective FBO posting. We have not established a target date to post the September 2012 RFQ; however, many of our customers are expected to attend The Radiological Society of North America conference in Chicago later this year to continue their market research efforts for the September 2012 consolidation.  

d.	 The NAC Contracting Officers will review the station's recommended source selection justifications and determine whether or not the justification is adequate to execute the award or will request additional information from the station before an award can be executed.  Communication during this time will be through NAC Contracting Officers only.  We have advised our customers that when the selection process begins there is to be no further contact with vendors regarding their requirements.  Disclosing information such as members of the evaluation panel is considered confidential source selection information and may not be disclosed.

e.	 In order to ensure all vendors are treated fairly, we have asked customers to ensure their Contracting Officers are aware of all vendor site visits. We also ask that vendors forward the above information to their respective sales team so that all are aware of the process and timelines. 

A monthly update of vendor selections will be provided following final delivery order award.  We also ask that you do not contact the Contracting Officers or Mr. Jackson regarding the status of selections.  This will only delay the process.  

Finally, we appreciate your patience as we endeavor to move our customer's requirements forward and ensure adherence to federal regulations.

Sincerely,


Sandra Perkins
Chief, High Technology Medical Equipment Division

<DESC>VA Request For Information for a Web and Mobile Imaging Solution

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.   Any and all information requested in response to this RFI is for Market Research purposes only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor.  All submissions to this RFI will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned. Items in appendix A and B provide the current business requirements and appendix C addresses specific information that is desired as part of the RFI. 

Background 

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the largest integrated health delivery system in the United States, delivering comprehensive care to approximately six million Veterans through a network of health care facilities owned and staffed by VA, academic medical affiliates and other contracted providers, contracted networks, and episodic fee-for-service purchases which administer 152 health care systems (HCSs) and medical centers (VAMCs), 974 Outpatient Clinics - most of which are extensions of a parent HCS/VAMC - and 133 Community Living Centers which deliver skilled nursing and extended care.  VHA sites of care are distributed across the United States, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with additional clinics in American Samoa, and Guam. 

Connecting this network into a meaningful and seamless healthcare system in which Veterans receive the right care no matter where they are in relation to the system's resources is critical in meeting the needs of Veterans.  New technology geared to improve how VHA's health care system connects and reducing the effects of geographic disparity is growing and presents an opportunity to increase VHA's ability to connect patients, healthcare providers and the data they need to interact in a meaningful way. An example of these new technologies are applications that allow the viewing of medical images on mobile platforms that can expedite diagnosis and treatment planning, facilitating communication among radiologists and referring clinicians.
The VA recently defined its requirements for web and mobile access to medical imaging to enable VA care providers and their patient's timely, convenient access to medical imaging information and in alignment and support of VA's strategic objectives:
"	Enhance the Veteran experience and access to health care
"	Establish strong VA management infrastructure and integrated operating model
"	Health Care Efficiency: Improve the quality of health care while reducing cost
"	Transform health care delivery through health informatics
This initiative also enables and accounts for several significant technical and workflow considerations:
1.	Accessibility: Providing a browser, platform and PACS agnostic web and mobile imaging solution
2.	Acceptance: Providing an FDA, cleared for diagnosis solution for both web and mobile imaging
3.	Security: Provide a secure environment for a web and mobile imaging solution.  Where patient data is protected at all times, the applications adhere to strict IT policies and personal devices can be centrally managed 
4.	Performance: Provide a state of the art imaging platform that includes basic imaging needs all the way to the advanced user.  The solution will perform under a variety of network restrictions but maintain the optimal performance for the user.
5.	Collaboration: Provide a solution that allows true real-time collaboration amongst geographically spread users.  Providing the highest of patient care in an ever changing healthcare environment.

Purpose 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Veterans Health Administration in determining the potential level of interest and technical capabilities within the commercial sector and the full extent of the requirements for a mobile medical image viewer application.
Vision
VHA's vision is to implement an application that will allow for the viewing of clinical images stored in VISTA imaging on mobile devices. VHA requirements for the application are set forth in Appendix A and B to this notice.

?
Appendix A:  Functional Business Requirements for Imaging Mobile Application
Business Requirements for Imaging Mobile Application
Business Need: Provide Mobile Device-based Viewing of Images

<DESC><p>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Although "proposal" and "offertory" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. The AFLCMC's Special Operations Forces and Personnel Recovery Division of the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Directorate is soliciting information to identify possible sources for the development of AC-130J Stand-Alone PSP maintenance technical orders (TOs) and flight manuals (FMs) to support the PSP currently under development. The PSP incorporates a Mission Operator Pallet (MOP) consisting of the medium caliber gun with trainable gun mount, multiple Standoff-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGMs), internal crew member and external communications, Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data links, Line of Sight (LOS) data links, multiple Electrical Optical /Infrared (EO/IR) sensors onto an existing donor aircraft, in this case a MC-130J, creating an AC-130J. Additionally, provisions will be added to the AC-130J to integrate carry-on operational equipment. Additional provisions will consist of connections to operate carry-on equipment through established aircraft avionics and communication systems. The MOP hosts the battle management system and fire control system software to operate all PSP mission equipment. All PSP equipment is managed through the MOP to identify, track and engage targets. The primary objective for the maintenance TOs is to enable maintenance technicians to maintain and functionally check the PSP to ensure mission effectiveness. The primary objective for the FMs for the PSP is to enable the flight crew to operate the PSP in training or combat environments.</p>
<p>3. TO and FM core requirements:</p>
<p>a. Contractor shall identify, develop and provide Stand-Alone AC-130J PSP maintenance TOs and FMs for all PSP data based upon aircraft final design concept. <br />b.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please see attached Sources Sought Synopsis for full details.</span></strong> <br />
<p>1. Sources Sought Synopsis for Planning Purposes. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to perform market research, and to determine offeror interest and capability in providing combined F-15C/E MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</p>
<p>a. Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify companies, as potential sources, that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide F-15C and F-15E military flight simulator services for the F-15C and F-15E Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of existing MTC simulator service contracts (currently projected to end in July 2016 and September 2017, respectively). Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. There are currently two separate contracts for F-15C and F-15E simulators services. These services are both provided by the same contractor and this incumbent owns all simulator devices. It is the Government's intention to determine whether there is offeror interest and capability in performing a simulator service contract that combines the two services into one contract.</p>
<p>b. Please email any questions as soon as possible and your response to this Source Sought Synopsis no later than 1500 EST, 1 December 2012, to Caley Cyphers (caley.cyphers@wpafb.af.mil), Contract Negotiator. Emailed response must be received no later than the above-mentioned time/date for the Government to consider your response in formulating our market research.</p>

For those decks over which equipment, valves, piping, or other materials must be handled, the temporary protective covering shall be plywood or particle board and shall be of sufficient thickness to protect the deck from damage in the event the equipment or materials are dropped. Fit protective coverings to allow access to and operation of flush escape scuttles.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall protect all compartments, machinery, equipment, deck coverings, furnishings, vent terminals, insulation, glass, cables, electrical panels and controllers, piping systems, coatings, structures, and other ship components from damage and from entry of dust, dirt, grit, sand, and other foreign particles.</p>
<p>Whenever abrasive blasting or other operations which create atmospheric contamination are performed on or near the ship, or which could otherwise allow airborne contaminates to collect on or in the ship, the Contractor shall plug, wrap, blank, cover, or mask all openings to prevent entry of the contaminates into the ship. Install industrial foam filter material on the intake and exhaust end of ventilation systems which will be in use. Renew the filter materials when air flow becomes restricted. Whenever abrasive blasting is performed inside the ship, blast materials shall be confined to the compartment being blasted.</p>
<p>All damage and contamination resulting from failure to provide adequate protection shall be repaired and cleaned to re-establish the condition which existed at the start of the work.</p>
<p>Remove and dispose of all protective coverings after the completion of all other work.</p>
<p>13.0 DAILY CLEAN-UP</p>
<p>The Contractor shall clean-up and remove from the ship all dirt, debris, scrap, and other materials incidental to Contractor's work at the end of each work day. The work site shall be returned to its original condition.</p>
<p>Whenever abrasive blasting or other operations on or near the ship causes collection of blasting residue or other foreign particles to collect on exterior decks of the ship, the Contractor shall vacuum or sweep the decks to remove the residue and particles prior to the end of the day on which the contamination occurred. Do not wash the residue or particles through the ship's deck drains.</p>
<p>14.0 DISRUPTION OF SHIP'S SYSTEMS</p>
<p>This section is applicable after reconstruction of the vessel interior is nearly complete and NOAA acceptance of spaces has begun.</p>
<p>Except as necessary to perform work, none of the ship's fire main, electrical, steam, heating, potable water, drainage, or other systems which are vital to crew safety or comfort shall be shut off or disrupted by Contractor. The COR must be provided with advance notice of a disruption at least 4 hours in advance.</p>
<p>Disruptions shall be limited to 8-hour intervals. If the required work will need a longer interval, temporary bypass hoses, blank flanges, or piping shall be installed to keep the system in operation.</p>
<p>For purposes of this specification, a "disruption" occurs whenever a large section of a system will be unusable. If the only section of the system affected is that on which work is being performed and the remainder of the system can be operated, a "disruption" has not occurred and the requirements of this paragraph do not apply.</p>
<p>15.0 WORK HOURS</p>
<p>At the beginning of the repair period, the Contractor shall advise the COR in writing of the planned regular work day schedule. In the event the Contractor desires to work at times other than those previously scheduled, it is requested that notification is provided to the COR at least 4 hours prior to the end of the scheduled work day preceding the unscheduled work time. If previously unscheduled work is to be performed on a weekend or federal holiday, the COR shall be notified prior to 9:00 a.m. on the work day immediately before the day the unscheduled work is to be performed. NOTE: The intent of this requirement is to assure that NOAA will have the opportunity to be present during contract repairs, and not to limit the Contractor's work hours.</p>
<p>16.0 LOCAL POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES</p>
<p>While Contractor personnel are on the ship or on other government facilities, they shall comply with all policies and directives issued by the Master, Commanding Officer, or Director of the ship or facility.</p>
<p>Only a Contracting Officer may make changes to the terms and conditions of this contract. Any direction that the Contractor deems as a compensable change to the terms and conditions of this contract must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer immediately.</p>
<p>17.0 GAS FREE CERTIFICATION FOR HOT WORK AND PERSONNEL ACCESS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for certifying that a safe atmosphere exists in and about a compartment prior to the commencement of any work. Whenever compartments must be gas free to meet state and federal regulations, the Contractor shall pump down, open, remove sludge, clean, wipe, ventilate and take all other action required to make the compartments safe for the work to be performed. When requested by the Contractor, and to the extent empty tank space is available, NOAA will shift fuel as required to facilitate gas free requirements while the fuel transfer system is still operational. Off-loading of fuel, hydraulic, and lube oils stored in tanks and sumps for performance of contract work items is the responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Copies of gas free certificates, issued by a Marine Chemist certified by the National Fire Protection Association, shall be posted on the ship in two locations designated by the COR. Follow-up inspections by the Contractor shall also be documented at the same two locations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for identifying the compartments which require gas free certification.</p>
<p>18.0 FIRE WATCH STANDERS</p>
<p>Hot work is permitted only when fire watch standers are provided by the Contractor. A fire watch stander is required whenever welding, flame cutting or other hot work is performed where combustible materials are present within 35 feet; or where wall or deck openings within a 35-feet radius expose combustible materials in adjacent areas; or when combustible materials are adjacent to the opposite side of metal partitions exposed to hot work, and could be ignited by conduction or radiation. In the latter case, a fire watch stander is required on both sides of the partition.</p>
<p>Each fire watch stander shall be outfitted by the Contractor with a fire extinguisher of a suitable size and type.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving the work site, the fire watch stander shall verify with the worker performing the hot work that no further hot work will be performed.</p>
<p>Insulation, sheathing, or other materials which limit access to either side of a partition or structure on which hot work is being performed shall be considered to be interference, and shall be removed and restored by the Contractor.</p>
<p>19.0 WRITTEN HOT WORK NOTICE</p>
<p>Prior to starting hot work on any job or separate area of the ship, provide a written notice to the COR, or to the Officer on Deck when on duty. The notice shall specify the location of the work, the time hot work will commence and the current gas free status of the area if needed. The COR shall be notified by the Contractor of the hot work to be performed at the beginning of each work day.</p>
<p>20.0 MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Oxygen, acetylene, and gas supply manifold systems shall be located off the ship by the Contractor and have a shutoff valve to the gas supply located on the dock. The shutoff valve shall be in addition to the master shutoff valve at the inlet to each portable outlet header.</p>
<p>Material brought onto the ship shall be stored until used in areas which do not interfere with access to fire-fighting equipment or personnel access. Crating and packing shall be removed prior to bringing the equipment or material aboard the ship, unless needed to protect the equipment or material from damage during handling. In that case, the crating and packing shall be removed from the equipment or material, and shall be removed from the ship, immediately after being brought aboard.</p>
<p>Rigging of hoses, welding leads, and temporary lights put in place by the Contractor shall be kept clear of the decks on temporary "trees" or brackets and be arranged so as to minimize tripping and other safety hazards. Passageways shall be kept as clear of obstructions as possible.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit an Environmental Management/Compliance Plan and a Hazardous Waste/Materials plan.</p>
<p>21.0 REMOVALS</p>
<p>Whenever removal of equipment or machinery is specified, but reinstallation is not specified, the Contractor shall remove all related electric cables, brackets, foundations, and piping. Removal of cables shall be to the nearest circuit breaker or terminal not needed for operation of other equipment or machinery. Removal of piping shall include all related piping not used by other systems or equipment. Install pipe caps or blank flanges as needed to restore piping system integrity.</p>
<p>Whenever removal of piping or cables involves penetration through bulkheads, decks, hull plating or other watertight boundaries, the Contractor shall crop out the penetration and install an insert plate of same thickness as the adjacent plating. Insert plates shall be at least 6-inches in diameter, but as a minimum must comply with ABS requirements for inserting steel decks and bulkheads.</p>
<p>22.0 STRUCTURAL ACCESS OPENINGS</p>
<p>The Contractor may, with prior approval, cut access openings in ship's structure if required to perform work. Such openings shall be limited to those which are essential for access to otherwise inaccessible areas or which greatly improve accessibility for removals or installations. The method and accomplishment of access cuts in hull and watertight boundaries require ABS authorization, inspection and approval.</p>
<p>Prior to making any access opening in the ship's structure, the Contractor shall submit to the COR a sketch of the proposed opening, showing the location and dimensions of the proposed access cut, adjacent framing members, nearby penetrations, scantlings of the structure, and documentation of ABS approval when required. Generous radii shall be provided at all corners. Also include a description of the eventual restoration configuration, with material and welding details, and a narrative justification for cutting the opening. Submittal of the sketch does not insure that the COR will authorize the cut as proposed. The Contractor shall proceed with the access cut only after return by the COR of a signed copy of the sketch.</p>
<p>23.0 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>At least four hours, but not more than 24 hours, in advance of conducting each required test and inspection, notify the COR in order to allow the COR the opportunity to witness, or to arrange for another NOAA representative to witness, the tests and inspections. If the COR or other NOAA representative is not present at the scheduled time of the test or inspection, and if the required 4-hour advance notification was furnished to the COR, the Contractor may proceed with the test or inspection.</p>
<p>All tests and inspections shall be witnessed by the Contractor's supervisor responsible for the work. A Condition Found Report shall be prepared to document the results of all tests and inspections.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, all tests and inspections shall be scheduled during the normal weekday work shift. Tests and inspections may be scheduled for other times only when necessary to avoid a delay in the contract completion. When necessary to schedule a test or inspection after the normal day shift or on a weekend, the COR shall be notified of the test or inspection at least four hours before the end of the last preceding regular work shift.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform an operational test of all newly installed, overhauled, and repaired equipment to demonstrate proper operation. Shipboard equipment will be operated by the ship's crew.</p>
<p>Whenever a "hose test" is specified, the Contractor shall conduct the test by directing a 50-psig stream of water from a 1-1/2 inch fire hose through an all-purpose nozzle at a distance of not more than 10 feet from the surface being tested. Direct the stream of water in a manner most likely to disclose a leak and inspect the opposite side of the surface for leaks.</p>
<p>24.0 FUEL OIL AND LUBE OIL OFFLOADING</p>
<p>Whenever the Contractor is required to or elects to offload fuel oil or lube oil from the ship, the oil shall be pumped to and stored in clean moisture-free storage tanks. Meter the oils with a calibrated meter during offloading and during return. Take test samples during offloading and during return, and have the test samples analyzed by a lab for water and impurities to verify that the oils were not contaminated while in the Contractor's possession. Provide copies of lab reports to the COR.</p>
<p>After all work which necessitated the oil's removal has been completed, the Contractor shall return the oil to the ship. In lieu of storing the oil, the Contractor may accept title and responsibility for disposal of the oil and provide an equal amount of new clean oil, same as that removed. Test samples are required, even if this option is exercised by the Contractor.</p>
<p>25.0 DISPOSAL OF FLUIDS</p>
<p>Whenever work requires that equipment, machinery, piping, or tanks be drained of fluids, the Contractor shall be responsible for the draining and proper disposal of the fluids. In the event that the Contractor drains the fluid into the ship's bilges, the Contractor shall pump all fluids from the applicable bilges into dockside tanks and properly dispose of the fluids. The Contractor shall also properly dispose of those fluids that have accumulated prior to the time, and between the time, that the equipment, machinery, piping or tanks were drained and such time that the bilges have been pumped dry by the Contractor.</p>
<p>26.0 WATER DEPTHS AND HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS</p>
<p>At no time will the ship be moored at any dock or transit any waterway which has a water depth less than that required to provide a minimum clearance of one foot under the lowest underwater projection.</p>
<p>The minimum liquid load, drafts and displacement of the ship at which the government intends to transit and arrive at the Contractor's facility will be provided upon request prior to arrival. Also included will be information concerning any changes in the ships liquid load which the Contractor will be permitted to make in order to meet the minimum underwater clearance requirements.</p>
<p>At no time will the ship transit a waterway which has non-opening bridge or other overhead structure that would cause less than one-foot clearance over the ship's highest projection. In order to permit passage of the ship under bridges or other overhead structures in the waterway, the government will lower masts which have hinged connections for that purpose. However, the government will not remove, and will not permit the Contractor to remove, any part of the ship's structure or equipment for the purpose of providing the required overhead clearance.</p>
<p>27.0 DISASSEMBLY AND INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Whenever equipment, machinery, systems, or other system components are required to be disassembled, opened or overhauled, the Contractor shall complete all disassembling and inspections during the first 25-percent of the work performance period. All tanks required to be opened shall also be opened and gas-freed during the first 25-percent of the work performance period. No time extension of the work performance period will be granted for delays caused by the Contractor's failure to comply with this 25-percent time requirement.</p>
<p>28.0 ENGINE ROOM BILGE CLEANING</p>
<p>During the week of the repair period, the Contractor shall pump and properly dispose of all oily water from the engine room bilges and clean bilges as required for hot work. At the completion of all repair contract work, clean the engine room bilges by flushing with a fresh water and detergent solution (to remove all oil and other debris) and pump the bilges dry. If bilges are already clean upon arrival at the Contractor's facility, the cleaning of the engine room bilges may be deferred to a later time during contract or waived at the discretion of the COR.</p>
<p>29.0 WEIGHT AND STABILITY</p>
<p>Throughout the performance period of the repair contract, the Contractor shall track the weight changes to the vessel resulting from the work items in the repair contract. The location and amount of the weight shall be recorded for both removals and additions including the differences between equipment being replaced with new equipment. The current record of weight changes shall be provided to the COR at each weekly progress meeting with the total itemized record to be provided at the contract completion date. The weight record shall be the actual recorded weight and not an estimate, utilizing certified weighing devices. The Contractor may use the load cell for the shipyard crane to estimate weight transfers to and from the ship. The intent is to have an accurate count to provide to the design agent who will accomplish the stability test report post repair period.</p>
<p>30.0 FINAL CLEANUP OF VESSEL</p>
<p>The Contractor shall clean all deck surfaces and wash tile decking. Clean all dirt from exterior decks and wash down exterior decks.</p>
<p>31.0 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS</p>

The Quality Control Program shall be described in a written plan.</p>
<p>The Government will review and either approve of or note deficiencies / issues with the submitted plan within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt. Once approved, the Contractor shall abide by this plan throughout the performance period of the contract, unless otherwise updated and approved.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the Contractor's Quality Control Plan shall include:<br />(a) A specific dedicated section that addresses quality control as it relates to the statement of work / specifications of the contract;<br />(b) An internal quality control and inspection system for the completion of the requirement;<br />(c) The job titles and organizational positions of the individuals who will conduct the inspections must be specified;<br />(d) Procedures and methodology for identifying potential problems and deficiencies in services, reporting of issues, resolutions, and ensuring they do not re-occur;<br />(e) Procedures to correct any deficiency in products or services that may occur;<br />(f) A file of information (which shall be made available to the Government, upon request) regarding inspection and other quality and internal control actions that documents the purpose of the inspection, the results of the inspection, and any corrective action taken as a result of the inspection; and<br />(g) A requirement that the Contractor shall record and report all end-user identified complaints and resolutions to the COR on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>The Government may require that the Quality Control Plan be updated during the performance of the contract should a deficiency in the plan be identified. In the event of any changes to the Quality Control Plan, a revised copy of the plan shall be submitted by the Contractor to the COR within 5 (five) business days prior to the effective date of the change for approval.</p>
<p>A fixed-price multiple award schedule IDIQ type contract is anticipated. The Contract(s) performance period is contemplated to be a base period of one year, with four option periods of one year.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. The request does not obligate the government to any contract award. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is issuing this Sources Sought announcement for Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Injection Systems to determine interest, availability and capability of business to perform the work as described below. The location of the work is in the Savannah River, Chatham County, Georgia. There are two specific locations for the DO systems. The first location is on property adjacent the Plant McIntosh in Effingham County, Georgia, and the second is on property adjacent to International Paper (IP) on Hutchinson Island in Chatham County, Georgia. At the Hutchinson Island location, the DO would be injected into both the Savannah River and the Back River, both located in the State of Georgia.
<p>This announcement is part of our market research, and responses are sought to identify sources that have the knowledge, skills, and capability to perform the work. Interested contractors, including the following NAICS Codes: 237110 - Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction; 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services; 333318 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing or any other related NAICS codes&nbsp;are hereby invited to submit a response to demonstrate their technical, managerial, and business capability to provide the requested services. The estimated value of this work will be less than $10 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The proposed plan for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is to deepen the navigation channel to a depth of -47 feet. Appendix Z of the Environmental Impact Statement explains that this will have an adverse impact on the dissolved oxygen levels in the harbor. In order to minimize these adverse effects, the Corps of Engineers (COE) plans to use a Dissolved Oxygen Injection System (USACE, 2012).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: All components of the systems must be constructed of materials durable in the marine environment and will not have detrimental effects on aquatic life. The injection system must be land-based, in order to meet the site-specific requirements. The system must be capable of diffusing 40,000 lbs/day of oxygenated water, achieve high oxygen absorption efficiency at shallow depths, ensure quick depressurization/dilution/mixing of the highly oxygenated water to prevent the potential for effervescence, and have the capability to efficiently dissolve pure oxygen as well as produce a highly superoxygenated discharge. The water intake and diffusion structures are to include screens appropriately sized to keep flow velocities from exceeding 0.5 ft/sec. The system CANNOT interfere with the navigation channel or require the installation of equipment below -100 ft. of the mean lower low water. The system must also operate independently without onsite personnel.</p>
<p>All interested firms with 237110, 541330, 333318 as approved NAICS codes and any other related NAICS codes have until 16 November 2012 at 2:00pm to submit the following information:</p>
<p>Name, address and DUNs number of your Firm</p>
<p>Point of Contact (name/phone/email)</p>
<p>Project information sheets providing evidence of capabilities to perform comparable work on two (2) and no more than (5) recent projects. Projects submitted should be no more than six (6) years old have a value of at least $2M. Include the project name and description of the key/salient features of the project, completion date, total value and your company's level of involvement in the project, i.e. subcontractor (type), prime, specific role etc. Additionally, if you were teaming with another firm, clearly identify your role on the project(s) submitted. Please provide at least one point of contact (with email address and phone number) for project validation. The Government will not give credit to projects if the lack of information hinders the ability to determine relevancy and/or level of experience.</p>
<p>Contractual questions should be forwarded to Whittni Wright at whittni.c.wright@usace.army.mil. <br />The requested information shall be submitted hard copy along with one (1) copy of CD-ROM via FEDEX or UPS to:</p>

<DESC>R--Sources Sought for Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services
<p>Solicitation Number: W912DY13RUES6<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville</p>
<p>Classification Code:<br />R -- Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />221122 Electric Power Distribution<br />221210 Natural Gas Distribution<br />221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) project for the Government's U.S. Army Reserve Center (USARC) installation located on the U.S. Pacific Territory, American Samoa.</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.</p>
<p>- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.</p>
<p>3. Project Information: The requirement at USARC American Samoa may include but not be limited to exterior roof insulation with blown on HFC (organic compounds, zero-ozone depleting) liquid spray system that cures to a rigid polyurethane insulation with an acrylic finish coat, installation of an appropriately sized photovoltaic system to achieve net zero use as practical and solar hot water heat, possible installation of a small wind turbine for electric production, installation of energy efficient lighting, installation of improved HVAC system, window and door replacement with tinted energy efficient products, installation of motion sensors, design and installaton of a rainwater catchment system to provide potable and non-potable drinking water that will collect, store and treat the potable water to achieve the EPA standards for safe drinking water.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

<DESC>R--Sources Sought for Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services
<p>Solicitation Number: W912DY13RUES3<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville</p>
<p>Classification Code:<br />R -- Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />221122 Electric Power Distribution<br />221210 Natural Gas Distribution<br />221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) project for the Government's U.S. Army Reserve Center (USARC) installation located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.</p>
<p>- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.</p>
<p>3. Project Information: The requirement at USARC JBER may include but not be limited to building envelope improvements to include roof work and improving facility insulation, installation of improved energy efficient lighting, installation of motion sensors, and updates to the HVAC and controls.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

<DESC>R--Sources Sought for Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services
<p>Solicitation Number: W912DY13RUES5<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville</p>
<p>Classification Code:<br />R -- Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Codes:<br />221122 Electric Power Distribution<br />221210 Natural Gas Distribution<br />221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, states the head of each agency shall improve energy efficiency by 3% annually or 30% in total by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to each agency's fiscal year 2003 energy use baseline. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) project for the Government's U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Maui High Performance computing Center (MHPCC), in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii.</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.</p>
<p>- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Requirement: A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct a 1.75MW photovoltaic electricity generating system and provide assurance the system will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 10-year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing if necessary. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.</p>
<p>3. Project Information: The requirement at US AFRL MHPCC included installation of photovoltaic equipment to generate 1.75MW of electrical power generation.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Your firm's response is requested no later than 4:00 Central Time, Monday, December 17, 2012. Send responses by email to barbara.l.osterkamp@usace.army.mil and michelle.toney@usace.army.mil.

The contractor maintains, manages and utilizes one-of-a-kind instrumentation systems, which are predominantly computer driven and frequently involve complex modeling/simulation/stimulation. The contract will involve major efforts in system integration, system and software engineering, data collection, data reduction, data management, motor pool operations, equipment maintenance, and test support services in an other than office environment.  Support occurs at all phases of the USAOTC world-wide mission (e.g., pre-test planning, test execution, and post-test activities).  The new contract will also cover the potential need for support to multiple locations within the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska and Hawaii. The contractor will be provided Government-Furnished Facilities (GFF) at West Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. <br><br>Verbal requests will not be entertained regarding any information in this announcement.  All inquiries must be submitted in writing.    The DRFP and subsequent final RFP will be posted to the following website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ .<br><br>The Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held on October 10, 2012 beginning at 8:00 AM in building 91010 on West Fort Hood, Texas.  An agenda will be provided at the conference.  The purpose of the conference is to provide information on the mission and operations of the USAOTC and to give potential respondents an opportunity to seek clarification on the performance based work statement and other provisions of the DRFP.  Offerors desiring to participate in the pre-solicitation conference are required to pre-register by emailing worner.o.heath.civ@mail.mil or calling 254-287-2555 not later than close of business on 5 October 2012.  Directions will be provided in the DRFP.  Offerors are required to follow-up with a list of attendees to include name, title and telephone number.  Lists may be e-mailed to worner.o.heath.civ@mail.mil .  Attendance is limited to four (4) individuals per offeror.  <br><br>This synopsis also invites interested respondents to submit information regarding possible Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) that will allow the Government to advise respondents about their potential to be viable competitors.  The advisory opinion will contain sufficient information for interested respondents to make informed decisions about their participation in the acquisition.  Each respondent will be advised that either it is considered to be a viable competitor for the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Respondents considered not to be viable competitors will be provided the general basis for the opinion.  In order to receive an OCI advisory opinion the following information shall be provided not later than 12 October 2012 to the e-mail address below.<br><br>The respondents shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, a copy of Scope of Work of the Performance Work Statement to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Respondents shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  Included shall be an electronic copy of your company's latest annual report to stockholders since this document discusses the company's involvement in various programs.  The respondent shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  In the context of OCI, involvement is defined as any participation or connection to a project, contract, program, or product which may create actual or perceived OCI.  This includes participation in contracts that provide engineering or technical support to sponsors or program offices responsible for developing such systems. The Contracting Officer will review statements provided by each respondent as to the developmental work the company has performed; evaluate the submittals considering in-house knowledge as to the company's program support; determine whether or not there is an OCI on a case-by-case basis. This must include all subcontractors.  Subcontractor OCI is equivalent to a prime contractor OCI.   Failure to provide the required information will be deemed non-responsive; incomplete submissions will not be considered and no opinion will be provided.  <br><br>Interested parties should submit their OCI information to the Contracting Specialist worner.o.heath.civ@mail.mil . The file shall be submitted in a format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office (2007 or earlier) and is limited to no more than ten (10) pages in length. Verbal requests will not be entertained regarding any information in this announcement.<br>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM 1.0	Description 1.1 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) Exchange (herein called the Exchange) is seeking information about potential methods for providing food services within a single food service concession agreement at GRC. 1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Exchange to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.	Further, the Exchange is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Exchange will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  The responses to this RFI may be used to assist the Exchange in developing a statement of work and evaluation criteria in support of a future procurement. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 2.0	Background The Exchange is a non-appropriated federal instrumentality (NAFI) operating for the benefit of NASA and supporting contractor employees. The Exchange administers and manages operations and activities that create revenue which helps finance activities created to contribute to the efficiency, welfare, and morale of approximately 3300 GRC personnel. The majority of the GRC workforce is on the day shift and has flexible scheduling available. 	The Food Service Program (FSP) is an essential service among the GRC Exchange responsibilities and activities and a contributing force in the continuing well-being and effectiveness of the GRC workforce.   Food service contributes to the social environment of the Center and plays a role in the recruitment, retention and overall satisfaction of its workforce. In addition to the food services under the Exchange Operations, vending routes at various sites on Center are operated by a separate vendor under a separate contract and these vending routes will remain in operation.  There is currently one generally centrally located full service cafeteria facility located at GRC with an average daily customer count of 150.  This facility is operated by a small business Contractor who also can provide catering on an as-needed basis for special events including, but not limited to, celebrations, professional luncheons, holiday activities, meetings, and training events. The existing food service contract can run through May 31, 2015.  The purpose of this RFI is to assist the Exchange in designing and maintaining a follow-on food service program that meets the needs and enhances the quality of life for the GRC workforce. It is expected that the FSP meet the following objectives. (This list is not in order of importance) 	To increase the average daily customer count to at least 12% of the overall workforce 	To provide maximum satisfaction to customers through an efficient and effective operation 	To provide appetizing, appealing and nutritionally sound food alternatives 	To maintain attractive facilities conducive to social interaction and adhere to excellent sanitation and safety standards 	To promote nutritional awareness, and to enlarge employees eating experiences by offering a variety of foods and styles of cuisine 	To maintain or create a consumer feedback process that is constantly refined so as to maintain its vitality and interest 	To effectively implement vibrant marketing strategies 	To give the utmost care in establishing and maintaining a creative, hospitable and quality-oriented catering program that meets the needs and exceeds the expectations of a variety of Center constituencies 	To offer the latest food concepts, in addition to exceptional service and convenient operating hours which are responsive to the needs of the GRC workforce 	To enhance the quality of the food services program and increase sales while maintaining costs at a reasonable level 	To employ state-of-the-art technology to support the food service operation The Exchange is open to fulfilling its Food Service Program through any of the following (or combination):  Traditional cafeteria, Food court, Food trucks, Restaurant (branded or unbranded). Sometime in 2014 the Exchange plans to issue a single Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result in the award of a single concession agreement. The concession agreement will have a minimum five-year performance period, but may be awarded for a longer period of performance dependent on the performance of the concessionaire. The resulting concession agreement will be utilized to support the Exchange in providing a vibrant and quality food service at GRC. 3.0 Responses 3.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with an information package. The information package(s) are due no later than 4:00 PM EST on November 20, 2012 and shall be submitted via e-mail only to Michelle.A.Mader@nasa.gov. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.  To aid the Exchange, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Exchange property and will not be returned. 3.2. The information package shall be limited to ten pages (8.5 x 11) and shall include the following as a minimum: 3.2.1. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact. 3.2.2. Recommended strategy. Interested parties are encouraged to be innovative and propose enhancements and alternative approaches for addressing GRCs needs effectively. 3.2.3. Identify the interest and ability to effectively and efficiently perform the above requirements. 4.0 Site Description The NASA Glenn Research Center is located at Lewis Field, a 350-acre site adjacent to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  GRCs physical plant includes more than 150 buildings that contain a unique collection of world-class test facilities.  There is one generally centrally located full-service Cafeteria.  It should be noted that within a ten (10) mile radius of GRC there are two shopping malls with food courts and full services restaurants as well as a multitude of other fast food and full service restaurants away from the malls.  5.0 Questions All questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Michelle Mader at Michelle.A.Mader@nasa.gov.

	 Project Identification:  Evaluation and Application of EPA?s All Ages Lead Model (AALM)
The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue a sole source award to SRC, Inc. on or after November 15, 2012.  
The National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed an All Ages Lead Model (AALM) that quantitatively relates lead (Pb) exposures from environmental media over a lifetime to Pb concentrations in blood, other tissues, and excreta.  EPA is now interested in proceeding to the next step to make improvements to the AALM based on the evaluation findings subsequent to the SAB review, and to ready the model to meet EPA?s Programmatic needs. The AALM is a complex model mathematically and biologically, as well as with respect to the software needed to develop and implement the model suitable for Program Office use. Efficient and productive work on the model requires familiarity not only with the history of the All Ages Lead Model and applicable software, but also with the evolving and complex issues in estimating Pb levels in blood and bone as surrogates to proposed target tissues for the known adverse health effects of Pb.  EP A seeks the professional services of a scientist with such expertise capable of accomplishing the tasks.
Consultation to include: Develop a project plan to evaluate and apply the AALM Participate in preliminary and monthly meetings Make improvements to the AALM Elaborate AALM?s capability to represent a variety of exposure regimens and                receptor behaviors Compare and resolve differences among model simulation results
This sole source action is authorized in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
Sole source is appropriate and necessary for this contract, because the AALM is a complex model both mathematically and biologically. Familiarity with the software is needed to develop and implement the model is critical to efficient and productive advancement of the AALM code and structure to meet Program Office need.  Equally important is sufficient biological expertise to have the model evolve to appropriately address the complex issues in estimating Pb levels in blood and bone as surrogates to proposed target tissues for the known adverse health effects of Pb.  EPA seeks the professional services with such unique expertise.
The market research conducted did not yield any additional vendors that have the combination of biological, model development expertise, as well as the familiarity with the history of the AALM and the next steps needed to further advance the model.  
Firms may submit their interest and capability statement to the undersigned within 5 days of this announcement, questions within 3 days of this announcement.

Hunter (760) 360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
<p>1. Price - The costs will be evaluated upon the Offeror's ability to demonstrate associated costs with the project in order for the Government to determine reasonableness of price. A comparison of the proposed prices, government estimate and/or market values will be used. Cost realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort may be conducted. The Government will evaluate whether costs reflect a clear understanding of the program requirements and are reasonable and consistent with the various elements of the offer/quote. Offerors are put on notice that any offer/quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity of contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the offer/quote. In addition, the offeror must meet the requirement for responsibility as defined in FAR 9.104. <br /><br />2. Technical Capability - The Government will evaluate an Offeror's technical capability to determine an offeror's ability to meet the requirements identified in the plans and specifications. The merit of the offeror's proposed approach to accomplish the work identified in the plans and specifications will be assessed. This includes the reasonableness of the proposed work plan, scheduling and necessary certifications for achieving the project objectives. For an offer to be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of all requirements and demonstrate that, as a contractor, they have the technical capabilities identified above. The Technical Capability focuses on strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies in the Offeror's proposal. Offerors are advised that any strengths accepted by the Government may be incorporated into the contract as the minimum performance requirement. For the purposes of the proposal, a deficiency is defined as a "failure of a offeror to meet the Government requirement". The technical capabilities will be evaluated against the Offeror's ability to provide for sufficient staff and personnel with sufficient expertise to accomplish the contract requirements. The technical capabilities will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's ability to plan, control and integrate personnel necessary for successful contract performance.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance - The offer/quote will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's relevancy and quality of past experience in performing the work described in the plans and specifications.</p>
<p>Where the relevant present and past performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken, not just planned or promised action. If the Offeror clearly demonstrates that management actions employed in overcoming problems resulted in improvements achieved or problems rectified, this may allow the Offeror to be rated higher than might otherwise be indicated.</p>
<p>All offerors will be given an opportunity to respond to any adverse past performance information obtained by the evaluation team for which the Offeror did not previously have an opportunity to address. Adverse past performance information is defined as information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element in past performance or contained in Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information System (PPIRS) or any less than satisfactory comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />Offerors without a record of relevant present and past performance, or for whom information on present and past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on present and past performance but will receive an "unknown" rating for the past performance factor.</p>
</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined are equal to price.<br /><br />Telephone, written facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will not be honored.&nbsp; Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any subsequent amendments.&nbsp; Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to receive award.&nbsp; You may request an application via phone at 866-606-8220 or register online at https://sam.gov.<br /><br />The technical and cost proposal is due no later than Monday, December 3, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. Central Time.</p>
<span>
<p>A formal site showing/pre-proposal has been scheduled as follows:<br /><br />DATE:&nbsp; Wednesday, November 14, 2012<br />TIME:&nbsp; 10:00 a.m.<br />LOCATION:&nbsp; Cottonwell Road Boat Launch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cameron Parish, Louisiana<br />GPS Coordinates:&nbsp; Lat:&nbsp; N29 51' 38.2"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long:&nbsp; W93, 08' 15.6"<br /><br />All Offerors are required to supply their own boat transportation from the Cottonwell Road Boat Launch to the project site.&nbsp; Boats used for the site showing shall be no longer than 18' and shall be equipped with a surface drive motor (Pro-Drive, Gator-Tail or equivalent type motor).&nbsp; NO AIRBOATS WILL BE ALLOWED.&nbsp; Under no circumstances will the Offerors be allowed to ride in Government owned equipment.<br /><br />All Offerors are required to contact the Contracting Officer to confirm attendance at this site showing/pre-proposal conference at (318) 473-7645.</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be the lowest price technically acceptable offer.
 All technical factors must be met to be considered acceptable. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(1) Technical Capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of either product literature or technical approach narrative and (2) Price.  

Factor 1: Technical Capability
Factor 2: Price 

FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

The Offeror shall describe, in detail, how it will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW).  General statements, that the Offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the solicitationâ€™s specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the Technical proposal.
 The Offeror shall respond with a response attesting to full compliance to the requirements section as outlined in the SOW and address the ability to meet the desired delivery requirement. NO PRICING IS TO BE PROVIDED IN THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION. The Government will determine the Offerorâ€™s Technical score on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. In order for the technical proposal to be considered acceptable it must meet all the technical criteria.

FACTOR 2: PRICE

Offeror shall provide pricing to include any registration or annual fees. Failure to address any of the instructions within this combined synopsis/solicitation may result in a proposal being considered unacceptable.  

Intent is to award based on initial offers.
 If considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted only with those offerors determined to have a reasonable chance for award after the establishment of a competitive range. Parties responding to this solicitation may submit their quote in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g. on company letterhead, formal quotes form, etc.) but must include the following information: 

1.) Company's complete mailing and remittance addresses, discounts for prompt payment, if any (e.g. 1% 10 days), ability to meet delivery requirement and unit cost of product. 

2.) The company's CAGE code, Dun & Bradstreet Number, and Taxpayer ID number. 

3.) In addition, for a quote on a comparable commercial item, product literature must be included.
 

4.) To reiterate, all FAR certifications and representations must also accompany the quote unless available on line. 

METHODOLOGY

At the conclusion of evaluations, the Government will reach a consensus rank for an Offerorâ€™s Technical information and Price. Offerors are advised that the Government seeks quotes that demonstrate acceptable technical compliance at the lowest price. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposed quote represents the lowest price offer with acceptable technical proposals. 

(a) Option periods or quantities: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.
 Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

Any and all questions must be submitted 5 days before close of solicitation.  No questions will be accepted after that time.  Responses must be received no later than 3:30 p.m.

<DESC>Rural Development in Iowa has a continuing need for single family housing appraisals, and intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to small business individuals/firms capable of providing these services. <br /><br />A BPA is not a contract and creates no contractual obligation on either the Government or you as a Contractor. Therefore, the Government is not obligated to place any orders, nor is the contractor obligated to accept any orders. Appraisal services will be requested by issuing a BPA call order via an Order Ticket for each work assignment required.<br /><br />Please refer to the attachments for standards and requirements for a detailed explanation of the BPA terms and conditions, and then complete Items 17a &amp; b, and 30a - c, as applicable on Standard Form 1449, and also the information required on pages 2, 5, &amp; 6 of the BPA, if you would like to be considered under the BPA for Fiscal year 2013. This information, along with the qualification and licensing information indicated in Item 8 on Page 1 and&nbsp; also Item 15 on Page 11 of the BPA will need to be returned to me by 2:00 PM CST on Monday, December 3, 2012. <br /><br /><strong>Please note</strong>: All vendors must maintain an active registration in the System for Acquisition Management (SAM), which was previously known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and On-line Representation and Certification Application (ORCA), in order to be eligible for an award. If you had an active record in CCR, you automatically have an active record in SAM. You do not need to do anything UNLESS a change in your business circumstances requires updates to your Entity record(s). In this case, you will need to make the applicable changes in SAM. You should receive notifications from SAM via email 60, 30, and 15 days prior to your registration expiration. Please check out www.SAM.gov for additional SAM requirements and information.<br />

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United Stated Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372-3695.</p>

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:

1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by
an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors
subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67
cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the
cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)
Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard
Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to
which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be
submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted
class(es) of employees performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required
tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR
This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.

1.  GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONTRACT:
    a. I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.
    b. I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking, tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.
    c. I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and
Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel. 
    d. I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.
    e. I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. Â§1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. Â§2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).
    f. I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.
    g. I understand I must comply with VA's security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
    h. I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2.  GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
    a. Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
    b. The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
        (1) Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
        (2) Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
        (3) I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract.  If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
        (4) Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
        (5) Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
        (6) Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
        (7) Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
        (8) Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
        (9) Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
        (10) Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
        (11) Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COR's orders.
        (12) Ensure that the COR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
        (13) Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COR.
        (14) Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COR.

         (15) Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
        (16) Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COR.
        (17) Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
        (18) Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3.  ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
    a. When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.
    b. Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
    c. I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COR.
    d. I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.

I will respond to all questions within a timely manner prior to the closing of this requirement. In the event I am unable to respond to the questions the closing will be extended.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>QUESTION - I see a blade description of 2x10x120. I assume that this describes a part 2" thick, 10" wide and should the 120 be 240 to indicate a part 20' long? Also is there a hole pattern drawing or is this just a buyout from the manufacturer with holes in it?</p>
<p>ANSWER - The pieces that we quoted were 10 foot sections (20 foot would be impossible to store/install) in the picture it shows the bolt pattern.</p>
<p>First hole is at 3"<br />Second hole 6"<br />Following holes will be on 12' Centers after that until the end of the section which will mimic the first 2.</p>
<p>There are 3 sets of mounting hole vertically in the poly blade you see the top hole in the picture with 2 additional holes below spaced at 1"intervals.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

<DESC><p>The Infrared Space Systems Directorate (IS) Program Office intends to release an amendment to the Request for Proposal number FA8810-12-C-0002, P00001 for the Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) GEO 5-6 Production. It is the Government's intent to contract with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) for this effort under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p>The contract type will primarily be Fixed-Priced Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF). The intended contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1212. The IS Program Office has contracted with LMSSC over the last 16 years. LMSSC is the original and the only responsible prime source that can deliver the required services. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays; therefore, there are no viable options to obtaining competition for this procurement.</p>
<p>The SBIRS constellation consists of geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites and highly elliptical orbit (HEO) payloads. Its mission is to warn against global and theater ballistic missile attacks. Presently, the SBIRS program includes four GEO space vehicles (SV) and four HEO payloads in procurement under the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and SBIRS Follow-on Production (SFP) contracts. In order to support a future SBIRS GEO 5-6 acquisition, this particular contract action will complete the production of two GEO space vehicles following Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Advanced Procurement (AP) for various subsystems and components. There are&nbsp;fifteen (15)&nbsp;priced options on this contract action: GEO 5-6 Contractor Operations Support (KOS); Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) Modification; Dual Band Commanding Upgrade; GPS-M Code Upgrade; Space Vehicle Storage for GEO-5; Space Vehicle Storage for GEO-6; GEO-5 Launch Vehicle Integration (LVI); GEO-6 Launch Vehicle Integration (LVI); GEO-5 Launch and Early On-Orbit Test (LEOT); GEO-6 Launch and Early On-Oribt Test (LEOT);&nbsp;Acoustic Testing for GEO-5; Acoustic Testing for GEO-6; Engineering Studies; Production Studies; and Data Rights. The KOS priced option will provide the Contractor Operators during launch and early on-orbit testing should the government require its support. The SABRS priced option will integrate the design from the Advanced Procurement contract to incorporate the SABRS payload onto the SBIRS GEO 5-6 space vehicles. The Dual Band priced option will integrate the design from the Advanced Procurement contract to incorporate the Dual Band onto the SBIRS GEO 5-6 space vehicles. The GPS-M Code priced option will complete a design of a GPS Receiver with M-Code capability and existing P / Y-code capabilities. The Space Vehicle Storage priced options will provide for ground storage for a three year duration in support of the Ready to Ship dates for both SBIRS GEO 5-6 space vehicles.&nbsp; The Launch Vehicle Integration priced options will provide support to the integration of the Space Vehicle to the Launch Vehicle as well as support to Launch Base Operations.&nbsp; The Launch and Early On-Orbit Test priced options will provide support to post launch operations and analysis as well as supporting test and certification of Space Vehicle for Operations Acceptance.&nbsp; The Acoustic Testing priced options will perform complete acoustic testing on the GEO 5-6 space vehicles. The Engineering studies priced option will perform engineering studies. The Production studies priced option will perform production studies. The Data Rights priced option will provide the rights for data required to define and develop an open system architecture for future satellite competitions as well as&nbsp;rights for data&nbsp;required for sustainment of the SBIRS constellation.</p>
<p>The small business size standard (number of employees) for this requirement is 1,000 under NAICS Code 336414. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LMSSC directly.</p>
<p>The information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.
<p>TOPIC:</p>
<p>The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise necessary to rapidly modify a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) suspension to improve ride quality, handling, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity (CG) locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.). The suspension components that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a HMMWV of the Governments choosing. Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.</p>
<p>Suspension enhancements must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment. This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C (-40&deg; to 140&deg; Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51&deg;C to 71&deg;C (-60&deg; to 160&deg; Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810. Both our soldiers and vehicle components must be capable of operating effectively within this environment. <br /><br />TARDEC is requesting information on proven suspension technologies in the area of springs, dampers, swaybars, and jounce stops that require little to no changes to the vehicle to integrate, and that can be purchased now or quickly modified and purchased within 6 months, using existing manufacturing processes, of this request.</p>
<p>Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address the category as well as address the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Proven suspension technologies in the area of springs, dampers, and swaybars</p>
<p>Objectives: - To evaluate and analyze proven suspension technologies that could be used to improve HMMWV ride quality and handling safety throughout the Family of Vehicles (FoV) weight range.</p>
<p>Responders to this market survey should clearly and briefly address:<br /><br />&bull; Proven Suspension Technologies <br />&bull; Describe available solutions.<br />&bull; Provide any test or analysis results/reports quantifying improvement in ride quality, handling, off-road mobility, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.)<br />&bull; Describe any additional work/modifications required to implement if it's not a direct one for one swap/replacement. <br />&bull; Approximate cost for a vehicle kit.</p>
<p><br />UNCLASSIFIED: Dist A. Approved For Public Release</p>
<p>Does your company have currently developed suspension spring, damper or swaybar technology that can be integrated onto existing HMMWV vehicles ranging in weight from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs.?</p>
<p>Does your company have currently a suspension spring, damper or swaybar technology demonstration HMMWV vehicle that you have already integrated your technology into weighing from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs?</p>
<p>Notes: Existing suspension systems do not have the ability to manage the weight range of the HMMWV FoVs robustly, TARDEC would like to investigate simple modifications that can improve the vehicle's robustness to weight change and capabilities. Further, the designs and materials must be suitable to: <br />i. Withstand all shock and vibration tests specified in MIL-STD-810 <br />ii. Operate in the temperature range of -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C (-40&deg; to 140&deg; Fahrenheit)<br />iii. Have a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 without additional testing or development.</p>
<p><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. Each response is requested to include: <br />a) A brief (no more than one page) company description, history, and industry experience.<br />b) An executive summary (no more than one page) of the information submitted in reply to this market survey.<br />c) Point(s)-of-Contact (POC) with associated information.<br />d) A brief narrative of any internal or external programs that may be leveraged to assist in the R&amp;D of the described technology<br />e) A brief outline of the technologies function and supporting calculations regarding the technologies ability to support the weight range of the HMMWV mentioned above.<br />f) A brief plan for the application of a systems engineering approach as outlined by DoD Directive 5000.1.<br />2. Each response is requested to document any prior related government work experience.<br />3. Each response should be no more than 10 pages in total.<br />4. Each response should include a completed version of Attachment A.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES DUE:</p>
<p>Responses to this Market Survey are due by November 28th, 2012. Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to Mr. Geoffrey Bossio via email at geoffrey.r.bossio.civ@mail.mil. Please format the subject line of the response email as follows; "[Organization Name] response to Market Survey - High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) Suspension Enhancement Investigation"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNCLASSIFIED: Dist A. Approved For Public Release</p>
<p><br />RESPONSE FORMAT(S):</p>
<p>Only electronic responses are requested. Please provide responses in any of the following formats: Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point. Please do not send Zip Files or hard copies via mail. The maximum size of each e-mail should be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name]. All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected<br />3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data, <br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS". <br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br />6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: The NAICS Code issued previously was 424480 and has been changed to 311991, Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturing. Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The solicitation no. has been changed from SPM302-12-R-0011 to SPM302-13-R-0003.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice only and not a solicitation, therefore, proposals are not being solicited or accepted at this time.</p>
<p>The DLA Troop Support Pacific intends to solicit for a full-line of USDA No.1 or better Fresh Fruit and Vegetable (FF&amp;V) products to support Non-DoD USDA School customer requirements in Hawaii. This will be a 100% Small Business Set Aside acquisition. The resultant award will be for an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. It will contain one 12 month base period plus four 12 month option periods. The total length of the contract will be five years. The length of the contract including options if exercised may total 60 months. The options periods, if exercised are at the unilateral rights of the government.</p>
<p>This solicitation will consist of four zones in the Hawaii region. Zone A will consist of Honolulu County Non-DoD USDA School customers. Zone B will consist of Hawaii County Non-DoD USDA School customers. Zone C will consist of Maui County Non-DoD USDA School customers. Zone D will consist of Kauai County Non-DoD USDA School customers. Zones will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria specified. The Government intends to make one (1) award per zone, but reserves the right to award to any combination of offerors. The Government may award more than one (1) zone to one (1) vendor or award all zones to one (1) vendor if one (1) offeror submits the lowest priced technically acceptable offer for all zones. To be considered for award of a zone, offerors DO NOT need to submit offers for ALL zones.

<DESC><p>*THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED AND REPLACED BY PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE #HQ0276-13-R-0002<br /><br />**THIS UPDATED NOTICE SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUSLY ISSUED NOTICES FOR SOLICITATION #HQ0276-12-R-0001.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 for Full and Open Competition for the Development and Initial Production of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIB, or SM-3 Block IIB Interceptors. For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the product development final solicitation will be released in the 4th quarter of FY13, with a contract award in the 4th quarter of FY14. At this time, there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Agency plans to award to U.S. owned companies only.</p>
<p>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System; integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States (U.S.), friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 Block IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2021 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U.S. Homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. Homeland. The SM-3 Block IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 Block IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 Block IIB will be launched using Engage on Remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network. The SM-3 Block IIB is required to be both land and sea compatible, and is targeted for incorporation into Phase 4 of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach.</p>
<p>The successful offeror(s) will need to demonstrate prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense interceptors, experience in land and/or sea-based interceptor system integration, and demonstrated interceptor production and sustainment capability. The Government is considering awarding two (2) contracts through a Preliminary Design Review, at which time one (1) contractor will be selected for further development.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria has been developed to guide prospective offeror(s) as to the priorities applied to the evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.</p>
<p>1. ICBM Defense Performance*<br />1.1. Defended Area of U.S. Homeland<br />1.2. Launch Area Denied<br />1.3. Level of protection<br />1.4. Maximize Government defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture 1.5. Maximize reliability<br />* See paragraph CLASSIFIED ATTACHMENTS below, which describe how to request additional information.</p>
<p>2. Minimized Life Cycle Cost<br />2.1. Minimize modifications to Aegis Weapon System 2.2. Simplicity of design for operations and sustainment 2.3. Minimize unit cost 2.4. Minimize fleet management cost of ICBM interceptors 3. Schedule Realism As in all source selections, the Government will evaluate Technical, Management, Past Performance, and Cost proposals.</p>
<p>FUTURE UPDATES:<br />This pre-solicitation notification, as well as any subsequent procurement notifications, will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/. All interested offeror(s) are encouraged to register at this website to receive email notifications when information related to this acquisition is updated, or documents related to this acquisition are issued and available for download. The Government requests that all interested parties ensure they are listed on the "Interested Vendors List" in FBO. As a rule, the MDA will not send notifications directly to interested offeror(s), and it is in the interested offeror(s)' best interest to periodically check this website for updates.</p>
<p>Please submit all unclassified questions to Joy.Smith@mda.mil and Jennifer.Brooks@mda.mil.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) has released two prospectuses for services at the Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas located within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The two prospectuses are for two different levels of service as well as two different term lengths for the same area and are described below.
-	Full service marina operation identified as "Full Service Draft Contract" includes houseboat and other boat rentals, moorage, retail/grocery, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Full Service Draft Contract is for a term of fifteen (15) years. -	Limited service marina operation identified as "Limited Service Draft Contract" includes moorage, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Limited Service Draft Contract is for a term of ten (10) years.
The Service is interested in maintaining an appropriate level of service on the south end of Lake Roosevelt and therefore have created the two prospectuses to help facilitate interest in bidding. However, if the Service receives a responsive offer, as that term is defined in 36 C.F.R. Part 51, for the Full Service Draft Contract, regardless of whether the Service receives a responsive offer for the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will cancel the Prospectus for the Limited Service Draft Contract before award and select a Concessioner for the Full Service Draft Contract. If the Service only receives a responsive bid to the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will select a concessioner for that Contract. In either case the final contract will be awarded under Concession Contract No. CC-LARO001-13.
Both Prospectuses can be found electronically at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospetuses.htm or by contacting Kimberley Gagliolo, Commercial Services Specialist, at 415-623-2227 or via email at kim_gagliolo@nps.gov.
Proposals must be received by the Pacific West Region, Commercial Services Manager, 333 Bush Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA, 94104, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on January 15, 2013. If you choose to retrieve a copy of the prospectuses from the Service website please notify Kimberley Gagliolo via email so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence. Questions about the prospectuses must be submitted in writing to Kimberley Gagliolo at the email address noted above no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on November 20, 2012.

<DESC><p>Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR)</p>
<p>Amendment 02 - Additional Information:</p>
<p>The SEC intends to extend the current EDGAR contract, SECHQ1-06-C-0045, for six up to (6) months as appropriate and authorized within the current agreement, due to a change in the overall acquisition strategy - EDGAR operations and maintenance and modernization will be handled as separate acquisition events.</p>
<p>Amendment 01 - Additional Information:</p>
<p>In an effort to promote communication between the SEC and industry, the SEC is accepting industry comments, inputs, and recommendations for this EDGAR presolicitation notice. The SEC encourages interested vendors to provide feedback no later than May 31, 2012 to John Bova at bovaj@sec.gov . Please note that it is the intention of the SEC to release the final RFP and announce an Industry Day in early June. The RFP will also include an opportunity for vendors to ask questions.</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DOCUMENT. THE RFP/SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME. THIS NOTICE IS TO MAKE POTENTIAL OFFERORS AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD PLAN FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to award a single contract for the EDGAR system. The base period will be for three (3) years and there will be five (5) option periods of one (1) year each.</p>
<p>EDGAR is a system developed to automate the filing, processing and dissemination of some 125 million pages of registration statements, reports and other filings received by the SEC each year. These submissions currently are received from over 28,000 registered entities and hundreds of thousands of individual filers.</p>
<p>EDGAR was designed as a stand-alone system to include all hardware, applications, and systems software. Contractor support services are currently being used for development of new functionality, systems operation and monitoring, and for hardware and software maintenance.</p>
<p>The major processes of the electronic filing life cycle supported by EDGAR are the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Preparation and submission by filers;<br />&bull; Receipt and acceptance by SEC;<br />&bull; Data storage and retrieval;<br />&bull; Data dissemination to the public; and<br />&bull; Analysis and review by SEC staff.</p>
<p>This acquisition shall include modernization of the entire EDGAR system to include business process transformations for simplifying the current interfaces and functionality, providing support tools for SEC staff, and continuing to utilize web-based, user friendly technology to make filing easier, dissemination faster and cheaper, and further secure the entire process. Additional pertinent information:</p>
<p>&bull; This solicitation shall be awarded for a three (3) year period of performance with five (5) option periods of one (1) year (for a total of eight (8) years);<br />&bull; Dissemination subscription fees for all three (3) contract years and all option years will be specified at the time of contract award and be subject to future modifications;<br />&bull; Revenues derived from sale of dissemination services shall be used to pay for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the Dissemination Subsystem; and<br />&bull; During the first 120 days of this contract, the SEC will curtail development efforts of new functionality to allow proper transition, however, it is expected that any development activity in the pipeline will also be transitioned during this period so that development may resume during the transition period. This does not apply to priority one bug fixes during the transition period.</p>
<p>Draft RFP Sections C &amp; F and attachments F1, F3, &amp; F7 are attached for review.</p>

<DESC>Amendment to the Pre-solicitation Notice for the SOFAST-E Effort<br /><br />NOTICE OF CHANGE TO THE SOFAST-E NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /><br />In accordance with recent changes implemented to the NAICS, code 333319 no longer exists. Accordingly the Government will be utilizing the NAICS 333318. This adjusted NAICS has the same connotation (Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing) as 333319, however, the size standard for business participation will increase from 500 to 1000 employees. <br /><br />This may affect some businesses who, under the auspices of 333319, were ineligible for bidding as the Prime but may now qualify under this new increased size standard. This change should not impact those companies currently planning to bid as the Prime contractor. <br /><br />The Government will be releasing a revised draft Request for Proposal (RFP) the week of October 8-12, 2012, with a target release of the final RFP sometime in late October. <br /><br />**End of Amendment Dated 5 October 2012**<br /><br />Due to internal tracking procedures at PEO STRI, the SOFAST-E solicitation number, W900KK-12-R-0021, has been revised to the subject number W900KK-13-R-0002. The Government will be posting the most current, revised copy of the draft RFP and Attachments under this new solicitation number. <br /><br />Special Note Regarding Tentative Date Changes in the SOFAST-E calendar:<br /><br />* Deadline for Distribution Agreement/Request for Document Library access: 12 October 2012, no later than (NLT) 2:00 PM, EST<br />* Estimated Date for Final RFP Release: 19 October 2012<br />* Cut-off for questions after RFP release: 2 November 2012, NLT 12:00 PM, EST<br />* Proposals Due: 14 December 2012, NLT 2:00 PM, EST<br /><br />Special Note Regarding Access to the Document Library:<br /><br />The GFI list provided in the draft RFP (Attachment 9) comprises ALL the material currently available to the AWARDEE upon contract inception. The vast amount of data and the mixed media upon which it is archived makes it impossible to include it all in the Library. The Government will be including the data it is able to provide and that it feels are necessary to propose against the RFP.<br /><br />If there are any questions/concerns regarding this announcement please email the PEO STRI point of contact, Mr. Matt Sanders, matthew.sanders6@us.army.mil

<DESC>The estimated date for solicitation release has been updated from October 2012 to November 2012.  The estimated award date is July 2013.

The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) and PMW 770, the Undersea Integration Program Office, intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for continued development, maintenance, and sustainment of the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) Control and Management (C&M) software for submarine and other platforms.
The CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.
The technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.
Software code and specification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  The Government anticipates providing updated software code and documents periodically through the procurement process.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site entitled, "Bidder's Repository NDA" and provide the e- mail address and phone number for up to two users to Patricia Ponce-Feliu patricia.poncefeliu@navy.mil.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA-issued PKI certificate, contact Mike Philbrook for further instruction.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.
The Government anticipates issuing a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330- Engineering Services.
The estimated date for solicitation release is October 2012.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 08 - 546 - Miami, FL is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

<DESC>This requirement acquires technical and professional support services, systems management, computer operations, systems programming, cyber security, Access Control Administration, and Surveillance System Support for all DMEA information technology, networking, communications, safety, surveillance, and critical infrastructure software, systems, and applications. Services apply to classified, unclassified and standalone systems and networks.
<p>Work to be performed includes technical, administrative, and professional services in support of DMEA requirements, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Semiconductor foundry process automation system integration, development, and support.<br />&bull; Business Process Management and knowledge management in support of Semiconductor Foundry Processes. <br />&bull; Perform network and PC hardware/software installation and maintenance in the areas that use and store hazardous chemicals and gases.<br />&bull; Computer/Network Systems Support, Computer Network Defense, Exchange Server Administration, Trouble Reporting, Information Center Support, Technical and Computer Equipment Maintenance Support, World Wide Web (WWW), Internet, and Intranet Development and Support for both unclassified and classified networks up to the TOP SECRET level.<br />&bull; Telecommunication System Operation, Integration and Support, Communications Network Support, and Video Teleconferencing Support.<br />&bull; Information Assurance, DoD Certification and Accreditation of systems and networks.<br />&bull; Custom application development and support.<br />&bull; Facility and Infrastructure Protection, Access Control and Surveillance System Support and Administration.<br />&bull; Custom application and system development, and other Production System Support.</p>
<p>Support under this effort provides for DMEA classified and unclassified networks and systems and complies with DoD and DMEA policies and procedures. The contractor provides all services, personnel, materials, and related equipment.</p>
<p>This is a time and materials contract. The base period was awarded at $1,986,360.00, not including the two one-year options. This was a 100% Small Business set-aside.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to staff effort on a 24/7 basis and will be expected to perform in the event of unpredictable emergencies system failures. As a result of changing DoD directives and requirements, the contractor's work effort can not be fully defined at contract award. The contractor is required to work around DMEA workloads which include the semiconductor manufacturing facility and requires the contractor to have a flexible schedule for hardware and software installation, maintenance, and updates. DMEA is growing and anticipates in-house workload fluctuations and growth. In accordance with FAR 16.601(c) (1) a time and materials contract is suitable for this effort. The determination is based on the following rationale: (a) The contract is for information technology, information assurance, and infrastructure protection support services where the level of effort required is not fully known at this time. This will be a competitively awarded contract, thus fair and reasonable pricing will be established by the competitive process; (b) Contract will include a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at their own risk; (c) Appropriate Government surveillance will be performed during performance and will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used; nearly all contract performance is on-site at the Government's facility; (d) The contractor's accounting system is adequate for accumulating costs applicable to the order; and (e) Our local COTR and PCO will be responsible for surveillance during the performance period. Our oversight will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used.</p>
<p><br />PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Base Year: 1 Nov 2012 - 31 Oct 2013<br />Opt Year 1: 1 Nov 2013 - 31 Oct 2014<br />Opt Year 2: 1 Nov 2014 - 31 Oct 2015</p>
<p><br />A Site Visit was held at 10:00am on 8 August, 2012. All interested offerors were invited to attend.</p>
<p>The following FAR clauses apply: 52.212-1, 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial; 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. DFARS clause 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisition of Commercial Items. DPAS Rating is S10.
