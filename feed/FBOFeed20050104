These resultant instruments, methods, QAP, etc., will be used by the U.S. EPA as it's major basis of validating measurements of ambient levels of pollutants that are of concern to the U.S. EPA.  The U.S. EPA relies on the validated instrumentation methodology and QAP as it is the main source of support in determining the validity of it's ambient pollutant determinations.  The U.S. EPA's ambient pollutant data is an essential part of the basis for the U.S. EPA's regulatory ambient air standards for enforcement of the standards.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Ion Poiana, General Manager, National Meteorological Administration, 97 Sos. Bucharest- Ploiesti, Sector 1, 013686 Bucharest, Romania; Phone: +40-21-231-2139; Fax: +40-21-230-3143.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the Integrated Climatology, Agro-Meteorological, Air Pollution Forecast and Warning, Computation and Training Center (INTEROPERATE) project for the Romanian National Meteorological Administration  (RNMA).

Since 2000, the RNMA has focused on implementing a new strategy to create a modern meteorological surveillance system.  The first RNMA investment project, SIMIN, which is valued at $55 million, addressed Romania’s primary objective of modernizing and integrating the country’s various resources and real-time detection capabilities, and also facilitated the exchange of data at the local, regional, and global levels. Under the project, the team led by the RNMA and Lockheed Martin deployed weather radars, automated weather observation stations, lightning detection networks, weather satellite reception, numerical weather prediction models, hydrological buoys, forecaster decision/display systems, and telecommunications networks in Romania. The project team successfully integrated state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and products building on Romania’s existing meteorological infrastructure.  

The DESWAT program was initiated following SIMIN in order to improve the flood forecasting capabilities of the RNMA. The implementation of DESWAT, at a cost of $64 million, represented a significant upgrading of Romania’s hydrological monitoring system, enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response. The lead contractor on this project was Lockheed Martin.

Building upon the SIMIN and DESWAT projects, the Romanian Government is now deploying a water management (WATMAN) system, which will integrate all the information related to river basin monitoring and will include all relevant ‘actors’ – water agencies, industrial, urban, and agricultural users, hydro-works, etc. – into a modern instrument for water management and disaster response. The system will be an essential tool in predicting and managing water emergencies such as floods, droughts, dam accidents, and accidental pollution.

The proposed INTEROPERATE project would upgrade and enhance the existing SIMIN infrastructure, and would also add computing power, data storage capacities, and communications infrastructure in order to collect, integrate, and analyze data generated from the SIMIN, DESWAT, and WATMAN projects, increasing the effectiveness and benefits of all three.  Ultimately, the INTEROPERATE project will form a core element of Romania’s planned National Crisis Management System. The INTEROPERATE project would specifically meet the following objectives:
·	Modernization and enhancement of the observation and processing subsystems for climatology;
·	Modernization of the agro-meteorological monitoring and forecast processes, and integrating them into a national system;
·	Modernization of atmospheric pollution monitoring and forecast processes and integrating them into a national system;
·	Development of a national meteorological data processing and storage center, encompassing data from SIMIN, DESWAT, and WATMAN;
·	Development of an ongoing training program for meteorologists, agro-meteorologists, and environmental experts, with appropriate facilities.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $340,100 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

NIST must be able to compare the numerical results from the new software with the old DMol3 results, without having to recalculate previous results because of numerical differences between methods. DMol3 software from Accelrys is a program to perform quantum mechanical calculations using density functional theory on molecules, surfaces, and solids. They key feature for performance and function are the numerical atom-centered basis sets, which allow the same level of theory to be used for small organic molecules as for solids and surfaces. Other solid state codes that use a planewave basis set require very high-energy cutoffs, large memory, and long computation time that make describing molecular adsorption and hydrogen problematic and inefficient. No other known commercial code has numerical basis sets. DMol3 is also an all electron code, and does not require the use of less accurate pseudopotentials or muffin tins to describe core electrons. NIST also requires that the results be accessible through the Cerius2 and Materials Studio visualizers and interface software, which we already have in-house. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received on or before January 21, 2005, will be considered by the Government. No RFQ package is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Neuro-Oncology Branch proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued services of Dr. Roger Packer, Washington DC, to serve as a pediatric consultant. The Neuro-Oncology Branch, NCI, is a trans-institute program of the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health. The aim of this branch is to develop an integrated clinical, translational and basic research program for the purpose of developing novel experimental therapeutics for children and adults with tumors of the central nervous system. Clinicians in the Neuro-Oncology Clinic conduct clinical trials of novel therapies for patients with brain tumors that can only be found at the NIH. Dr. Packer’s services are still required for the following on going clinical trials which he has been involved on:  1) 02-C-0193 - Phase II Study of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b (Peg-Intron) in Children with Diffuse Pontine Gliomas;  2) 98-C-0074 - : Phase II Trial of Intravenous cereport (RMP-7) and Carboplatin in Childhood Brain Tumors; and 3) 96-C-0068: Pediatric Phase I Trial of RMP-7 and Carboplatin in Brain Tumors.  In addition his expertise is required on the following clinical trials:  1) 97-C-0093 - A Pilot Study of 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging in Pediatric Patients with primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors; and 2) 99-C-0088 - 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Brain in Patients who Receive Neurotoxic Therapy.  Dr. Packer who is credentialed at NIH is world renowned in pediatric neurology and has been responsible for the development of many standard treatment protocols for pediatric patients with CNS tumors.  If Dr. Packer were not to continue to consult on these on-going clinical trials, the trials could be in jeopardy and patients who are actively enrolled in these clinical trials would suffer. Continuity and time constraints are crucial to the clinical trials and Dr. Packer, is the only known source who can meet the Neuro-Oncology Branch’s needs. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on January 19, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Overall size of a High Volume Instrument shall not exceed a width of 4 feet, a tabletop height of 4 feet, and a length of 10 feet in a straight-line configuration.  The instrument shall be configured for operation other than in a straight line.  AMS must approve such configuration prior to delivery.  AMS may operate the instrument in the configuration it deems to its advantage.  The configuration of the overall system shall, in the judgment of AMS, lend itself to ease and practicality of operation in a high volume production environment.  The instrument shall be mounted on lockable casters that shall provide a minimum of 3 inches of clearance from the floor to the lowest point of the instrument.  This shall not interfere with the current instrumentation height as related to the tabletop and the sample eject.  The caster shall be submitted to AMS for approval.  All utility and communication connections must be inside the system’s cabinet.  Systems shall be designed to facilitate ease of disposal of waste sample portions and micronaire plugs.  Instrument shall contain a lid latch that protects the operator from dangerous machine components such as the sampler card cloth.  The lid latch shall latch upon lid closure and will require some type of vendor supplied universal tool for opening the lid latch.  A viewing window of the primary sample preparation and testing area shall be designed into any cabinet cover/hood.  All requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) shall be rigidly complied with by the systems provided under this contract. 

The HVI System (instrument) shall provide measurements of fiber length, fiber mean length, fiber length uniformity index, short fiber index, 1/8-inch gage fiber strength, micronaire reading, fiber color in reflectance and yellowness, and trashmeter percent area of trash and particle count and leaf grade and moisture content.  The moisture measurement shall be a single measurement and not require additional operator intervention.  The length and length uniformity measures shall be made by scanning a suitably prepared tapered beard and measuring, by the fibrogram method, the length equivalent to the staple standards to the nearest one-hundredth of an inch, the mean length to the nearest one-hundredth of an inch, and the fiber length uniformity index equivalent to the ratio of the mean length to upper half mean length expressed as a percentage and reported to the nearest one-tenth unit.  The instrument in maintenance mode shall output the fibrogram used to calculate the upper half mean length, mean length and fiber length uniformity index.  These data will be printed on an AMS supplied printer, connected directly to the instrument and/or displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display.  The fiber strength measurement shall be made on the same tapered beards used for the length measurement, with the jaws of the clamps spaced one-eighth inch apart.  The instrument shall output results in grams per tex to the nearest one-tenth unit.  

Instrument(s) in maintenance mode shall output force-extension (stress-strain) data.  These data will be printed on an AMS supplied printer connected directly to the instrument and/or displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display.

The brushing pressure shall be adjustable.  A device shall be provided with every 5 instruments to measure the brushing force applied to the sample.  This shall be an electronic device that is quickly connected to the instrument and provides a measurement of the force applied by the brush to a fabric material that shall be supplied by AMS.  The brush contact material shall be replaceable upon excessive wear.  A measurement of the normalized peak transducer force in kilograms shall be displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display in the maintenance mode.  Instrument(s) shall output the result to the nearest one-hundredth unit.  

The micronaire reading shall be made by passing a stream of air through a specimen of cotton fibers and reporting the results in standard micronaire units to the nearest one-hundredth unit.  The micronaire chamber shall be adjusted using national fine threads and a dual locking nut system.  This shall provide a finer adjustment and a more secure lock on the micronaire chamber.

Colors shall be measured by illuminating a sample of cotton and measuring the percent reflectance and yellowness of a 10.5-square-inch area of the sample within +/- 1.0 square inches.  The length of the area measured shall not exceed 3.75 inches and the width of the area measured shall not be less than 2.75 inches.  Results will be reported in Hunter’s Rd to the nearest one-tenth unit and in +b to the nearest one-tenth unit.  Instrument(s) shall also output the color code for the Upland or American Pima grade and, for Upland grades, the quadrant of the color code.  The color grade reported by the instrument must conform to the Cotton Program’s HVI Color Grade Lookup Chart, which is based on the Rd and +b readings.  Instruments shall allow color and trash calibration checks while in production mode without changing menu screens.  Incandescent lighting shall not be used as the source of illumination for color and trash measurements.

Percent area of trash shall be measured on a minimum 9-square-inch area of the sample, within +/- 0.1 square inches.  The length of the area measured shall not exceed 3.75 inches and the width of the area measured shall not be less than 2.4 inches.  In order to eliminate fogging of the trashmeter lens filters, the trashmeter cameras shall be assembled without lens filters.  Trash measurements shall be made by a filterless video trashmeter and results will be reported in percent to the nearest one-tenth, except values greater that 5.0 will be reported as 5.0.  Instrument(s) in maintenance mode shall display and/or output the percent area of trash measurement to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent.

The trash particle count will be measured by the “cluster” method and reported to the nearest whole number.  A cluster is defined as a group of trash pixels connected on the same or adjacent scan lines.  A single piece of trash, regardless of its size, will have a cluster count of one.  Instrument(s) shall provide the option of either displaying or outputting this measurement, or both.

Instrument(s) shall have the capability of displaying and/or outputting leaf grade.

Instrument(s) shall monitor color measurement performance and shall have a warning device (buzzer, beeper, etc.,) to alert the operator when the color measurement performance is outside the Government’s stated operating range.  Instrument(s) shall be designed to provide minimal shock to color heads when color measurements are made.

The system shall be under control of its own computer system.  The USDA, AMS, Cotton Program has prepared minimum Information Technology Standards for new HVI purchases by using the applicable sections of the USDA, AMS, Information Technology Standards in Directive 3130.5.  If you feel you have an appropriate justification to not meet these standards, a waiver request must be submitted and approved by the USDA, AMS, Cotton Program.  All waivers requests must include:

CALIBRATION

The instrument system shall be capable of being calibrated to the units shown below:

		Fiber Length:		In inches to three decimal places.

	Length Uniformity:	In percentage points to one decimal place.

	Fiber Strength:	In grams per tex to one decimal place.

	Micronaire:		In micronaire reading units to two decimal places.

	Color Reflectance:	In percentage points to one decimal place. 

	Color Yellowness:	In +b units to one decimal place.

Trash:			In area and count to the numbers shown on the 
				Setup Calibration tiles.
	
The instrument system shall be calibrated to Universal HVI calibration cottons, USDA micronaire calibration orifices, and USDA color and trash tiles within the tolerances listed below for the corresponding quality factor:

Fiber length:  +/- 0.010 inch of the established value for the short and long calibration cotton and +/- 0.016 inch of the difference between the standard values for the short and long calibration cottons (spread or range).

Length uniformity:  +/- 1.0 units of the established value for the short and long calibration cottons and +/- 1.4 units of the difference between the standard values for the short and long calibration cottons (spread or range).

Fiber strength:  +/- 0.7 gram per tex of the established value for the strong and weak calibration cottons and +/- 1.2 grams per tex of the difference between the standard values for the strong and weak calibration cottons (spread or range).

Micronaire:  Instrument must calibrate to within +/- 0.02 on both high and low USDA micronaire calibration orifices.  After calibration, ten replications shall be made on the USDA micronaire chamber size calibration cotton.  The average must be within +/- 0.02 of the established value on the chamber cotton.   

Color reflectance and color yellowness (Rd and +b):  Instrument shall calibrate to within + 0.04 for Rd and within + 0.04 for +b of the USDA values on all five of the USDA tiles.  After calibration is complete, the central tile must read within + 0.04 for Rd and within + 0.04 for +b of the USDA values on this tile.

Trashmeter:   Tile slope and offset constants will be changed by manual entry only.  The only variable manipulated during trash calibration will be the threshold.  The calibration process will automatically iterate through threshold settings until the area measurement being made on the tile is as close as possible to the established area value.  At the end of the threshold calibration, the count measurement and the area measurement will be automatically compared to the established values.  The instrument shall calibrate to within + 0.02 percent area and within + 1 particle count of the USDA values on the USDA calibration tile.  Calibration results that are not within these tolerances will be highlighted on the calibration screen.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) Analytical Services Branch (ASB) seeks to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).    No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.    Please identify whether or not you are a small business or large business in accordance with the NAICS Code.  Qualification Statements are being requested and the associated NAICS code is 541380.  The Statement of Work (SOW) and type of analyses that  are required are posted on the following Website: http:www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm under Announcement Heading. The SOW requires the analysis of Chlorinated Dibenzo-Dioxins and Clorinated Furans (CDDs/CFs) and Chlorinated/PolyChlorinated Biphenyl Congeners (CBs) by Gas Chromatography/High  Resolution Mass Spectrometry (GC/HRMS).  The SOW is supplemented by Exhibits A through H:   Exhibit A details general information; B details specific data delivery requirements and formats; C-CDD lists required reporting levels for the dioxins and furans; C-CB lists required reporting levels for  the Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners; D-CDD details the analytical ethodology required to perform the dioxin/furan analysis; D-CB details the analytical methodology required to perform the Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners analysis; E and F detail specific Quality Assurance  requirements; G is a  glossary; and H details electronic delivery requirements. The contractor should have in place specific Standard Operation Procedures and a Quality Assurance Plan containing the requirements listed in SOW supplemental Exhibits E and F within 60 days following any contract award.  A contractor's  facility may be subject to audits performed by the Agency at any time after award of this contract to ensure the requirements of Exhibits E and F have been met, as well as subject to audits by the Agency to ensure adequate performance of the contract is being met. For evaluating a contractor's  ability to perform the requirements, the contractor must submit the following: 1) a list of references for projects where you have provided similar services; 2) a copy of the contractor's current Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for analysis of Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans, and  Chlorinated/Poly-Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners by Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry; 3) QA/QC Plan, as detailed in Section IV of the SOW; and 4) a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.

Note that all SOP's and the  QA/QC Plan required for submission and evaluation by the Agency may be those that the lab currently uses for work other than that exactly specified in this SOW; i.e., the contractor does not have to create an SOP that meets the exact requirements of Exhibits E and F, but the contractor is required  to submit SOP's and the QA/QC Plan that demonstrates the contractor's ability to perform analysis similar to that detailed in the SOW and supplemental exhibits.  The Contractor will have 60 days after award of a contract to edit the current Contractor SOP's to reflect the exact requirements of the  SOW announced in this solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR LRO PROPULSION SUBSYSTEM
<SOLNBR>1-4-05-RFI-LRO
<RESPDATE>011905
<ARCHDATE>01042006
<CONTACT>Julie A. Janus, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-4931, Fax (301) 286-0341, Email jjanus@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov - Charles  Zakrzwski, LRO Project, Phone (301) 286-3392, Fax (301) 286-1718, Email Charles.M.Zakrzwski@nasa.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), LRO, Propulsion Subsystem THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose: The Robotic Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Program may seek to procure a propulsion subsystem for the LRO spacecraft.  This subsystem would include the thrusters for in-space maneuvers as well as the propellant storage and delivery system.  The propulsion subsystem vendor would provide all the engineer, design, integration, and test support required for the development of the propulsion subsystem. The propulsion subsystem would be integrated to the LRO during spacecraft bus integration.  In order to perform systems level trades, information is sought on monopropellant and bi-propellant options with particular interest in cost and schedule estimates for developing these systems and the assumption used for the estimates. Other propulsion options are invited.  While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  Background: The LRO mission consists of observations of the moon from a low lunar circular orbit (50 km +/- 20 km altitude).  This a 13 month mission at the primary observation altitude with and extended mission at higher elliptical altitude.  LRO will be launch on a Delta-II class launch vehicle in November 2008.	The launch vehicle will inject the spacecraft into a trans-lunar orbit.  LRO’s on-board propulsion system will provide delta V for launch vehicle dispersion errors, capture into lunar orbit, lunar observation altitude orbit maintance, and transfer to end of life elliptical orbit mission altitude.  More information about the LRO mission including science objectives, spacecraft architectures, and spacecraft development schedule can be found on line at http://lunar.gsfc.nasa/missions.gov. Considerations: The LRO Propulsion subsystem design and performance requirements are given in the attached LRO Propulsion Specifications and Information Document.  Included are the delta-V requirements, general design requirements, and interface constraints and considerations.  The current LRO formulation designs for monopropellant and bi-propellant options are included.   The anticipated date of release of an RFP to procure the propulsion subsystem from a vendor, if desired by the LRO project, is March 25, 2005.  The required date of delivery of the spacecraft I&T is November 31, 2006. Information: The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting the overall concepts, estimates of cost and development schedules, comments on interface definitions, and development risk evaluations. The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to improve NASA’s knowledge of industry's capabilities; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what the propulsion options exist for LRO; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow NASA to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry to build the propulsion subsystem for LRO. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry within 14 days of the release date of this RFI, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for subsystem development cost and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates including interface and design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities.  Also included in the response should be performance characteristics of potential systems including mass, power, C&DH requirements, total delta-V capability, and attitude control capability. Responses can be submitted via email. The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for RLO Propulsion System,” and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Chuck Zakrzwski at (301) 286-3392 or Charles.M.Zakrzwski@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov. Interested offerors shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to: Chuck Zakrzwski at Charles.M.Zakrzwski@nasa.gov, no later than 5:00 PM EST on January 19, 2005.

The services will support the execution of unanticipated requirements that materialize throughout a fiscal year.  This is a new requirement a nd a prior award does not exist.  The SAIC Code is 541330 with a Size Standard of $4,000,000.  The contractor shall perform detailed, professional (non-personal) technical support services for the four programs described below:  1.  EITM Program - was esta blished in 2001 to provide information technology applications consistent with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) reporting requirements defined by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) (DUSD(I&E)).  The Army (OASA -I&E) is the Executive Agent (EA) for the EITM Program which currently consists of the following six data management systems: - Defense Environmental Network Information Exchange (DENIX); Knowledge Based Corporate Reporting System (KBCRS); Hazardous Substa nce Management System (HSMS); Solid Waste Annual Reporting System (SWAR); Explosive Safety Siting (ESS); Integrated Pest Management Information System (IPMIS).  The EITM data management systems are used throughout the DOD community.  Users, such as OSD, of ten identify desired system improvements and/or modifications that cannot be anticipated.  These improvements and/or modifications become actual requirements when funded by the users and approved by the Configuration Control Board (CCB).  2.  EQT Program -  prioritizes Army environmental projects, obtains funding and oversees the execution of individual projects.  The Office of the SAIE-ESOH-T is also responsible for managing a number of international environmental technology transfer programs.    3.  CHEM-B IO Program - covers projects in various technology areas related to Chemical and Biological Demilitarization, Disposal, and Remediation.  An example is the current RDT&E effort related to the Transportable Detonation Chamber Technology.  4. Safety Program -  Army safety responsibilities and program requirements are defined in AR 385-10 and other Army Regulations and DA Pamphlets in the 385 series.  DoD safety responsibilities and program requirements are defined in DoDI 6055.1 and other DoDIs in the 6055 se ries.

In addition,  there are specific high-risk safety program areas where recent experience shows greater oversight, program evaluation, and safety program management innovation and information technology solutions are needed, including deployment, explosives, and chemical  activities.  Individual responses to this request for information that may contain company proprietary information must be marked accordingly.  Such informatio n will not be released outside the Government.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE SPACE-CHARGE-CONTROLLED MAGNETIC AUTOSTREAKING

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's space-charge-controlled magnetic autostreaking.

Scientists at LLNL have invented a simple, flexible method for producing enhanced time resolution in a pulsed transmission electron diffraction, imaging, or spectroscopic system. Potential uses of the invention include time-resolved studies of chemical and material transformations with resolutions into the femtosecond regime (depending on implementation and desired capabilities).  The invention is currently a design concept, with one of the goals of an ongoing research effort being the development of one or more prototypes.  When commercial suppliers are ready to develop ultrafast electron diffraction and dynamic TEM systems, the invention could be incorporated into such systems as a basic part of the design.  It should add significant instrument capabilities with little additional manufacturing cost.

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or non-exclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's space-charge-controlled magnetic autostreaking technology should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- Quint Networking Technology Industry Day
<DESC>QUINT NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY (QNT) INDUSTRY DAY - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Information Exploitation Office (IXO), and Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Information and Munition Directorates will be Co-hosting an Industry Day, on 18-19 Jan 05 at Eglin AFB, FL. The purpose of the Industry Day is to familiarize industry with the Quint Networking Technology (QNT) initiative and the associated technology needs to fully integrate small UAV’s, weapon control and related dismounted ground control into the future network centric warfare environment. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation is anticipated to be released shortly after Industry Day.  A draft of the BAA solicitation is anticipated to be published by no later than 12 Jan 05.  The formal BAA announcement is anticipated to be released by no later than 26 Jan 05.  Information contained in the final BAA synopsis takes precedence over any information that is presented at Industry Day or within the draft BAA synopsis.  The objective of the QNT program is to design, develop, evaluate and demonstrate robust, affordable data link technologies suitable for use by expendable platforms such as small unmanned air vehicles (UAV’s) and weapons.  These data links will enable precision strike against time critical and mobile targets, support combat identification of targets, and provide bomb impact assessment (BIA).  It is also envisioned that the data links will allow secure weapon handoff from the launch platform to any of several control platforms in the combat area, both air and surface.  The capability explicitly includes the handling of large numbers of weapons simultaneously. The desired QNT weapon data link (WDL) functional capability includes the ability to transmit target coordinates to a weapon in flight, to alter missions of unmanned airborne platforms and weapons, to allow autonomous bomb damage assessment or bomb hit indications and to enable off board sensor and control supporting cooperative engagement.  The total package supports combat applications in the USN’s FORCEnet Concept and the USAF’s Global Strike Concepts.  The overall QNT goal is to provide the operational strike warfighter with a truly smart weapons capability.  QNT communication technology will be suitable for current and emerging weapons and tactical UAVs.  QNT equipped platforms will be able to communicate with other air vehicles and with ground stations with the strong desire for no new radios in those other air vehicles and ground stations. Some of the operational factors being considered for the QNT program are that weapons can be launched at altitudes from 1K to 50K feet and speeds typically from Mach 0.6 to Mach 0.95 but possibly as high as Mach 1.6.  The number of weapons in flight simultaneously may vary from 1 to 100.  Within the local network’s line of sight there can be 200 position reports/target updates sent per second, and up to 100 bomb damage assessment files (with some possibly including images) being sent per second.  A weapon can fly from 3 to 300+ nm from its launch platform.  A weapon link "lifetime" is 30 seconds to 3 hours.  Once released, a weapon data link is to be fully established and operational (passing traffic) in less than 5 sec.  A subset of weapons may have control transferred to another aircraft or to a ground controller.  The weapon controller can use the weapon data link to change aim points, change weapon configuration, modify weapon trajectory, or initiate a change of control.  The weapon provides health and status information periodically to the controller.  The weapon, if it has an imaging seeker, transmits the last complete seeker image of the target available prior to warhead functioning. QNT will extend the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) capabilities to weapons and also provide the software infrastructure to enable weapons to participate in net centric targeting and control networks. A higher level of integration than ever achieved before is desired to enable a reduction in size and cost by an order of magnitude. The simultaneous application of standards, software defined radio concepts, integration, and size reduction enables QNT transition, avoids adding additional stovepipes and provides essential future flexibility. It is desired that QNT will develop and demonstrate a prototype common family of generic expendable data link equipment suitable for insertion into DoD’s existing and emerging weapons and small UAV’s.  The QNT units will provide two modes: a low rate bi-directional mode and a burst imagery mode. Dynamic net resource management technology that exploits evolving Global Grid technology will scale up to support hundreds of vehicles in flight. Cost goals and integration goals ensure that QNT technology can be included in the largest number of expendable platform types. Advanced INFOSEC techniques will be employed to provide secure weapon data links and controller handovers in an operationally efficient manner. QNT Industry day will be held at Eglin AFB, FL on 18-19 Jan 05 in the Eglin Conference Center.  Sign-in will begin at 0800 hours and the government briefing will begin at 0900 hours and conclude at 1200.  The briefing will be UNCLASSIFIED.

<SUBJECT>84 -- FPI Production in FS Group 84 - Brown and Gray T-Shirts
<DESC>This notice announces the decision regarding Federal Prison Industries’ (FPI) production in Federal Supply (FS) Group  84 - Clothing, Individual Equipment, and Insignia.  FPI’s new product/significant expansion guidelines were published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register.  A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product’s expansion threshold in cases of a public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.  
     During the February 2004 Board of Directors (the Board) meeting, FPI presented a request to the Board to invoke the national exigency provision of the guidelines for FPI production of t-shirts.  The Board approved FPI’s request during the February Board meeting.  In July 2004, FPI posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) detailing the additional production due to the national exigency. 
     Since that time, while still under the national exigency provision, FPI has received another request from the DoD for additional gray t-shirts.  The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) has indicated that it wants FPI to significantly reduce or terminate its production of brown t-shirts, for which DSCP has numerous vendors, and focus almost exclusively on the gray t-shirts for which DSCP has limited vendors.  At the December 2004 meeting, the Board approved this request, which would increase FPI’s t-shirt sales from $15.7 million to approximately $19.2 million.  The total units of t-shirts produced by FPI will not increase (from current exigency levels of 3.9 million units).  Under the current exigency, FPI’s units limitations are 2.3 million units of gray t-shirts and 1.6 million units of brown undershirts.  In response to DSCP’s request, FPI will reduce or eliminate its production of brown t-shirts, substituting the gray t-shirts for the brown, per the request, and exceeding sales levels on gray t-shirts to fulfill the customer’s needs. 
     As with the previous request, the “national exigency” provision is temporary, allowing FPI to exceed the normal sales ceilings while the exigency is in effect.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher level as a future production baseline.  FPI and DoD are uncertain as to how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military war efforts and the continuing war on terrorism.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD’s expanded needs will continue through the balance of the current fiscal year (FY) and into FY 2006.      
     Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>84 -- FPI - Revised Guidelines Ceilings Due to Change in Material for the New Battle Dress Uniforms
<DESC>On December 7, 2004, Federal Prison Industries' (FPI) Board of Directors (the Board) revised FPI's authorized sales ceilings for work clothing, specifically, Battle Dress Uniforms (BDUs).  FPI’s primary customer for this item is the Department of Defense (DOD).  Recently, the Army decided to replace the existing Battle Dress Uniforms (BDUs) with a new version that has substantially increased costs primarily due to choice of fabric.  The Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP), has indicated that FPI will be one of the first suppliers converted to the new BDU design.  The increase in material cost of the BDU set, will result in a sales increase of approximately $10 million per year.  The resulting sales increase will cause FPI to exceed its Board authorized ceilings for work clothing (which currently includes BDUs).    
     FPI requested that the Board revise the sales ceilings to reflect the units of production previously approved and the costs for the new fabric.  The current authorized sales ceiling for work clothing in fiscal year (FY) 2005 is $45.9 million.  This level has not increased since 2000, except for a three percent annual increase for inflation, approved by the Board.  With similar inflation adjustments for 2006-2007, the authorized sales ceiling vs the sales levels necessary to accommodate the new material costs would compare as follows: $45.9 million to 
$56 million in FY 2005, $57 million in FY 2006, and $59 million in FY 2007. 
     FPI emphasized in its request to the Board, that the increased cost of fabric is the only reason that the sales will increase over the previous Board-authorized ceilings.  This action will not have an adverse impact on the private sector as the number of units produced by FPI does not proposed to change.  
     FPI's market share for this product should not increase as the size of the federal market will increase accordingly based on the increased sales costs associated with the new fabric.  Precedent exists for this type of Board decision, as a similar situation occurred when DSCP went to a higher cost material for its Physical Fitness Uniform (PFU) trunks and sweatsuits in August and September of 1999.  The change to increase FPI's dollar ceilings commensurate with the new materials was approved by the FPI Board at the time.
     Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>84 -- FPI's Production in FS Group 84 - Army Combat Uniforms
<DESC>This notice announces the decision regarding Federal Prison Industries’(FPI) production in Federal Supply (FS) Group 84 - Clothing, Individual Equipment, and Insignia.  FPI’s new product/significant expansion guidelines were published 
March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register.

Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.  
     Recently, FPI received a request from DoD for additional Army Combat Uniforms (ACUs) for the Army.  ACUs are included within FPI’s "Work Clothing" category.  The request from DoD would necessitate an increase in FPI’s Work Clothing production ceiling.  The Army has requested that FPI produce up to 10,000 additional ACUs per month for eight months, or up to 80,000 ACUs per year.  The additional ACU production will increase the Work Clothing ceiling by approximately $5.0 million for the eight month duration. 
     In light of the military’s critical need, FPI's Board of Directors approved the request to invoke the national exigency provision of the guidelines.  It should be noted that the "national exigency" provision is temporary, allowing FPI to exceed the normal sales ceilings while the exigency is in effect.  In this instance, the Army does not anticipate the additional requirements for more than eight months.  The exigency does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher level as a future production baseline.
     Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: RACS Branch.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information: Universal Serial Bus (USB) equipped Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. In mobile military healthcare, first responders and front line clinicians use the Pocket PC Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) in conjunction with Battlefield Medical Information System Telemedicine (BMIST) to provide fast and efficient data entry for combat  casualty care.  Medics capture data on a Personal Information Carrier (PIC) for maintenance of a longitudinal medical record.  The next generation Electronic Medical Record will include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) physical interface.  The current PDA ava ilable does not support a USB interface.  For future mobile EMRs to be successful, there must be a mobile device that supports this physical interface.  According to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the USB electronic memory device w ill be the joint services standard for physically transmitting clinical encounter information. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC) Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) seeks to understand what technologies are currently available or could be available within a reasonable time period and provide the c ombination of a PDA and an integrated USB interface.  This device should be capable of running Windows Mobile 2003. Please submit information no later then 21 January 2005.  For questions and submission contact: Mr. Mark Jeffrey USAMRMC TATRC (301) 619-7937 Jeffrey@tatrc.org OR Renee Clerici USAMRMC TATRC (301) 619-7922 Clerici@tatrc.org

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number W74V8H-04-R-0015 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is 100% set aside for Small Business Concerns.  The associated NAICS code is 541618 and  small business size standard is $6 million.  The Defense Contracting Command-Washington is soliciting proposals for the following requirement (No Substitutes): STATEMENT OF WORK  - BACKGROUND: The Department of Defense, Office of Assistant Secretary of De fense, Networks and Information Integration (OASD NII) continues to engage comprehensively and proactively in policy-making and regulatory forums both within the United States and internationally.  This engagement has yielded positive results, contributing  to efforts by the Department to safeguard spectrum access and to contribute to the stabilization and development of civil-military spectrum relations required to support all Department activities and operations globally.  In addition, OASD NII has continu ed to work with other agencies in the domestic arena to coordinate policies affecting the use of spectrum within the continental U.S. (CONUS) - both for national security/homeland security and for continued commercial telecommunications sector growth. Cont inued and expanded efforts to shepherd the spectrum resources of the Department of Defense (DoD) are imperative, both internationally and domestically.  At home, DoD will continue to navigate between pressing commercial needs and desires for spectrum, adva ncing and changing technologies, and ongoing military needs for spectrum, across all Services.  Outside CONUS, the successful prosecution of the War on Terror requires proactive support and engagement for the war fighter's access to spectrum resources on m ultiple fronts, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.  OSD NII must continue to play an integral role in aiding our allies in the Middle East and western Asia to develop spectrum-based military capabilities and to coordinate that development with the paral lel development of commercial telecommunications industries.  SCOPE:   The contractor will provide support for continued outreach and coordination of DoD spectrum-management policies, as well as monitoring of the development of regulations and commercial i ssues that may impact the Department's access to, and use of, spectrum.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date for proposals from 4:00pm eastern time on January 7, 2005 to 4:00pm eastern time on January 14, 2005 and to add the following Part 6 to the Statement Of Work:
6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA seeks to hire a Definitional Mission (DM) team to travel to the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP) area to investigate energy sector projects, including generation, power transmission, and regulatory requirements, among others, for potential USTDA funding.  The team will also provide suggestions to USTDA for Orientation Visits (reverse trade missions) and conferences, as appropriate.  The team is required to travel to Botswana, but will be expected to propose which other SAPP countries they believe will be most beneficial for travel to recommend high quality projects.  

The SAPP is facing an impending energy crisis in the coming years, perhaps as early as 2007.  Eskom currently produced more electricity than South Africa needs, thus the company controls most of the traded energy in the region.  As South African demand is expected to exceed supply by 2007, Eskom will soon not be able to fill the electricity gaps in the other SAPP countries.  It is feared that any power Eskom does export will only be available at very high prices.  Energy supply remains a critical issue for development for all of the countries in the SAPP, and therefore continues to be a development priority for each member government.  

Through recent and past USTDA staff travel to the region, the agency has received a leads for assistance with energy projects throughout the region.  Given the interconnected nature of the power pool, a least-cost generation analysis must consider the entire region, and financing opportunities may be enhanced by considering region-wide demand.  It is expected that USTDA's assistance would potentially serve as an impetus for U.S. involvement in energy sector development in this region at this critical time.  

Botswana offers at least two major energy generation projects: the Mmamabule coal-fired power station, and the Eastern Botswana coal-bed methane project.  The Mmamabule coal-fired power station is estimated to have a 3,600 MW capacity by 2015.  The Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) has already discussed power offtake with South Africa's Eskom.  The second project is the Eastern Botswana coal-bed methane project, for which USTDA funded the feasibility study in 2003.  As the feasibility study comes to a close, further USTDA assistance may be merited to help move the project to implementation.  The project has already received preliminary Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) funding.  A potential project could examine the potential of using a gas-fired power plant that would burn coal-bed methane as one solution to the country’s electricity needs. The definitional mission team should also explore other technical assistance for Botswana's energy ministry and related entities.

USTDA expects bidders to propose a strategy that they believe will be the best approach for recommending high quality projects.  For background purposes only, we are providing some information below about a few possibilities in Mozambique and Namibia.  This should in no way be construed as comprehensive or as the areas with the most opportunity for USTDA assistance.


Mozambique is a critical country with regard to the future of the Southern African Power Pool.  Cahora Bassa, a hyrdoelectric dam on Mozambique’s Zambezi River, generates 2040 MW of power.  Mozambican authorities are considering a plan to increase capacity at that site by 600 MW.  At the same time, Mozambique is seeking private investors to develop Mepanda Uncua -- a 1200 MW hydropower plant further downstream.  Additionally, the government seeks assistance from foreign experts to develop gas fired power plant facilities fed by new natural gas streams from a pipeline between Northern Mozambique and South Africa.  Finally, Mozambique is pushing forward with projects to extend the power pool to its neighbors including a transmission interconnect project with Malawi.

Nambia seeks to solve pending power supply shortages through new power generation and improved transmission infrastructure.  The government sees the offshore Kudu gas reserves as an opportunity to develop an on-shore 800 MW gas-fired power plant at Oranjemund.  The financial feasibility of this project is in question, as the cost of landing the gas needs to be determined.  In the short term, Namibia plans to press forward with extending its transmission networks to import power from Zambia and, by extension, from Mozambique, through the development of the Trans-Caprivi Power Transmission project.  Namibia is also a crucial player in the Western Corridor Power Project -- a transmission project to deliver hydropower from the Congo River to Angola, Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.

6. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

São Paulo
The government of the State of São Paulo is planning to concession to the private sector the management of its extensive communications network and data centers that support the state’s e-government programs. The Intragov Communications Network is the communications network for data, voice, and image traffic for the São Paulo State Government. Intragov integrates all state secretariats and agencies, the state legislature, and judiciary.  The state government has 20,000 administrative units in 645 municipalities across the state.  There are over 4,500 communication lines installed at schools, “poupatempos” (one-stop service centers), internal revenue centers, courts of justice, subway stations, police stations, hospitals, etc.  Numerous municipalities have also joined the Intragov Communications Network to connect with the state government and to access the internet.  The state spends over US$68 million annually to operate its communications network.

The state government also intends to integrate and upgrade several shared government data centers in order to meet increased demand.  This will involve increasing the service capacity of the management and help desks; increasing the computing capacity of the mainframe computers that support the state government’s major applications; implementing security systems; adapting buildings and electrical supply to handle additional servers; upgrading information service management systems and defining a contingency plan for critical services; increasing physical security; and adapting the communications network.  For example, some of the servers used for the provision of internet service were acquired in 1997 and need to be replaced.  The back-up system for every platform needs to be updated.  The system currently records 11 million hacker attempts per month and there is a real need to upgrade cyber and physical security.

Ceará
As with the State of São Paulo, the State of Ceará’s needs to upgrade its IT infrastructure to keep pace with continuous growth of its e-government programs.  The State of Ceará is planning to contract a private company to provide data center services to the state government.  The company will be required to invest and build the data center, deliver processing capacity and storage space that meet high quality and security standards, and maintain and update the infrastructure to meet the government’s requirements.  The data center is expected to host the integrated government management system, process control system, official publication system, finance and accounting functions, public budget system, project management system, procurement system, governmental portal, etc.  

The DM consultants would work with both projects sponsors to define the appropriate terms of reference and budget for the feasibility studies.  Both project sponsors have expressed interest in a study that will help define technical specifications, project costs, and the economic and financial analysis required to determine how to best structure the business model of the respective projects.  The projects would be implemented through an international competitive bid.

Both state governments are planning to implement these projects with the participation of the private sector, using the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework.  On December 22, 2004, Brazil’s Congress approved the Public-Private Partnership legislation, which is intended to stimulate private investment in infrastructure backed in part by government guarantees.  The State of São Paulo has already enacted its own PPP law and the state legislature in Ceará approved its state PPP legislation in early December 2004.

Both projects contemplate utilizing the state government resources that are currently spent on the telecommunications and IT systems as a source of revenue for the private contractor.  For example, the State of São Paulo spends approximately US$68 million per year for the Intragov Communications Network and about US$3 million annually for its principal data center. In the State of Ceará, the government has invested approximately US$4.5 million over the past three years to acquire servers and other network equipment, not including software and services.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify questions posed by potential offerors.  The work location for the occupants:  Plant City: 4004 Airport Rd, Plant City, FL 33563.  Quincy: 2049 Pat Thomas Pkwy (Lake Talquin Hwy), Quincy, FL 32351.  Middlebu rg: Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, Starke, FL (The prefered area is Middleburg.  The occupants currently stay in Orange Park). There is no specific required radius for commuting.  Obviously the closer the better, but a trade-off can be made for a bet ter proposal at a further distance.  You have great latitude as an offeror to break down your offer to allow the government to pick and choose options.  For instance, the two-bedroom apartments could potentially have one or two bathrooms.  It is up to you to propose one or the other, or both.   It is up to you to propose offers for furnishings and services packages (i.e. washer/dryer, cable tv, high-speed internet).  Maid service could be weekly, bi-weekly, monthly.  It is up to you to propose the frequency and a description of services provide d.  You do not need to submit a police report for the properties you propose.  You have been informed that the government is concerned about the safety of the occupants and will gather information about properties in order to deem them safe.  You should do  some sort of background check.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for Solicitation W91RUS-05-R-0002. Q1:  What is providing the encryption, STU-III, STE, OMNI or Sectera?  A1:  The encryption question is going in the wrong direction, this system will not nor will it ever transmit classified data, just data requiring privacy protection as stated in HIPAA regulations. The security details are stated at this web link: http://www.j2corporate.com/corp/twa/page/secureFaxSolutions  128 bit SSL encryption is an integral part of domestic web based internet browsers, it is a DOD recognized and authorized encryption system for use in the above listed situations. No additional encryption is required. Once the fax reaches the vendor it is sent as a standard fax over existing phone lines which is again authorized under HIPAA regulations since interception of this information by other than the intended parties is a Federal crime. The standard description of the information is Sensitive but Unclassified.   This system is intended solely for the transmission of patient information for the purposes of obtaining authorizations for clinical treatment not available in the Military treatment facility and for no other purposes. HIPAA compliance by the vendor is the primary consideration and it is the vendors responsibility to maintain their own certification, not the United States Army's. They would be the one subject to civil (vice criminal) penalties should a violation of HIPAA regulations occur. The encryption used by this system is sufficient to safeguard the patients privacy until the data is transmitted to the vendor's secure server, at that point patient privacy becomes the responsibility of the vendor in question. Q2:  When is the bid response due back?  A2:  Proposals are due on 13 January 2005 0800 AM.
