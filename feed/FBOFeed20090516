<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp. All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website as well as the AFCEE ECOS09 website listed above. Note: Only small business firms can register on the ECOS09 website as interested primes.</p>
<p>No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address. Inquiries may be directed to sheri.brassfield@brooks.af.mil and yvonne.camarce@brooks.af.mil. Please ensure emails are sent to both POCs.</p>
