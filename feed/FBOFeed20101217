<a href="mailto:joseph.badalamenti@us.army.mil">TACOM Contracting Center (TACOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>INTRODUCTION: Mounted Soldier System (MSS) links crewmembers to their platforms while mounted or dismounted. It contains three subsystems: (1.) the Mounted Soldier Cordless Communications Subsystem (MSCCS),  (2.) the Mounted Soldier Display Subsystem (MSDS), and (3.) the Mounted Soldier Cooling Subsystem (MSCS).  All three subsystems comprise soldier worn equipment as well as vehicle-mounted equipment.  All vehicle-mounted equipment will interface with and fit footprint of platform A-Kits.  As envisioned, MSS equipment will be used on 16 different Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) and 11 different Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) platform types.  Separate sources sought will be released for each of the Mounted Soldier Subsystems.  Sources sought cross reference numbers are as follows:  W56HZV- MSCCS, W56HZV-MSDS and W56HZV-MSCS.<BR><BR>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought announcement for the Mounted Soldier Display Subsystem (MSDS) of the Mounted Soldier System (MSS). This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  On behalf of the Project Manager Soldier Warrior (PM-SWAR), the US Army Contracting Command, TACOM Contracting Center, is conducting a market research to identify potential sources for the production and delivery of the MSDS requirements. Any future contract action for this requirement is anticipated to be on a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basis for up to five years.  <BR><BR>CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS: The system will be used on 16 different platforms in a Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) and on 11 different platforms in a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).<BR><BR>SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The system consists of soldier-worn components and vehicle- mounted components.  Under the current configuration, the MSDS soldier components consist of: Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) or Micro-display, and a Display Control Module (DCM) or Integrated Control Module (ICM). Likewise, the current configuration of the MSDS vehicle components consist of: Video Switch Box (VSB), video coil cable, straight cable and A-kit mounting brackets and hardware (A-Kit is procured separately.) The current system configuration component descriptions are provided below:<BR><BR> Helmet Mounted Display or Micro-Display. Provides a full color display with a breakaway cable and allows remote viewing of the platform/vehicle-based displays and sensors. The HMD is attached to either the right or left top front of the helmet. The Micro-Display is clipped to either the right or left side of the helmet. The display weight shall be 0.5 lb or less.<BR><BR> Display Control Module (DCM) or Integrated Control Module (ICM). The DCM allows the Mounted Soldier to toggle between video sources, and adjust brightness. The DCM/ICM controls video input from the VSB to the HMD. The ICM combines two controllers (DCM and Smart Adapter from the MS Cordless Communications Subsystem) into one controller.  The ICM controls include channel up/down, volume up/down, push-to-talk (PTT), brightness up/down and video selection. The DCM weight shall be 0.65 lbs or less. The DCM shall be 1.2"X4.3"X3.1". The ICM weight shall be 1.45 lbs or less. The ICM shall be 1.3"X4.9"X3.4". Since the ICM also controls the Mounted Soldier Cordless Communications Subsystem (MSCCS) and the basis of issue for the Mounted Soldier Display Subsystem (MSDS) is in some cases different, there is a potential need for both the DCM and the ICM.<BR><BR> Video Coil Cable. The Video Coil Cable connects from the DCM or ICM to the soldier video port on the vehicle. This cable provides the video from vehicle on-board sources. The cable weight shall be 1 lb. When fully extended, the cable shall be 112" long. The cable shall be 39" inches when not stretched. <BR><BR> Straight Cable (10, 11, 16 or 24 ft). Connects the soldier video port to the Video Switch Box (VSB). The maximum weight for the 24 ft cable shall be 3.0 lbs.<BR><BR> Video Switch Box (VSB). The vehicle-mounted VSB collects the video signals from the host platform and feeds the video to the DCM/ICM which routes it to the HMD. The VSB integrates video signals from the vehicle displays and sensors.  VSB shall support 4 users and 5 video input signals. The VSB shall be 9.5"W X 6.6"D X 2.25"H in order to fit available space in the vehicle. The VSB weight shall be 4.6 lbs or less.<BR><BR>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: <BR>The proposed system shall be a proven technology with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or better.  Sources sought capabilities provided below are a limited subset of the total system requirements.  The system shall contain the following capabilities: <BR><BR> Ability to access video images from the Force XXI Battle Command display, Brigade and Below (FBCB2), Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE), and Remote Weapon System (RWS) and other vehicle sensors.<BR><BR> Helmet-mounted full-color, removable user monocular display that provides readable displays, during day and night operations, without distortion or text degradation. <BR><BR> At a minimum, standard 800X600, 60Hz (non-interlaced) pixel resolution to read messages, icons, images, maps, and graphics.<BR><BR> Ability to position display over either eye, or stowable out of the users field of view without disconnecting from the system. <BR><BR> Must be physically, optically, and functionally compatible with Army crewman carried equipment without degrading their performance to include headgear and helmet. <BR><BR> Cable and connectors shall meet MIL-STD-461F for EMI shielding and grounding standards, MIL-STD-1472F and MIL-DTL-38999.<BR><BR> Head breakaway connectors shall fully separate with a force of 15 (  3) pounds.<BR><BR> Body breakaway connectors shall fully separate with a force of 20 pounds ( 3)<BR><BR> Soldier worn connectors shall endure at least 1000 disconnect/reconnect cycles without failure.<BR><BR> Head-borne weight of Mounted Soldier components shall not exceed 1.4 pounds<BR><BR> Mean-Time-Between-Failure (MTBF) of 3600 Hours demonstrated with 90% Lower Confidence Level<BR><BR> Mean-Time-Between-Essential-Function-Failure (MTBEFF) of at least 1800 operational hours demonstrated with 90% Lower Confidence Level<BR><BR> The system uses 18.2 watts nominal power with a peak power of 28 watts (Minimum Voltage: 18Vdc, Nominal Voltage: 28Vdc, Maximum Voltage: 33Vdc, Nominal Current: 650mA, Maximum Current: 1A<BR><BR> Mean-Time-To-Repair (MTTR) of less than 0.5 hours at Unit Maintenance Level<BR><BR> Maintenance Ratio (MR) of < 0.005 Maintenance Man Hours/System Operating Hours.<BR><BR> Shall not contain Flourocarbon/polymide (Kapton), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and HC Chrome.

All three subsystems comprise soldier worn equipment as well as vehicle-mounted equipment.  All vehicle-mounted equipment will interface with and fit footprint of platform A-Kits.  As envisioned, MSS equipment will be used on 16 different Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) and 11 different Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) platform types.  Separate sources sought will be released for each of the Mounted Soldier Subsystems.  Sources sought cross reference numbers are as follows:  W56HZV-MSCCS, W56HZV-MSDS and W56HZV-MSCS.<BR><BR>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought announcement for the Mounted Soldier Cordless Communications Subsystem (MSCCS) of the Mounted Soldier System (MSS). This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  <BR><BR>On behalf of the Project Manager Soldier Warrior (PM-SWAR), the US Army Contracting Command, TACOM Contracting Center, is conducting market research to identify potential sources for the production and delivery of the MSCCS requirements. Any future contract action for this requirement is anticipated to be on a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basis for up to five years.  <BR><BR>CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS: The system will be used on 16 different platforms in a Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) and on 11 different platforms in a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).<BR><BR>SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The system consists of soldier-worn components and vehicle- mounted components.  Under the current configuration, the MSCCS soldier components consist of: Soldier Radio with antenna and battery, Smart Adapter, or Integrated Control Module (ICM). Likewise, the current configuration of the MSCCS vehicle components consist of: Interface Box (IB) with vehicle radio, Band Pass Filter (BPF) and cable, vehicle antenna with cable, intercom cable, and A-kit mounting brackets and hardware (A-Kit is procured separately.) The current system configuration components description is provided below:<BR><BR> 	Radio with antenna.  The Joint Tactical Radio System Enhanced Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio MBITR (JEM) radio (AN/PRC-148) is the wireless communications component of the Cordless Communication Subsystem. This radio provides secure communications back to the crewmembers vehicle when the crewmember is dismounted from the vehicle and while mounted in the vehicle. The JEM Radio allows untethered communications enabling crewmembers  an uninterrupted access to vehicle intercom and radios while mounted or dismounted. The JEM provides audible warning tones to the mounted soldier alerting him when he has become untethered from the wired intercom (VIC-3).  <BR><BR> 	Radio Battery. The battery provides power for the Soldier worn JEM and the headset when untethered from the VIC-3 vehicle intercom system.<BR><BR> 	Smart adapter or  Integrated Control Module (ICM). A wired interconnection  exists between the JEM Radio, Headset, and the Vehicle Crew Station (FFCS) whenever the Soldier is tethered.  This is accomplished either via the smart adapter or the ICM.  It detects when the soldier becomes disconnected from the intercom. The smart adapter provides a 7-position channel switch, a 6-position volume switch, and momentary push-to-talk (PTT) switch.  When un-tethered and the headset PTT switch is in the momentary ON position, the Smart Adapter or ICM PTT will signal the JEM to transmit. It provides power from the radio battery to the headset while untethered.  In addition to providing the same functions as the smart adapter, the ICM also controls the Display Subsystem (brightness, video display selection).   Since the ICM also controls the Display Subsystem and the basis of issue for the Display Subsystem is in some cases different than the Mounted Soldier Cordless Communications Subsystem (MSCCS), there is a potential need for both the Smart adapter and Integrated Control Module (ICM).<BR><BR> 	Interface Box (IB). The vehicle-mounted Interface Box provides access to the platform's vehicular-intercommunication system (VIC-3) through the Full Function Crew Station (FFCS). The IB integrates and interoperates with the VIC-3 to provide a secure wireless extension of the wired intercom communication capabilities.  The IB provides both the mechanical and electrical support for the vehicle JEM Radio. Since the JEM radio is a Cryptographic Controlled Item (CCI), a locking mechanism is provided to inhibit unauthorized removal of the JEM Radio from the Interface Box. The IB is powered through the VIC-3 connection. The IB must be 8.3"W X 6.6"D X 3.7H in order to fit available space in the vehicle.<BR><BR> 	Vehicle Radio. A JEM radio without battery is placed within the IB to provide the wireless communications.<BR><BR> 	Vehicle Intercom (VIC-3) Cable. This cable provides the connection from the IB to the VIC-3 intercom system.  <BR><BR> 	Band Pass Filter (BPF) Cable. This cable connects the IB to the BPF.<BR><BR> 	Band Pass Filter (BPF). The vehicle-mounted BPF is used to provide the signal path between the radio and the external antenna. The BFP is a device that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects frequencies outside that range.  This allows the Cordless Communication System to operate in the presence of other communications systems already installed in the vehicles and eliminates interference.  <BR><BR> 	Antenna Cable. This cable connects the vehicle antenna to the BPF.<BR><BR> 	Antenna.  The antenna installs on the outside of the vehicle and connects to the IB within the vehicle though the BPF.<BR><BR><BR>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: <BR>The proposed system shall be a proven technology with Technology Readiness Level (TRL)6 or better. Sources sought capabilities provided below are a limited subset of the total system requirements.  The system shall contain the following capabilities: <BR><BR> 	For its intended use, remain secure at the Secret level via the use of DoD-approved Communications Security (COMSEC) encryption devices and keying materials.  <BR><BR> 	The DOD-approved Communications Security (COMSEC) device must retain the key during a timed battery swap for duration of 5 minutes after the battery is removed. <BR><BR> 	Operate in a designated military frequency.<BR><BR> 	Voice communications among all untethered users range equal to at least 300 meters [T], 500 meters [O], from the host vehicle.<BR><BR> 	Enable crewmen to have uninterrupted access to vehicle communication, and preclude inadvertent separation not to exceed 100 milliseconds delay between tethered and untethered operations.<BR><BR> 	Controls: Push to talk, channel selection, volume, zeroize and power on/off.<BR><BR> 	Capability to securely interface to the vehicle's intercom system<BR><BR> 	Operate on 28VDC vehicle power, and rechargeable or non-rechargeable lithium ion<BR><BR> 	Operate on a fully charged battery for at least 8 hours<BR><BR> 	Alert/tones: when the battery life has approximately 12.5% remaining and when the wireless comms system becomes unplugged from the vehicle intercom (VIC).<BR><BR> 	The soldier worn components shall not exceed 3.5 pounds<BR><BR> 	The interface box must be less than or equal to: 8.3"W X 6.6"D X 3.7"H.<BR><BR> 	Must be physically, optically, and functionally compatible with Army crewman carried equipment without degrading their performance to include headgear. <BR><BR> 	Cable and connectors must meet MIL-STD-461F for EMI shielding and grounding standards, MIL-STD-1472F and MIL-DTL-38999.<BR><BR> 	Body breakaway connectors shall fully separate with a force of 20 pounds ( 3)<BR><BR> 	Soldier worn connectors shall endure at least 1000 disconnect/reconnect cycles without failure<BR><BR> 	Reliability: Mean-Time-Between-Failure (MTBF) of 3200 Hours demonstrated with 90% Lower Confidence Level and Mean-Time-Between-Essential-Function-Failure (MTBEFF) of at least 1600 operational hours demonstrated with 90% Lower Confidence Level<BR><BR> 	Maintainability: Mean-Time-To-Repair (MTTR) of less than 0.5 hours at Unit Maintenance Level and Maintenance Ratio (MR) of < 0.005 Maintenance Man Hours/System Operating Hours.<BR><BR> 	The system uses 18.2 watts nominal power with a peak power of 28 watts (Minimum Voltage: 18Vdc, Nominal Voltage: 28Vdc, Maximum Voltage: 33Vdc, Nominal Current: 650mA, Maximum Current: 1A.<BR><BR> 	Safe to use, install, store, operate, handling, maintain and transport <BR><BR> 	Shall not contain Flourocarbon/polymide (Kapton), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and HC Chrome.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a continued requirement for the sustained production of Non-OxideAdhesive eXperimental  Revision D, or NOAX-D, and the associated processes, in supportof the remaining Space Shuttle Missions beyond January 31, 2011. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Launch Systems, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1,which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies orservices from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agencyrequirements. As such, this mission-critical repair material is available from only onesource and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements this is anoncompetitive procurement. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The development of an on-orbit Crack Repair Material (CRM) for the Space Shuttleorbiter wing leading edge represented a state-of-the-art technological advancement fromthe culmination of several years of evaluation and testing. This advancement is based inpart upon the CRMs ability to be applied in the harsh environs of space and stillsurvive the high temperatures of re-entry. Before the base NOAX-D production contract wasawarded, potential manufacturers were eliminated from consideration due to sub-standardCRM performance in the harsh application environment, restrictive development costs, andschedule constraints. As it remains, NOAX-D supplied solely by ATK, is the only knownrepair material to perform in accordance with the technical requirements imposed by theShuttle Program. 2. ATK Launch Systems is the successful developer of NOAX-D, a mission critical repairmaterial. In addition, ATK alone possesses exhaustive experience with this materialranging from formulation, synthesis, packaging, and application of NOAX-D. Fromdevelopment, preparation, through delivery of this highly specialized material, ATK hassuccessfully performed these processes, meeting the mission essential requirements.Currently, as the CRM experts, ATK is the only qualified vendor that can produce NOAX-Dfor the Agency. A change in source at this point would require an interruptivere-qualification and certification process causing unacceptable budget and scheduleimpacts. 3. This acquisition represents a continuation of effort for the production of the NOAX-Dmaterial. The expense and schedule required to mature another adhesive and qualifyanother vendor to this level would be prohibitive and serve as interruption to themission critical delivery of NOAX-D.

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to solicit proposals for a requirement that is part of the NRC's Financial Accounting and Integrated Management Information System (FAIMIS) business transformation initiative. This initiative allows the agency to achieve a consolidated enterprise financial management information system. This solicitation will include the purchase of enterprise-wide commercial software licenses for a CGI Momentum&reg; Acquisitions module (brand name or equal) that will become a part of the existing CGI Momentum-based FAIMIS system as well as services required to implement that brand name or equal acquisitions module into FAIMIS. <br />Background:</p>
<p>On October 1, 2010, the NRC implemented a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product, CGI's Momentum&reg; (hereafter referred to as "Momentum&reg;") for its Core Financial System (CFS), known at the NRC as the FAIMIS CFS. The FAIMIS CFS includes the following modules: Budget Execution, Purchasing, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Purchase Card, General Ledger, Travel Accounting, Fixed Assets, License Fee Billing, and Cost Accounting. NRC's implementation of Momentum&reg; enabled it to replace multiple legacy stand-alone financial systems, including the legacy Federal Financial System (FFS), which was no longer compliant with Federal standards for financial systems. Overall, the NRC's implementation of Momentum as part of the FAIMIS CFS achieved the following: <br /><br />-Introduced the functional capability to meet current and future NRC financial -reporting requirements through a federally compliant, integrated, user friendly, transparent and efficient COTS system. <br /><br />-Enabled the mitigation of risk of error and ability to maintain effectiveness through consolidation of functionality and processes provided by five, outdated legacy systems and custom solutions developed organically over time. The FAIMIS CFS replaced the Federal Financial System (FFS), the License Fee Billing System (FEES), the Cost Accounting System (CAS), the Advice of Allowance and Financial Plans (AAFP) Spreadsheets and the Capitalized Property System (CPS).<br /><br />-Enabled completion of the first phase of the NRC's vision for an integrated and consolidated enterprise-wide financial management system.<br /><br />-Provided numerous interfaces, one specific FAIMIS CFS interface is an important part of the acquisitions process. FAIMIS CFS interfaces with United States Treasury systems for the disbursement and collections of funds and for debt management reporting, and with the Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) Grant Management System for the management of grant obligations and payments.</p>
<p><br />There are currently approximately 600 users of the FAIMIS CFS. These users are primarily comprised of the agency's budget analysts and clerical and accounting staff from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) as well as the NRC program and regional offices. Most of these individuals are based at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. Approximately 20 additional FAIMIS CFS users from the Department of the Interior's National Business Center (DOI/NBC) in Denver, Colorado currently support processing of Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and entering of obligations in FAIMIS CFS.</p>
<p>The selected commercial item acquisition solution will be integrated into CGI's Momentum&reg; federal financial management solution, NRC's FAIMIS CFS . An integrated FAIMIS acquisition solution will allow NRC to increase efficiency and improve the Agency's internal controls. Through the selected acquisitions solution, the NRC intends to create, store, and maintain documentation and complete transactions relating to commercial contracts, purchase orders, grants, Interagency Agreements (IAAs), cooperative agreements and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) lab agreements.</p>
<p>The acquisitions solution, once implemented, will standardize the finance and acquisitions processes performed by the NRC's Division of Contracts and program and regional offices within a single, transparent business solution. Standardized processes within a single business solution will facilitate increased visibility into financial and contracting practices that have grown organically over time across the NRC program offices. As a result, data integrity will be enhanced by replacing standalone acquisitions systems, custom solutions, spreadsheets and manual interfaces with a single business solution for which data requirements and definitions will be well defined and uniform.</p>
<p>Currently, the FAIMIS CFS is being hosted by the DOI/NBC. With the implementation of the acquisitions solution, the NRC will retain the hosting services of DOI/NBC for FAIMIS and expects the entire FAIMIS solution, including the acquisition solution, to be collocated within a single integrated environment at DOI/NBC. Additionally, the NRC currently pays for a per user licensing fee for FAIMIS CFS.<br /><br /><br />The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable or better proposal is deemed to represent the best value to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered. More specific evaluation factors will be included in the solicitation. The contract will include a two-year base period from date of award (currently estimated to be April 2011), and one (1) six-month option to extend the term of the contract. NO PHONE CALLS RELATING TO THIS NOTICE WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments relating to this acquisition in writing to dominique.malone@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site for the release of the solicitation as it will be made available only on this website. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about January 3, 2011. Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about the response date listed in this notice. Potential offerors are strongly encouraged to check this website frequently for updated information (if any) relating to this acquisition. The anticipated award date is in the April 2011 timeframe.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research seeks innovative sensor concepts, architecture, and hardware for improving the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) of asymmetric threats by providing all weather wide-area persistent surveillance of an operational area. Critical to a successful solution is an all-weather, day-night approach for use when electro-optic techniques are ineffective. The concept would utilize one or more distributed airborne platforms, and is capable of imaging an area of at least 5 by 5 miles, at least 1 foot resolution, with 0.5 Hz updates. Typical footprints are centered between 5 and 100 miles from the airborne platform. The desired output would be video-like radio frequency (RF) imagery of static and moving objects. Typical targets include urban structure, vehicles, and dismounts. Typical environments are urban and littoral areas with moderate to high density vehicle and dismount traffic, strong discrete scattering, blockage and shadowing. It is strongly desired to develop a solution that builds upon, and/or upgrades, an existing military RF sensor capability.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office space in a building under lease in Juneau, Alaska, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 7,300 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related use space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 7,300 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for ten years/five years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 30, 2009.  The building must be located within the following delineated area:

South Boundary: Juneau Airport
North Boundary: Glacier Highway
East Boundary: Jordan
West Boundary: Radcliffe Road

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.

The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety, Seismic Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. 

Please send expressions of interest to the following person and address in writing, via email, or via fax, and provide site address, size and offered square footage, date of space availability, expected rental rate per useable square foot fully-serviced and whether or not the quoted rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.

The Governments decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any Federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of GSA or their authorized representative Studley/LaBonde Land, Inc.  Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord but any properties or proposals submitted by broker/agent must be accompanied by written evidence they are authorized to represent the ownership of the building or property.

Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801<BR>Description<BR>The Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Joint Project Management Office (JPMO), a<BR>component of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEOCBD),<BR>is responsible for the Total Life Cycle Systems Management (TLCSM) of a spectrum of<BR>vaccines, medical devices, assays, and other medical CBD products. As life cycle manager,<BR>CBMS implements, manages, and oversees activities associated with the acquisition,<BR>development, production, fielding, sustainment, and disposal of its products. The Joint Vaccine<BR>Acquisition Program (JVAP) is a product management office within CBMS that focuses on<BR>development and procurement of biological defense vaccines.<BR>This Presolicitation Notice addresses service and support requirements for testing of government<BR>owned CBD materiel, including but not limited to, Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines.<BR>The Contractor will offer and show evidence of the following capabilities:<BR>COMPETITION AND PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE<BR>2<BR>1. Testing:<BR>Contractor will test materiel that includes, but is not limited to, biodefense vaccines<BR>manufactured under Investigational New Drug (IND) regulations per Code of Federal<BR>Regulations, Title 21, Part 312 regulations. Said vaccines help sustain an immunization program<BR>that provides possible protection from tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western<BR>Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q fever.<BR>Contractor will test biodefense vaccine and related materiel in accordance with 21 CFR Part 610<BR>and Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (GLP; 21 CFR Part 58)<BR>standards. The required testing includes sterility testing (21 CFR 610.12, with tests of<BR>bacteriostasis and fungistasis) and specialized potency testing that typically involves<BR>administration of test articles to test animals, followed by challenge with infectious agents. Only<BR>challenges administered by injection are expected, though challenges by inhalation or ingestion<BR>could conceivably be needed. Most of the infectious agents (those of EEE, VEE, tularemia) used<BR>as challenge material are Select Agents within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Select Agent<BR>Program administered by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and<BR>Agriculture (USDA), which published final rules for the possession, use, and transfer of select<BR>agents and toxins (42 C.F.R. Part 73, 7 C.F.R. Part 331, and 9 C.F.R. Part 121). The Department<BR>of Defense has imposed additional requirements for contracts, performance of which requires<BR>access to Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT). See item 2, below. Generally, two lots<BR>of each vaccine will be tested every 12 to 18 months. Potency testing of Q fever vaccine does<BR>not involve challenge with the infectious agent; it involves immunization of test animals and<BR>serological analysis by the complement fixation technique. Potency testing of the Q-fever skin<BR>test antigen involves immunization of test animals and observation and measurement of the<BR>reaction of immunized animals to intradermal administration of test articles.<BR>Contractor may be required to test vaccines for moisture; endotoxin; or other substances, as<BR>may be specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in communications to the IND<BR>sponsor.<BR>Contractor may be required to manufacture challenge material (infectious agents) for potency or<BR>other testing. Such manufacture may be needed if challenge materiel currently in storage is<BR>exhausted or proves to be unsuitable for testing. In general, manufacture would involve the<BR>cultivation of bacteria or viruses, enumeration by standard microbiological methods,<BR>determination of virulence, dispensing into containers suitable for long term cold storage, and<BR>submission to the government of documentation of procedures employed and results obtained.<BR>The government will supply draft test protocols for potency testing, but protocols could be<BR>subject to change during contract performance. The government will not supply standard<BR>operating procedures for common biological research techniques such as animal husbandry,<BR>inoculations, or enumeration of bacteria or viruses; instead, the contractor will need to develop or<BR>acquire such procedures. The government will supply the services of study sponsor and IND<BR>sponsor's representative. The approvals, evidenced by signatures, of the government study<BR>sponsor and IND sponsor are required as part of testing protocol development. Similarly, the<BR>COMPETITION AND PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE<BR>3<BR>government will review draft test reports for compliance with regulatory standards before<BR>accepting the reports.<BR>Contractor will submit animal use protocols for review and approval by the Animal Care and<BR>Use Review Office (ACURO) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.<BR>See Table 1, below for the annual testing requirement.<BR>Table 1 Outline of representative annual testing requirement: The contractor must have the<BR>capability to perform all of these tests each year, but the actual testing to be done by the<BR>contractor each year may be as low as zero tests because the government may choose to perform<BR>some testing in its own facilities, or for other reasons.<BR>EEE vaccine potency, test 2 lots<BR>VEE vaccine (C-84) potency, test 2 lots<BR>VEE vaccine (TC-83) potency, test 2 lots<BR>WEE vaccine potency, test 2 lots<BR>Tularemia vaccine (LVS) potency, test 2 lots<BR>Q-fever vaccine potency, test 2 lots<BR>Q-fever Skin Test Antigen potency, test 2 lots<BR>EEE vaccine sterility, test 2 lots<BR>WEE vaccine sterility, test 2 lots<BR>For a summary of the testing procedures, see Number 5 below:<BR>2. Compliance with Regulations of Biological Select Agents and Toxins<BR>(BSAT):<BR>Contractor will, in all relevant activities, conform to the final rules for the possession, use, and<BR>transfer of select agents and toxins (42 C.F.R. Part 73, 7 C.F.R. Part 331, and 9 C.F.R. Part 121).<BR>In addition, conform to Department of Defense Directive 5210.88; Department of Defense<BR>Instruction 5210.89; and Army Regulations 50-1 and 190-17, all of which impose requirements<BR>that go beyond the regulations administered by the Select Agent Program. Of particular note, the<BR>DoD requires the establishment of a Biological Personnel Reliability Program at each facility in<BR>which access to BSAT is required for contract performance. Contractor will participate in Surety<BR>Management Reviews of compliance with BSAT regulations (estimated frequency, 1 per year;<BR>approximately 3 days in duration) and will support inspections by a team from the office of the<BR>Army Inspector General (estimated frequency, 1 per year, alternating with the Surety<BR>Management Review; approximately 3 days in duration).<BR>COMPETITION AND PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE<BR>4<BR>3. Reporting:<BR>Contractor will report test results in accordance with GLP standards.<BR>Contractor will report, on a monthly basis in Microsoft Word or compatible format, the<BR>following: (a) inventory of stored test articles, with additions or subtractions from inventory<BR>clearly noted; (b) status of testing; and (c) status of compliance with biological surety<BR>regulations, clearly identifying progress on items needing correction, if any.<BR>Contractor will report as required by BSAT regulations.<BR>Contractor will report issues promptly (within 24 hours) as issues arise.<BR>Contractor will report on an annual basis a summary of the information transmitted regularly on<BR>a monthly basis, as well as issues that have arisen.<BR>Contractor will report any inventions made in the course of contract performance.<BR>4. Management and Coordination.<BR>Contractor will manage the work within cost, schedule, and technical parameters. Contractor<BR>will coordinate as needed with the CBMS-JVAP program office and with persons involved in<BR>shipping materials for testing. Contractor will participate in regular monthly teleconferences and<BR>additionally as warranted by circumstances. The Government will perform a Site Visit Annually<BR>or more often as needed.<BR>5.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">RFI for Developing and Implementing an Effective<br />electronic Protocol Authoring (ePA) system</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br />This RFI is issued by SAIC-Frederick</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>This request for information (RFI) is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F). The intent of this RFI is to gather market research. Information gleaned may result in a formal Request for Proposal. Any questions or communications pertaining to this RFI shall only be directed to the SAIC-F Subcontract Specialist. Questions or requests directed to any other individual will not be considered valid, nor will there be a response provided.</p>

<p>Important Dates to Remember:</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFI shall be emailed to the Subcontract Specialist by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 27, 2010.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are due to the Subcontract Specialist by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 19, 2011.</p>
<p>Information Requested:</p>
<p>SAIC-F welcomes your input and comments on an ePA tool/process. We would particularly like your opinions on how to develop and implement an effective ePA system using COTS products. Please bear in mind that the overarching framework for the ePA "application" is that it will be composed of a number of business capability services, associated process services, and bound to an underlying semantic infrastructure and should therefore not be viewed as a "traditional, monolithic application."</p>
<p>Response Instructions</p>
<p>Organizations wishing to respond to this request for information are asked to do so using the attached Response Q&amp;A Template. This attachment includes specific questions that SAIC-F would like organizations to address.</p>
<p>Purpose of RFI:</p>
<p>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) would like to obtain market information regarding the feasibility of developing a process leveraging commercially available software applications to support the development and management of protocol documents for National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported clinical trials. SAIC-F would like to understand the market availability, functional and technical solutions, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and services capable of satisfying the National Cancer Institute (NCI) business, functional, technical, and operational characteristics of electronic Protocol Authoring as described in this RFI. Although titled electronic Protocol Authoring (ePA), the project includes all facets of the protocol development lifecycle including, but not limited to, drafting, authoring, reviewing, modifying, tracking, and managing Letters of Intent (LOI), concepts, protocols, amendments, and other materials associated with NCI clinical trials.<br />The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), within the NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), is responsible for coordinating the largest publicly-funded oncology clinical trials organization in the world (http://ctep.cancer.gov/). The CTEP portfolio includes 900 active trials enrolling 30,000 study participants annually, nearly 400 grants and cooperative agreements, and about 100 investigational new drugs (INDs). CTEP sponsored research spans phase 1 through phase 3 trials in all cancers and treatment modalities -- chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation and surgery. A large portion of CTEP's research portfolio is coordinated through the NCI Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program.</p>
<p>The Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/clinical-trials-cooperative-group) is designed to promote and support clinical trials (research studies) of new cancer treatments, explore methods of cancer prevention and early detection, and study quality of life issues and rehabilitation during and after treatment. Cooperative Groups include researchers, cancer centers, and community physicians throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. They work with the NCI to identify important questions in cancer research and to design clinical trials to answer these questions. The Cooperative Group Program involves more than 3,100 institutions that register or enroll patients to Group conducted clinical trials. More than 14,000 individual investigators are registered to participate in NCI supported Cooperative Group studies. Cooperative Groups place more than 25,000 new patients into cancer treatment clinical trials each year.</p>
<p>The scientific intent and process of a clinical trial is detailed through a research protocol. The protocol describes the research purpose and methodology. Protocol documents also contain safety, regulatory, pharmaceutical, administrative and operational information related to the conduct of the trial. Potential protocols are initially developed and reviewed locally, as pre-protocols (i.e., LOIs or concepts) at Universities, Cancer Centers and Cooperative Groups. LOIs or concepts (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#lois_concepts) that are approved locally are then forwarded to the NCI for review and approval. NCI approved LOIs and concepts are returned to investigators for development into full fledged protocols which undergo a series of contributions and reviews both locally and at the NCI to optimize the trial's scientific and safety profile and ensure all safety, regulatory, administrative, and operational components are accurate and complete. Once finalized, the protocol is distributed as a PDF document by the Groups to investigators at participating sites via the Web. Interested investigators forward the protocol to local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) prior to enrolling patients on the trial. Over the life of a trial, protocols will need to be amended periodically to address evolving scientific, safety, regulatory, and/or administrative changes.</p>
<p>In December 2008, the Operational Efficiency Working Group (OEWG) was established under auspices of the Clinical Trials and Translational Research Advisory Committee (CTAC) to advise the NCI on strategies to reduce the time required to activate NCI sponsored Cooperative Group and early drug development protocols (http://ccct.cancer.gov/files/OEWG-Report.pdf). The OEWG is a broadly constituted panel with representation throughout the oncology community. The OEWG set target dates for the development of protocols based on trial phase. One of the key OEWG recommendations to improve the efficiency of the protocol development lifecycle is to &lsquo;Develop a coordinated approach to standardization of protocol elements and protocol development tools involving NCI, the Cooperative Groups, and the Cancer Centers in order to speed development and review of protocols.'</p>
<p>The ePA initiative is intended to address the OEWG recommendations through identification of secured and standardized tools, content libraries, and processes to facilitate the rapid and efficient development of protocol documents for CTEP treatment trials. A small working group with NCI and Cooperative Group representation has been formed to identify best practices and requirements. The initial impression by the group is that a fully integrated ePA tool(s)/processes would provide the best solution. Integrated ePA applications and processes would support protocol authoring and development using: standard libraries and templates; multi-stage collaborative review with expert and novice users; workflow management, scheduling, communication and tracking to ensure protocols reach target timelines; and collection and sharing of metadata (e.g., milestones and protocol descriptors) to eliminate redundant sequential document abstraction. This would all be packaged in a user friendly web-based PC/Mac and multi-browser compatible application that shall be compliant with Federal regulations (i.e. 508 compliance) and can take advantage of a federated single sign on process. This RFI seeks to determine if there is a single electronic solution to support the ePA process. In the likely event that a single solution is not available then the question is what integrated tools and processes could be packaged together to provide an integrated solution.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the software product and approach identified through this RFI could be used to promote the efficient development of protocols in other NCI programs (e.g., diagnosis, prevention, cancer control, epidemiology). In the future the ePA tools could potentially be tailored to support protocol development in non-oncology (e.g., cardiovascular, diabetes, infectious diseases) arenas.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. This notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the government obligated to issue an RFP. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC.
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response. The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below. The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than January 14, 2011. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile 301-492-3437 or email (Jeffrey.Mitchell@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop TWB-01-B10M Washington, DC 20555.</p>
<p>It is not NRC's intent to publicly disclose any vendor proprietary information obtained during this sources sought notice. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the FOIA and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as "proprietary" or "confidential" will be kept confidential; however, the Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this sources sought notice. It is emphasized that this notice is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as any commitment by the Government. Due to a variety of limitations, the NRC does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this sources sought notice. Pre-solicitation and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest.</p>
<p>Brief Description of Requirement</p>
<p>The NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) is responsible for providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 of the SRP, NUREG-0800 provides guidance for review of the instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) portions of applications for nuclear reactor licenses or permits, and amendments to existing licenses. This guidance has also been applied in the review of topical reports submitted to NRC for safety evaluation, especially reports requesting generic acceptance of systems or components that may be used in nuclear power plant I&amp;C safety systems. The current structure of Chapter 7 of the SRP consists of an overview of the I&amp;C review process, followed by subsections addressing systems that include references to I&amp;C guidance, appendices that provide specific guidance for meeting regulatory requirements, and branch technical positions (BTPs) that address specific issues. Additionally, Chapter 7 of the SRP provides links to several Regulatory Guides (RGs) and NUREGs that provide additional information on meeting regulatory requirements for I&amp;C safety systems. More recently, the staff developed Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) to resolve technical and regulatory challenges associated with digital technology. While the current version of Chapter 7 of the SRP for I&amp;C continues to be adequate for reviewing applications or amendments to existing licenses in the I&amp;C area, there are areas where it can be improved.</p>
<p>NRC seeks assistance in assessing the existing framework of regulations and guidance relevant to I&amp;C and developing a dynamic electronic support system to assist in the review of licensing applications. This electronic support system will: (1) provide correlation of requirements and guidance; (2) implement a computer-based set of tools for evaluation and templates to document safety assessments; (3) provide long-term knowledge management and organizational experience sharing; (4) improve consistency in the regulatory decision-making process across the licensing offices; and (5) help new technical reviewers achieve the required level of knowledge and performance in the fastest possible time with minimum support from other staff members.</p>
<p>The program manager, key personnel, and any other senior technical staff that will be performing work shall have expertise and/or experience in the following key areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experience in the regulations and guidance of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in applicable laws and requirements, or equivalent experience in understanding regulatory requirements and associated regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with the NRC's regulatory process described in Chapter 7 of the SRP, including the applicability of RGs, NUREGs, SECY papers, Generic Letters, Information Notices, Regulatory Issue Summaries, ISGs, and relevant industry standards, to the extent sufficient that the process can be applied to the proposed electronic-based support system.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience developing knowledge based systems, including the infrastructure supporting technology necessary to build and operate knowledge management systems, a means for acquiring knowledge and storing it in a computer-compatible representation, a means for storing a body of knowledge along with functionality for accessing and searching the knowledge, and timely delivery of knowledge to individuals who may require or benefit from the information in conducting their work tasks.</p>
<p>Responses should be submitted in MS Word and/or MS Excel format and include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Describe experience and publications that demonstrate the respondent's capabilities in these areas.</p>
<p>2. Show that all personnel and organizations that may provide technical services in these efforts on behalf of the respondent meet all of the qualifications specified above, or that specific qualifications are not applicable to specific persons or organizations.</p>
<p>3. Describe any schedule or resource issues that may constrain the respondent's:</p>
<p>a. submittal of a detailed formal proposal in response to a request issued within several months of the date of this sources sought notice, and</p>
<p>b. execution of the efforts described herein, in the event work were to be requested to begin within one year of the date of this sources sought notice (NRC intends to be flexible in the scheduling of the work described herein, in recognition of respondent constraints).</p>
<p>4. Provide any other documentation or evidence that the respondent believes demonstrates appropriate qualification and capabilities. Respondent should recognize that clarity and concision will be considered germane.</p>
<p>5. Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number. <br />How long has your company been in operation? What type of business is your company (i.e., small, 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, etc.)?</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes that only solicitation quotes/proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The USAF can meet its minimum needs only by procuring a hydraulic supply kit for a K400B-XL test stand produced by Avtron Aerospace. Only Avtron aerospace has the capability of producing these replacement parts due to the fact that they own rights to the replacement parts and the original test stand. Given the proprietary nature of these replacement parts, reverse engineering is not an option in that it may result in patent infringement issues as well as produce excessive costs.</p>
<p>AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), JUSTIFICATION: SUPPLIES REQUIRED ARE FROM ONLY ONE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESPONSIBLE SOURCE(S) AND NO OTHER TYPE OF SUPPLIES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR Part 13. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received prior to the closing date on the solicitation will be considered by the government.

Specification, plans, or drawing relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the government. The government does not own the data or rights to the data needed to purchase the item from additional sources.</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a sole source contract. The contractor (Avtron) will provide (1) Hydraulic Supply Kit for a K400B-XL Generator Test Stand, Contracting by Negotiation. The solicitation will posted at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under solicitation number FA8224-11-T-0014 on or around December 16, 2010. This requirement is considered sole source due to the fact the test stands are proprietary to Avtron and all parts required for maintenance are also proprietary to Avtron. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and all other interested contractors shall submit a capabilities document which states their abilities on fulfilling this requirement. Responses should be submitted by 11:30 am MST on December 21. The Contract Negotiator information is listed below:</p>

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

		(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing Refresh #6 to solicitation number FBGT-GG-050001-B for Multiple Award Schedule 48 Transportation, Delivery & Relocation Solutions which is effective on December 17, 2010.  

In compliance with FAS Instructional Letter (IL) 2010-09, this Refresh #6, implements the Requirement for Reporting Executive Compensation and First-tier Subcontract Awards.  The new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause, 52.204-10, is required in all solicitations, existing contracts, and new contract awards valued at $25,000 or more that are not classified or awarded to an individual.  In general, the reporting requirements require that all contractors report first-tier subcontract award information and annually report the contractor's and first-tier subcontractors' five most highly paid executives for the contractor and subcontractor's preceding completed fiscal year.  The requirements originated from the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282), aimed at empowering the American taxpayer with information that may be used to demand greater fiscal discipline and accountability from the Federal Government.  

Resultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under GSA's Multiple Award Schedule program.  Current contract holders under Schedule 48 for Transportation, Delivery & Relocation Solutions do not need to re-apply.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency.

<p><span style="COLOR: red; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) mission is to s</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">ave lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes, through education, research, safety standards and enforcement activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">For a vehicle to be sold in the United States (US) it must be certified in accordance with certain specific Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each FMVSS specifies different performance standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NHTSA engineers routinely examine electronic data channels collected in these tests to ensure that the tests were conducted to the proper speed, acceleration, and / or duration levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Additionally, many standards require an Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) that contains sensors which must meet specific injury criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of these injury criteria requires application of specific digital filters and / or time series analysis to evaluate compliance with the safety regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these computations work with data recorded during a variety of crash/sled tests and often the measurements need to be correlated with test videos to understand what happened at the time high measurements were recorded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Presently, NHTSA has to convert the data provided to it into a usable format for internally developed software, and now wishes to use a software package that is available from the commercial market place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the last 30 years, NHTSA has primarily relied upon custom software generated by federal engineering staff to evaluate the crash test measured signals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the electronic test data is stored in a central database and the custom software determines the appropriate signals, applies appropriate filters and mathematical calculations to evaluate test performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">NHTSA also performs research to develop new vehicle and ATD performance requirements to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once NHTSA engineers have developed a test procedure or injury criteria, he or she has to ask a programmer to produce a package that will read in the data from a database and perform the analysis specified by the engineer.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">NHTSA is seeking to utilize a commercially available off-the shelf (COTS) software package to perform FMVSS calculations, which would eliminate the need to maintain custom software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also required that any COTS software considered shall have some form of scripting capability to allow NHTSA engineers to develop new test and injury criteria as they advance the state of the art for crash testing and injury prediction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA desires that its engineering staff have the ability to develop macros or scripts to automate new test analysis procedures. </span></p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Science Writer/Curator, NIST Lobby Information Center</p>
<p>1.BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks an experienced science writer/curator to lead a one-year project to develop museum quality exhibits for its headquarters site in Gaithersburg, MD and its Boulder, Colo., laboratories site.</p>
<p>An agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce established in 1901, NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. It carries out this mission through four main programs:</p>
<p>&bull; The NIST Laboratories, conducting research that advances the nation's technology infrastructure and is needed by U.S. industry to continually improve products and services.</p>
<p>&bull; The Baldrige National Quality Program, which promotes performance excellence among U.S. manufacturers, service companies, educational institutions, health care providers, and nonprofit organizations; conducts outreach programs and manages the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award which recognizes performance excellence and quality achievement.</p>
<p>&bull; The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nationwide network of local centers offering technical and business assistance to manufacturers.<br /><br />&bull; The Technology Innovation Program, which provides cost-shared awards to industry, universities, and consortia for research on potentially revolutionary technologies that address critical national and societal needs.</p>
<p>Additional information about NIST programs is available on the NIST World Wide Web site at: http://www.nist.gov</p>
<p>More than 15,000 people visit NIST Gaithersburg and Boulder each year for professional conferences, to discuss projects with NIST employees, or to provide services to NIST. In addition, more than 1500 students visit NIST each year for field trips, science fairs, and other special programs.</p>
<p>The lobby of the NIST Administration Bldg. is the primary reception space for these visitors in Gaithersburg. Currently the space includes a 2,500 square foot exhibit created in 2001 of museum quality displays. The space also includes a reception area, seating and tables for small groups that need space for impromptu meetings, directional signs, and a selection of NIST publications.</p>
<p>The NIST Boulder lobby area serves a similar purpose but is substantially smaller with about 500 square feet available for displays.</p>
<p>NIST has hired a contractor, to design a new set of displays for the Administration Bldg. lobby area. A request for proposals to hire a designer for the Boulder lobby area will be issued once the contractor for science writer/curator for the project, has been selected.</p>
<p>2. SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, administration and technical execution of this contract. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>a. Review background materials about NIST's mission and history, draft exhibit content outlines prepared by NIST, and the NIST Web site to become familiar with NIST accomplishments and current programs that will be highlighted in the new exhibits.<br /><br />b. Coordinate project leadership for both the Gaithersburg and Boulder exhibit development, design, implementation, and installation projects with the NIST COTR.</p>
<p>c. Use the draft NIST content outline and the results of exhibit brainstorming sessions, interviews with NIST experts, visitor feedback, and other materials or data to develop a theme or themes for each exhibit, and to write a detailed content outline (about 1000-1500 words) that describes a set of cohesive text panels, objects, interactives, multi-media displays and other elements to be developed that support the overarching theme(s).</p>
<p>d. Provide recommendations for the consideration of the NIST Public Affairs exhibit team members, the exhibit designers, and the advisory panels to reach consensus on a detailed content, design, interactives, and multimedia, plan.<br /><br />e. Provide recommendations for the consideration by the Public Affairs COTR and the exhibit designers to prepare a detailed timeline of deliverables to ensure completion of both the Gaithersburg and Boulder projects by Nov. 30, 2011.</p>
<p>f. Write and edit all panel text, captions, and other content for NIST COTR consideration for the Gaithersburg and Boulder exhibits including text required for interactive media programs included in the exhibits. (While the amount of text required for the new exhibits is not yet known, the current displays in Gaithersburg include panels, captions, and interactive media text of about 8,000 words.)</p>
<p>g.

<DESC>Solicitation N00167-11-T-5001 is being issued pursuant to the procedures at FAR subpart 13 and synopsis exception FAR 5.202(a)(13) applies. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has identified a need for technical services to assist NSWCCD engineers in assessing the capabilities of current and near-future actuator and sensor technologies for use in measuring mechanical impedances onboard ships. Code 7220 is the Structural Acoustic and Target Strength Research Branch in the Signature Control Technology Division of the Signatures Department and is involved in directing research and development work toward new or improved submarine components. Actuators and sensors are needed for measuring mechanical impedances of submarine components.Actuator and sensor technologies cover a wide range of electro-mechanical materials, mechanisms, and attachment conditions.
 Example actuator technologies are moving armature shakers (single-point attachments) and piezoceramics stacks (two-point intrastructural attachments). Example sensor technologies are accelerometers (single-point) and piezoelectric strips. Assessment criteria for actuators include blocked force level, latency, power efficiency, bandwidth, linearity, robustness, reliability, environmental sensitivity, manufacturability, and cost. Assessment criteria for sensors include sensitivity, latency, linearity, bandwidth, robustness, reliability, environmental sensitivity, manufacturability, and cost.  To acquire the needed services, NSWCCD intends to conduct a non-competitive procurement with Summit Applied Research (SAR), Summit, NJ 07901.
 SAR is currently the only vendor with experience in the design, development, installation, and operation of distributed sensors and high-power, high-force, low latency actuators in a harsh undersea operational environment. Summit High-power actuators as envisioned for the project require high current switch-capacitor technology of the kind developed by SAR for specialized Navy application. SAR is also the only vendor, past or present, with the knowledge of the particular naval architecture needed to perform this work. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
 All submissions received on or before 24 December 2010 will be considered by the Government. Please reference RFQ N00167-11-T-5001 with all correspondence.

<p>A contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract as a result of SSA making an unfavorable suitability determination on contractor employees.&nbsp; Additionally, if SSA determines that the number or percentage of unfavorable determinations make successful contract performance unlikely, SSA may terminate the contract for cause or default.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp; Exceptions<br />The COTR may request an exception to the normal background investigation process for emergency situations when access to a facility or site is needed, but where access to information systems or programmatic information is not required.&nbsp; This request must be directed to CPSPM.&nbsp; COTRs may request an exception by sending an email to dchr.ope.hspd12appeals@ssa.gov.&nbsp; If CPSPM grants temporary access, that temporary access will apply only for the period specified by CPSPM and only for the specific contract employee(s) identified by the COTR.&nbsp; CPSPM expects that it will rarely grant exceptions.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp; Contractor Notification to Government<br />The contractor shall notify the COTR (who will notify CPSPM and the CO) within one business day if an employee is arrested or charged with a crime during the term of this contract, or if there is any other change in the employee's status (e.g., the employee leaves the company; the employee no longer works under the contract; the employee's alien status changes) that could impact the suitability determination for that individual.&nbsp; The contractor must provide in that notification as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to:&nbsp; employee name(s), contract number, the type of charge(s), if applicable, the court date, and, if available, the disposition of the charge(s).</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; Government Control<br />The Government has full control over and may grant, deny, or withhold access to a facility, site, system, or information and may require the COTR and contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract for reasons related to conduct even after the individual has been found suitable to work on the contract (see paragraph n., below).</p>
<p>m.&nbsp; Appeals Process for Unsuitable Determinations<br />The contractor must notify the employee of any unsuitable determinations as soon as possible after receipt of such a determination.&nbsp; If the employee would like clarification or wish to appeal an unsuitable determination, his/her request must be in writing and submitted within 30 days of the date of the unsuitable determination.&nbsp; The request can be emailed to SSA at<br />dchr.ope.hspd 12 appeals@ssa.gov, or mailed to:</p>
<p>Social Security Administration<br />Attn:&nbsp; CPSPM Suitability Program Officer<br />6401 Security Boulevard<br />Room 1260 Dunleavy Building<br />Baltimore, MD&nbsp; 21235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>n&nbsp; Removal From Duty</p>
<p>SSA may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working under the contract based on conduct that occurs after a pre-screening approval or favorable suitability determination.&nbsp; The contractor must comply with these requests.&nbsp; The Government's determination may be made based on, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set forth below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Violation of the Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds, 41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-20.3.&nbsp; This includes any local badging requirements.</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Nguyen Manh Tung<br />Deputy Director<br />Customs Modernization and Reform Board<br />3rd Floor, Silver Wings Building<br />137A Nguyen Van Cu Street<br />Long Bien District<br />Hanoi, Vietnam<br />Fax: +84 4 220 7600</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the National Single Window Customs Project.</p>
<p>The General Department of Viet Nam Customs ("Grantee") has requested USTDA feasibility study funding support to identify and recommend how to implement a National Single Window Customs project. In December 2005, the Government of Vietnam agreed to establish and implement a national single window system by 2011, which would help meet the commitment to implement an overall Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Single Window system by 2012. The Vietnam National Single Window project aims to expedite and simplify clearances and information processing and to reduce the cost of trade transactions between Vietnam and its trading partners. Specifically, the single window project will provide one entrance, either physical or electronic, for the submission and handling of all data and documents related to the release and clearance of an international customs transaction.</p>
<p>Viet Nam Customs seeks a qualified U.S. contractor to conduct a feasibility study, under USTDA's funding, which will identify the system requirements associated with the single window solution. Specifically, the study will include a gap analysis, evaluate standardized customs documents and data, identify institutional changes and data models that must be adopted, and outline the implementation plan for project deployment. This USTDA-funded study follows USAID support to help draft Vietnam's National Single Window Master Plan and complement on-going work focused on reforming Vietnam's customs legislation and regulation. The selected feasibility study contractor will coordinate its work with the USAID-funded team who continue to provide support to Vietnam Customs focused on legislative and regulatory reform. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $718,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<DESC>**** Please contact Harold Smith only for questions or to submit quotes atHarold.Smith-1@NASA.GOV.****  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO.1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STEEL PLATESBARS AND BEAMS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions which have been generated from thissolicitation.QUESTIONS:1.On one of the items for Solicitation Number NNM11366250Q.You have one 12' piece of 3.00" X 2-1/2" X 3/16" Rectangular Tube. Is this the correctsize? Would  3-1/2" X 2-1/2" X 3/16" Rectangular Tube be acceptable.ANSWER:Yes, we are willing to accept the suggested change in size for the rectangular tube;3-1/2" X 2-1/2" X 3/16".QUESTION:2. Item #13 on specification sheet - 3" x 2-1/2" x 3/16" Rect. Tube. This is not a goodsize normally, could you use an alternate size such as 3" x 3" x 3/16"? Or what othersize could you use instead?ANSWER:Yes please see question 1.QUESTION:3. On the above-referenced solicitation, you are calling out A36 on the HSS sections. The A36 equivalent for HSS is actually ASTM A500 Grade B.  On the 1" x 3/16" flat bar,the mild carbon equivalent to A36 will	most likely be a C1018, or perhaps C1018 coldfinished bar.  Both are  "better" than A36 because they have tighter tolerances, and they should be much more readily available. The 1/8 x 2ft x 2ft might be A36, or it may be ahot rolled sheet spec. Plates that are rolled as plate in that thickness are much more expensive than plates that are flattened from sheet coil.  Are you willing to accept amaterial change?ANSWER:  The suggested material changes do not appear to be technically unfeasible, but willlikely increase costs.	If the vender wishes to submit a bid based on the alternativematerials, that would be acceptable though not advisable.The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 12/23/2010 by 12:00 P.m. CST.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 12/13/2010.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Science Writer/Curator, NIST Lobby Information Center</p>
<p>1.BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks an experienced science writer/curator to lead a one-year project to develop museum quality exhibits for its headquarters site in Gaithersburg, MD and its Boulder, Colo., laboratories site.</p>
<p>An agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce established in 1901, NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. It carries out this mission through four main programs:</p>
<p>&bull; The NIST Laboratories, conducting research that advances the nation's technology infrastructure and is needed by U.S. industry to continually improve products and services.</p>
<p>&bull; The Baldrige National Quality Program, which promotes performance excellence among U.S. manufacturers, service companies, educational institutions, health care providers, and nonprofit organizations; conducts outreach programs and manages the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award which recognizes performance excellence and quality achievement.</p>
<p>&bull; The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nationwide network of local centers offering technical and business assistance to manufacturers.<br /><br />&bull; The Technology Innovation Program, which provides cost-shared awards to industry, universities, and consortia for research on potentially revolutionary technologies that address critical national and societal needs.</p>
<p>Additional information about NIST programs is available on the NIST World Wide Web site at: http://www.nist.gov</p>
<p>More than 15,000 people visit NIST Gaithersburg and Boulder each year for professional conferences, to discuss projects with NIST employees, or to provide services to NIST. In addition, more than 1500 students visit NIST each year for field trips, science fairs, and other special programs.</p>
<p>The lobby of the NIST Administration Bldg. is the primary reception space for these visitors in Gaithersburg. Currently the space includes a 2,500 square foot exhibit created in 2001 of museum quality displays. The space also includes a reception area, seating and tables for small groups that need space for impromptu meetings, directional signs, and a selection of NIST publications.</p>
<p>The NIST Boulder lobby area serves a similar purpose but is substantially smaller with about 500 square feet available for displays.</p>
<p>NIST has hired a contractor, to design a new set of displays for the Administration Bldg. lobby area. A request for proposals to hire a designer for the Boulder lobby area will be issued once the contractor for science writer/curator for the project, has been selected.</p>

This will be determined by evaluating the non-pricing factors of the RFQ (including the subfactors), and the pricing factors or price to the Government.  Competing proposals shall be evaluated against the requirements of the solicitation in order to express their strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUATION FACTORS<BR>GENERAL:<BR><BR>1.  These instructions are designed to provide general guidance for preparing proposals as well as providing instructions on proposal organization, format and content.  The Offeror's proposals should include all documents and information requested and should be submitted in accordance with the instructions.  The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with instructions set forth in this solicitation.  A proposal that omits material elements required by the RFQ may be eliminated from further consideration.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received without discussions.<BR><BR>2.  The proposal should be clear, concise, and include adequate detail for effective evaluation.  The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the information presented in the offeror's proposals.  <BR><BR> <BR>PROPOSAL CONTENT AND FORMAT:<BR><BR>1.  In order to provide all necessary information for a comprehensive technical evaluation and price analysis, offerors must submit a proposal in three (3) separate sections and be clearly and concisely written as well as being indexed and logically assembled.  Proposals should be clearly stated so that Government personnel with general training can make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether the services proposed would satisfy the stated requirements.<BR><BR>2.  PART 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH FACTOR  <BR><BR>a. Offerors must submit written data to support their understanding of the requirement and their proposed means of fulfilling the requirement.  Offerors should provide a complete narrative for each element listed under the Technical Approach Subfactors as stated below.  NOTE:  Statements that "the Offeror understands", "can or will comply with all specifications", statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as "standard procedures will be used" or "well known techniques will be used" will be considered insufficient and could render the proposal as unacceptable.<BR><BR>	b.  Subfactor 1:  Experience of Personnel:<BR><BR>(1)	Demonstrate expertise and experience of personnel proposed to perform the services as well as equipment and supplies that will be used to perform the required tasks<BR><BR>(2)	Describe and provide documentation of all applicable certifications, licenses, permits, (i.e. State Electrician Licenses, OSHA/NFPA/IEEE/NETA compliant certifications etc.) for instructors.  Include documentation of personnel experience in providing similar services to those identified in the overall Performance Work Statement.  <BR><BR>c.  Subfactor 2:  Scheduling of Tasks:<BR><BR>(1)	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the all the technical features involved in performing the tasks identified in the overall contract Performance Work Statement (i.e. Detailed Course Outlines with tentative  and course material samples for some specified requirements).   <BR><BR>3.  PART 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR <BR><BR>a.  Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, will be used to make a determination of the level of performance risk associated with each offeror.  Offerors should provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least three prior contracts that are similar in size and scope and complexity to this requirement,  performed within the last five (5) years.  References should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractor to be used.   Offerors should provide the following:<BR><BR>		Reference:  Name, Address, POC and phone Numbers<BR>		Contract, Value, and Dates:<BR>		Description of the Contract Effort:<BR>                             Relevance to this Solicitation:<BR>	<BR>b.  Each Offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior efforts for similar services .  The offeror may include an overall narrative explaining what aspects of the contract efforts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, as well as significant accomplishments and difficulties.   Offerors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information and the Government does not assume the responsible for conducting research as a result of incorrect reference information of any kind.  The references should be provided in descending order, with the most relevant contracts appearing first.<BR><BR>               c.  Performance information will be used for both the  responsibility determination  as well as an evaluation factor.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.<BR><BR>                d.  Offerors may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate exceptional capacity to provide the service or product described in Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>                e. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror.  USACE shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information.<BR><BR><BR>4.  PART 3 - PRICE FACTOR.  <BR><BR>	a.  The Offeror's Price proposal must consist of the signed copy of the SF 1449 and total prices for the services requested for the Base and Option Periods included on the Continuation Page of the SF 1449.  It is expected that this contract will be awarded based upon a determination that there was adequate price competition; therefore, the offeror is not required to submit or certify cost or pricing data.  However, after receipt of proposals, if the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition does not exist in accordance with FAR 15.804-3, the offeror shall be required to provide cost or pricing data.<BR><BR> <BR>5.  BASIS FOR AWARD:<BR><BR>	a.  Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the U.S. Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.   The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with all instructions set forth or referenced in this solicitation.  A proposal that omits material elements required by the RFQ may be eliminated from further consideration.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the Government's best interests and in accordance with the criteria set forth in this solicitation.  <BR><BR>              b.  The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of each Offeror's proposal.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the Evaluation Factors/Criteria identified above.  It is important that Offerors possess a complete understanding of what each factor requires and accurately interprets their relative order of importance when preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.  The cumulative relative importance of the non-pricing evaluation factors is significantly more important when compared to the pricing factor.<BR>  <BR>              c. Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance with the Technical Approach Factor being significantly more important than Past Performance Factor.  Subfactors listed under Technical approach are of equal importance.<BR><BR>d.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.

<DESC><p><br />SUBJECT: FA9422-11-R-0002 <br />NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE TRACKING SYSTEM (NETS)<br />17 December 2010</p>
<p>This announcement is issued in response to questions received regarding an RFP release date. It is anticipated that the RFP will be released on Monday 20 December 2010 or very soon thereafter. The anticipated due date for proposals is expected to be 24 January 2011. All interested parties should pay special attention to this announcement as any updates or changes to any information regarding this requirement will be posted here.</p>
<p><br />SUBJECT: FA9422-11-R-0002 AMENDMENT 3<br />NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE TRACKING SYSTEM (NETS)</p>
<p>CS/Phone: Francine M. Chavez / 505-853-2483<br />Date: 06 December 2010</p>
<p>Amendment 3 is issued in response to questions received regarding the Draft RFP, dated <br />9 Nov 10, and the 23 Nov 10 acquisition strategy change posting on FedBizzOpps.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING</p>
<p>RFI #1: Comment: In attachment 3 Addendum to FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008) there are some inconsistencies with Table 2.2- Proposal Organization (Page 3 of 24) and the written instructions in the rest of this portion of the document. Specifically, the table lists Volume III as the Cost/Price volume and Volume IV as the Relevant Past Performance volume. In the text of the same attachment, (Page 9 of 24) Section 5.0 lists Volume III as Past Performance whereas (Page 11 of 24) Section 6.0 lists Volume IV as Cost/Price. Question: Will the Air Force clarify the ordering of the Volumes for the response in the Final RFP?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on our change in acquisition strategy, Table 2.2 is updated to reflect Vol. III and Instructions to Offerors (ITO) paragraph 5.0 as Cost/Price. Contract documentation becomes Vol. IV and ITO paragraph 6.0. The Past Performance volume is deleted.</p>
<p>RFI#2: Comment: Attachment 3 Addendum to FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008) Table 2.2 Proposal Organization (Page 4 of 24) lists the Relevant Past Performance as being limited to 3 citations, 5 pages per citation (plus questionnaires). In section 5.3.4 Past Performance Volume Contents the wording is "(3 relevant contracts, limited to 3 pages each)" with no mention of the questionnaire forms. Question: Please provide the corrected requirements for Past Performance citations.</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#3: Comment: In reference to the Past Performance Volume Contents, section 5.3 Relevant Contracts states that industry is to "...include information on no more than three (3) recent contracts performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors..."</p>
<p>Question 1: Will these additional relevant contracts be limited to 5 pages per citation plus questionnaires in the same manner as the prime vendors' relevant contracts?</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>Question 2: Is there a limit to the total number of Past Performance contracts (3 for the Prime and 3 for each partner/significant subcontractor)?</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#4: Comment: In reference to the same section (Past Performance Volume Contents, section 5.3 Relevant Contracts), if the AF's intent that the number of past performance citations for the Prime and any teaming partners be limited to three (3) in total, Praeses respectfully requests that the total be increased to five (5).</p>
<p>Answer: Past Performance requirements are deleted in their entirety.</p>
<p>RFI#5: Question: Organization of CDRLs due at proposal submittal not provided. What are the DiDs for the CDRLs (Demo &amp; Dev Plans)? DI-MGMT-80004(?)</p>
<p>Answer: The CDRLs and corresponding DiDs are presently under construction.</p>
<p>RFI#6: Question: There seems to be a typo. Should section 5.3 refer to Vol III instead of Vol IV?</p>
<p>Answer: Based on our change in acquisition strategy, Table 2.2 is updated to reflect Vol. III and Instructions to Offerors (ITO) paragraph 5.0 as Cost/Price. Contract documentation becomes Vol. IV and ITO paragraph 6.0. The Past Performance volume is deleted.</p>
<p>RFI#7: Question: There seems to be conflicting instructions. Should there be a delivery of all volumes on one CD or one CD per volume?</p>
<p>Answer: All volumes may be placed on a single CD, space permitting, and each volume shall be in a different directory on the CD. Use separate files to permit rapid location of all portions, including subfactors, exhibits, annexes, and attachments, if any. If files are compressed, the necessary decompression program must be included. If there is not adequate space on a single CD then clearly identify on each CD the Volume number(s) located within the CD.</p>
<p>RFI#8: Question: The FedBizOps web page for the NETS solicitation indicates this acquisition is not a set aside, whereas the draft SF 1449 (page 1 of the draft RFP package) indicates this is 100% set aside for a small business. Please clarify which of these is correct.</p>
<p>Answer: Based on change in acquisition strategy, this will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses. Small business proposals will be evaluated first using technically acceptable criteria to rank order them. Contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified small business offerors, dependent on availability of funds. Once the small business list of proposals is exhausted, large business proposals will be evaluated and rank ordered according to the same technically acceptable criteria. Again, contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified offerors, dependent on availability of funds.</p>
<p>RFI#9: Comment: Considering that this solicitation is looking for an existing commercial device that can be modified/updated to provide the desired capabilities in such a short time span, it would be advantageous to the Air Force to release this acquisition as &lsquo;Unrestricted', allowing large businesses with the commensurate internal resources and Quality Assurance/Quality Control capabilities to ensure a successful solution.</p>
<p>Answer: As stated above, based on change in acquisition strategy, this will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses.</p>
<p>RFI#10: Question: Can you please clarify the statements bolded below? If we deliver the development plan after the demonstration, why is the development plan needed, if the demonstration is over? Is this just a simple developmental plan that is something for ya'll to be aware of, if at any time in the future, there may be carried out in another round of funding, which you stated clearly as was not coming?</p>
<p>Answer: Since we do not expect any one contractor will be able to satisfy all product outcomes or objectives, the development plan will explain how the demonstrated technology can be further developed/improved to fulfill the areas the technology demonstration did not address (activities, cost, and schedule). The development plan is in intended to help us to potentially build a requirement should there be follow-on funding.</p>
<p>RFI#11: Question: What is the timeline for "after the receipt of the demo"? Does this mean, we conduct the tech demo and then hand you immediately a rough-order-of-magnitude demo plan? The development plan will be required after receipt of the demonstration vice being due at the time of the proposal. The development plan will be a rough-order of-magnitude on what activities, cost and schedule would be required to further develop the technology.</p>
<p>Answer: The primary proposal submission will consist of the demonstration plan. The demonstration report and development plan will be during the course of the contract. The demonstration report will be due no later than 30 days after the formal technology demonstration. The development plan (a rough order of magnitude including activities, cost and schedule required to further develop the technology) will be required no later than 30 days after the technology demonstration report is delivered. The total period of performance is 210 days.</p>
<p>RFI#12: Question: Does the statement that this contract will be 100% small business set aside mean 100% of the effort must be done by a small business, or just that 100% of the multiple awards will be to small businesses?</p>
<p>Answer: The acquisition will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses. Small businesses must demonstrate performance of 50% or more of the effort in order to be considered qualified and awardable. Large businesses will be considered for award after the small business proposal list has been exhausted.</p>
<p>RFI#13: Question: The current posted statement of objectives (SOO) is dated 22 September 2010 yet we have downloaded another dated 09 November 2010 from a different posting. What is the latest date for the Statement of Objectives?</p>
<p>Answer: Most recently posted version is the SOO, dated 9 Nov 10, posted in the Draft RFP.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL</p>
<p>RFI#1: Question: Are these the only requirements for a bio-metrically secure handheld computing device?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the handheld device will have to demonstrate biometric security to safeguard information but there is no predisposition on a possible solution. Demonstration of any and all capabilities the device can currently perform is acceptable.</p>
<p>RFI#2: Question: What is considered to be "local command and Control"?</p>
<p>Answer: This refers to on-the-scene munitions squadrons, groups, numbered AF, MAJCOMs, COCOMs, etc.</p>
<p>RFI#3: Question: Does the government need visibility into asset location while they are in flight or in transit? TAV 24/7 or something less?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, we have to be able to track when and on what they are associated with. The Air Force in interested in ultimately being able to track any and all components 24/7.</p>
<p>RFI#4: Question: Is the government presently using UID/RFID technologies to track/monitor nuclear assets?</p>
<p>Answer: RFID is not used, unique serial numbering is used.</p>
<p>RFI#5: Question: Is the government looking for Cradle to Grave Total Asset Visibility?</p>
<p>Answer: The Air Force is interested in ultimately being able to track any and all components.</p>
<p>RFI#6: Question: What does the Air Force nuclear enterprise consist of? i.e., Land based as well as Aircraft.</p>
<p>Answer: The Air Force nuclear enterprise consists of a number of weapons systems, nuclear policies, procedures, and processes affecting nuclear operations. This includes the management, sustainment, and logistics of nuclear weapons-related material.</p>
<p>RFI#7: Question: How many items will be an acceptable number for the demonstration?</p>
<p>Answer: We have no predisposed solution so demonstration of any and all capabilities is acceptable. Offerors may demonstrate multiple solutions during their technology demonstration and the demonstration in its entirety shall not exceed a single day.</p>
<p>RFI#8: Question: Does SIPRNET interface well with the AF-GIG? Is the AF-GIG classified?</p>
<p>Answer: Parts of AF-GIG are classified (SIPRNET aspect) so SIPRNET does interface with AF-GIG.</p>
<p>RFI#9: Question: If there a requirement to transmit data from a classified to unclassified (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) environment?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>RFI#10: Question: Are the CAS and DIAMONDS systems NOT NOW considered subject to interfacing for the demonstration?</p>
<p>Answer: Correct, there is no requirement to demonstrate CAS and DIAMONDS interface. Demonstrations are to be conducted in a relevant environment at contractor facilities to demonstrate capability offered.</p>
<p>RFI#11: Question: What are the general characteristics of the anticipated/specific &lsquo;Trigger Points' that will send applicable data in the data tracking/monitoring process?</p>
<p>Answer: The general characteristics of the trigger points will be hand-off and transition of accountability from one entity to another (i.e. any movement must be tracked).</p>
<p>RFI#12: Question: What are the existing data systems (and associated detailed characteristics/'Trigger Points') from which the information required to satisfy the "...verify user credentials, personnel reliability status and currency/training qualifications"?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>
<p>RFI#13: Question: What percentage of nuclear assets is presently marked with UID?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge of Air Force systems is not a contract requirement, this information will not be provided.</p>
<p>RFI#14: Question: Are nuclear legacy assets being marked during maintenance activities commonly referred to as "Trigger Points"?</p>
<p>Answer: See the answer to RFI#11 above.</p>
<p>RFI#15: Question: Are all assets currently maintained using the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)?</p>
<p>Answer: Multiple systems are used to include IMDS.</p>
<p>RFI#16: Question: Is the IMDS currently being used to capture UID data/information?</p>
<p>Answer: No, not for all items.</p>
<p>RFI#17: Question: Will all existing/known issues discussed in Para 1.0 of the Instructions to Offerers Attachment be disclosed as part of the final RFP?</p>
<p>Answer: No, based on change in acquisition strategy, this is no longer relevant and it will be deleted from the final RFP.</p>
<p>RFI#18: Question: Please clarify how the Intellectual Property rights for any existing tool/capability that is used as the basis/foundation for the selected IT solution would be protected, ie, remain with the originating company?</p>
<p>Answer: The appropriate intellectual property clauses are currently under consideration and will be clearly delineated in the final RFP.</p>
<p>RFI#19: Comment: Instructions to Offerors, page 23 of 24, paragraph 2, requiring a comment for "...each and every response..." appears extremely burdensome for evaluators to complete; recommend comments for evaluation responses that are B/E (Blue/Exceptional) as well as responses that are R/U (Red/Unsatisfactory).</p>
<p>Answer: Noted.</p>
<p>RFI#20: Comment: The Statement of Objectives included as part of the Draft RFP states in section 6.0 Place of Performance (Page 2 of 2) that the "Performance under contract will take place at contractor facilities." Question: Will the AF allow the contractor to conduct necessary requirements gathering at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, to ensure the best alignment of the demonstration's functionality with the needs of the end users and other interested parties?</p>
<p>Answer: Since current knowledge is not required, there will be no access to Air Force personnel or facilities during the competitive proposal process. AFGSC and AFNWC personnel (approximately 5-10) will attend the technology demonstrations. Between the date of award and the actual demonstrations, AFNWC will publish the rules of engagement for government information exchange during the demonstration.</p>
<p>RFI#21: Question: Paragraph 3.0 Objectives of the 09 Nov SOO states: "Contractor technology demonstrations shall provide a system that decreases data input time, increases data reliability, increases security, reduces transcription issues, improves reporting timeliness, and improves command and control while supporting the Air Force's nuclear enterprise". Would you please explain further what is meant by increasing data reliability?</p>
<p>Answer: Increasing data reliability refers to: ..."the accuracy and completeness of computer processed data, given to intended purposes for use. Computer-processed data include data (1) entered into a computer system and (2) resulting from computer processing. Computer-processed data can vary in form from electronic files to tables in published reports".</p>
<p>RFI#22: Question: Paragraph 3.1.3 of the 09 November 2010 SOO states: "Demonstrate which of the following capabilities your technology currently addresses:" Subparagraph 3.1.3.3 further states: "Ability to continuously download, store, upload, view, report and print data to a secure portal and data repository". Does the word "print data to" mean "print data from" (i.e., has a command to send to printer), or does it mean to otherwise send/transmit/publish?</p>
<p>Answer: Good point. Should be "print data from"...</p>

<DESC>NOTE: When notifying the program office of your intent to attend Industry Days, please e-mail both Richard Saltsman AND Adam Bernas. Please provide the program office with the names and titles of no more than 10 individuals who will be attending and include company name, citizenship, address, business size, and cage code (if applicable). <br />
<p><br />HH-60 PERSONNEL RECOVERY RECAPITALIZATION PROGRAM (HH-60 RECAP) / COMMON VERTICAL LIFT SUPPORT PLATFORM (CVLSP) INDUSTRY DAYS<br />SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)/CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI)</p>
<p>This CRFI is part of ongoing government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this CRFI. The government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition strategy. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent required. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The government reserves the right to not reply to information received.</p>
<p>The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition strategy. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to further engage industry in the effort through interactive Industry Days to gather additional information to support on-going market research, (2) to assist the Air Force in developing innovative low risk technical and business approaches to maximize compliance with approved operational requirements while achieving rapid operational fielding at affordable acquisition and ownership costs, and (3) to identify sources that can provide capability that satisfies the government's current requirement to deliver HH-60 Recap capability and CVLSP capability in either a combined package or as separate efforts. As described in the previous CRFIs, the Air Force is planning to acquire up to 112 new helicopter systems to recapitalize its aging HH-60G fleet and up to 93 new helicopter systems to replace the UH-1N fleet.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Reference previous announcements PIXS6396, originally posted 17 December 2009 and updated 13 December 2010, and PIXS6470, originally posted 23 March 2010 and updated 10 December 2010. The Air Force will conduct Industry Days to discuss the HH-60 Recap and CVLSP programs, as indicated in the 10 December 2010 posting to support the Air Force's on-going market research process. The Air Force seeks to gather information on innovative business approaches that provide the potential for efficiencies by leveraging common aspects between programs announced in the referenced previous market research SSS/CRFI releases. The Air Force also seeks to understand how these approaches are advantageous to the Government regarding the rapid fielding of systems capable of meeting minimum operational requirements at the lowest acquisition and ownership costs.</p>
<p>RESPONSE GUIDANCE:</p>
<p>Industry Days - For the one-on-one session provide an unclassified briefing no longer than 1 hour in length to address the PURPOSE and INTRODUCTION section listed above. There will not be a general session.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CRFI RESPONSE GUIDANCE:</p>
<p>(1) HH-60 Recap - If you did not respond to the original CRFI, you may do so now under separate cover (not part of the briefing). If you responded previously and have changes to your original submittal, italicize new information and strike through replaced information.</p>
<p>The USAF is interested in determining the level of capability, in accordance with the Recap CDD, that can be initially fielded as an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) production platform. This initial capability would be modified to a full CDD compliant platform after required design, development, testing, and analysis are completed. With this additional information, confirm the level of capability you can provide Off-The-Shelf (OTS) to meet this intent, to include the development schedule to meet the threshold values in accordance with the desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15, if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12.</p>
<p>(2) CVLSP - If you did not respond to the original CRFI, you may do so now under separate cover (not part of the briefing). If you responded previously and have changes to your original submittal, italicize new information and strike through replaced information.</p>
<p>The minimum CVLSP values provided in the original RFI PIXS6396 are now threshold values. With this additional information, confirm that you can provide an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) capability to meet these threshold values and achieve the desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15, if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12. In addition to demonstrating an understanding that the threshold values of all CVLSP requirements must be met, please provide the path by which your aircraft will achieve US DoD Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation and US Military or Civilian Air Worthiness Certification by IOC.</p>
<p>EVENT DETAILS:</p>
<p>Industry participation is limited to prime contractor teams with a maximum of 10 per contractor/team. Time will be set aside for meetings for each company to discuss its aircraft with Government representatives in one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>Notification is required NO LATER THAN 1400 EST, 30 December 2010, <strong>submitted by e-mail</strong> to Richard Saltsman at richard.saltsman@wpafb.af.mil <strong>AND</strong> Adam Bernas at adam.bernas@wpafb.af.mil. Please provide the program office with the names and titles of no more than 10 individuals who will be attending and include company name, citizenship, address, business size, and cage code (if applicable). Each company will be allotted up to 2 hours for a one-on-one session with the Government team (maximum of 1 hour allowed for company PURPOSE and INTRODUCTION briefing). Briefing times will be scheduled on a first come, first serve basis and will be assigned via e-mail. The government may provide additional information (general acquisition, testing, air worthiness, etc.) to assist in Q&amp;A during the one-on-one sessions. As the info is generated, it will be distributed electronically. Contractors who have specific questions they wish to discuss may submit them in advance to the contacts identified above.</p>
<p>Participation in this Industry Day is voluntary and in no way obligates the Government to award any contracts or pay any costs associated with such participation.</p>
<p>The meeting will take place in Dayton, Ohio on 12-14 January 2011 at the BAE Systems Facility located at 4032 Linden Avenue, Dayton, Ohio, 45431.</p>

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC>The US Forest Service, Chugach National Forest, intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures, to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to conduct aerial surveys of known wolverine habitat areas in the Turnagain Arm and Kenai Mountains for the purpose of collecting data to calculate the population size for the areas. This data will be used to compare wolverine abundance within and outside areas used for heli-skiing. This information will provide the Chugach National Forest with better tools to balance heli-skiing activities with wildlife habitat needs. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has the foremost responsibility and authority for the management of wildlife species in the State of Alaska. Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game has trained professionals to do this work efficiently and effectively. They are experienced in aerial survey methods for wolverine. This will result in a modification to an existing purchase order that was synopsized under solicitation number AG-0120-S-09-0010. Total estimated value of this modification is $32,000. No request for proposal is available for a competitive proposal, however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than 2 pm Alaska time, 4 January 2011. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 541990. The expected period of performance is approximately Jan 2011 - Dec 2014. Point of contact for this requirement is Denise Murphy, denisemurphy@fs.fed.us or 907-743-9531.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>
