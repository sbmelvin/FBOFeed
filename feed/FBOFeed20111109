<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-01</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>THIS WILL BE A TWO-STEP SOLICITATION:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Step</span>: WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> White Papers will be accepted on or before 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, 23 NOV 2011. Late white paper submissions will not be accepted after this due date. See Section IV for additional information.<br /><br />Only white papers are due at this time. Full proposals will be requested by the Government from those Offerors selected in the white paper evaluation process.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Step</span>: PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> Proposals will be accepted on or before 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, 23 DEC 2011 . This BAA will be closed at 4 PM Eastern Standard Time on 23 DEC 2011. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. </span></strong></p>
<p>NOTE: White Paper/Proposal receipt after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and white paper/proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late." Furthermore, note that if offerors utilize commercial carriers for delivery of white papers/proposals, they may not honor time-of-day delivery guarantees on military installations. Early white paper submission is encouraged.</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>1. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate, is soliciting white papers on the following research effort:</p>
<p>The area of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) exploitation and analysis for signals intelligence (SIGINT) possesses identified deficiencies with regards to cycle time and personnel requirements for the analysis of large data sets. As intelligence operators today are required to make critical decisions from analyzing large amounts of data acquired from multiple operational missions, semi-automated and automated technology capabilities are required to greatly enhance the analyst's abilities to identify any items of interest, and assist them with the prevalent data saturation issues they are currently experiencing.<br /><br />The aim of this BAA is to develop leading edge techniques and technologies that will provide near real-time and post-mission SIGINT analysis and exploitation capabilities. Technology areas under this announcement include, but are not limited to: effective and efficient data storage and dissemination capabilities; advanced data-mining techniques to process the vast amounts of data acquired from multiple missions; and automation or semi-automation of appropriate data analysis and exploitation techniques.</p>
<p>2. Data Rights Desired:</p>
<p>a. Technical Data: Unlimited Rights<br />b. Non-Commercial Software (NCS): Unlimited Rights<br />c. NCS Documentation: Unlimited Rights<br />d. Commercial Computer Software Rights: Customary License</p>
<p>e. The Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and NCS developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.</p>
<p>f. In exchange for paying for development of the data, the Government expects technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation developed entirely at Government expense to be delivered with Unlimited Rights.</p>
<p>g. Technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation developed with mixed funding are expected to be delivered with at least Government Purpose Rights. Offers that propose delivery of technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation subject to Government Purpose Rights should fully explain what technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation developed with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a Government contract will be incorporated, how the incorporation will benefit the program, and address whether those portions or processes are segregable. The Government expects that delivery of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation subject to Government Purpose Rights will fully meet program needs.</p>
<p>h. Offers that propose delivery of technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation subject to Limited Rights, Restricted Rights, or Specifically Negotiated License Rights will be considered. Proposals should fully explain what technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation developed with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a Government contract will be incorporated and how the incorporation will benefit the program.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are reminded that the Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data or Computer Software (the assertions list), required under DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014, is included in Section K and due at time of proposals. Assertions must be completed with specificity with regard to each item, component, or process listed. Nonconforming assertions lists will be rejected.</p>
<p>j. Note that DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software (commercial and noncommercial). Any commercial software to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Because many commercial software licenses are not transferrable or may not be acceptable to the Government, commercial software licenses proposed for delivery to the Government must be approved by the contracting officer prior to award.</p>
<p>k. As used in this subparagraph, the terms Unlimited Rights, Government Purpose Rights, Specifically Negotiated License Rights, and Limited Rights in technical data are as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013. The terms Unlimited Rights, Government Purpose Rights, Specifically Negotiated License Rights, and Restricted Rights in noncommercial computer software and noncommercial software documentation are as defined in DFARS 252.227-7014. The term Commercial Computer Software is as defined in DFARS 252.227-7014.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $7.9 million (M). The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 12 - $2.4M; FY 13 - $2.0M; FY 14 - $1.8M; and FY 15 - $1.7M.

<p>4. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGC will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission, or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers, should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>5. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105.

Electronic submission is NOT authorized. Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC listed in Section VII.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted, and whether one or more sources will be selected for award.</p>
<p>(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The approach for the development and/or enhancement of semi- or automated SIGINT exploitation and analysis software tools. White papers/proposals should document the potential quantifiable benefits in terms of increased efficiency of semi- or automated data analysis and exploitation, and the increase in the associated capability;</p>
<p>(2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge;</p>
<p>(3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness;</p>
<p>(4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>a. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>(2) Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>(3) Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p>b. Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGC will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS/SCI) information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<a href="mailto:robert.waible@us.army.mil">ACC-RSA-AATD - (SPS)</a>
<DESC>Request for Information:  This request for information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under FAR, Part 10, and is not a request for proposals.  The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) seeks information on mission systems for a Joint Multi-Role (JMR) vertical lift aircraft that would enter service in the 2030 timeframe with a service life of 50 years.  Mission Systems are those systems that enable the aircraft to perform militarily relevant functions beyond lift and presence.  Relevant missions include cargo, utility, armed scout, attack, humanitarian assistance, medevac, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), land/sea search and rescue, special warfare support, vertical replenishment, airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM), and others. Respondents are urged to study the supplemental information available at http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/RFI_Supplemental_Info.pdf . <br>    <br>The AMRDEC has begun a focused research program called JMR Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) that will support development of a specification for an anticipated JMR Program of Record.  The JMR TD is planned to go through FY20 and consists of two Phases:  Phase 1 focuses on the Air Vehicle while Phase 2 focuses on Mission Systems.  This RFI seeks to inform the Government of promising mission system technologies that could be available for application (TRL 6/7) in the FY20 timeframe that would provide the desired capabilities in a future vertical lift aircraft.<br>  <br>Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, advanced survivability equipment; optimum mix of active and passive survivability features; weapons (lethal and nonlethal) including directed energy (DE), sensors (pilotage; targeting; maritime search, track, and identification of surface and subsurface targets; and situational awareness); various avionics architectural approaches (all of which must be Joint Common Architecture (JCA) conformant); communication equipment (including, for example, low drag and multi-function antennas, multi-band radios, non-traditional communications, etc.); data buses (copper, fiber optic, wireless, etc.); electrical power and thermal load management (including DE weapon consideration); information assurance; mission systems design for future growth, upgradability, and mission flexibility; cockpit layout and human-machine interaction; human interface devices (visual displays, helmet-mounted displays, visor projection, 3D aural displays, tactile, buttons, switches, grips, etc.); pilot aiding systems / autonomy (cognitive decision aiding, intelligent agents, associate technology, etc.); passenger aiding (en route mission rehearsal, situation awareness, communications, battery charging, etc.); optionally piloted vehicle; and manned / unmanned teaming.  Non-traditional technologies and innovative concepts are of interest.<br>  <br>Mission systems for future aircraft such as a JMR must function as an integrated whole and allow rapid reconfiguration in the field.  They must also be affordable in acquisition, operation, and sustainment, as well as in upgrade / technology refresh throughout the entire life cycle of the air vehicle.<br><br>This RFI also seeks feedback on the current plan for Phase 2 of JMR TD. Results from the RFI will particularly influence a Mission Systems Effectiveness Trades and Analysis (MS ETA) activity.  It is anticipated that a BAA for MS ETA will be issued in mid-January 2012, at which time all communication with this office related to JMR TD-except for negotiations and on-going contracts-must cease until after awards are made.<br><br>This is a market research announcement for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to pay for any information, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI. All submissions will be treated as information only. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any review of this RFI; however, clarification of submissions may be requested by the Contracting Officer. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary.  <br><br>Responses to this RFI are requested by close of business 15 December 2011and are not to exceed 25 pages in length including all appendices.  Unclassified responses should be submitted electronically via the AMRDEC Safe Access and File Exchange website (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/) in Microsoft Office format or as a portable document format (".pdf") file.  Use the following email address as prompted by the site: robert.waible@conus.army.mil.  If proprietary or copyrighted information is submitted, please include a statement authorizing the Government to copy and use it within the Government for evaluation purposes.  Appropriately marked proprietary information will be properly protected by the U.S. Government.  Classified information should be submitted only if it significantly clarifies or broadens the scope of technology considered.  If a classified response is necessary, please write the contracting point of contact for specific submittal instructions, and include company name and address, primary and one alternate point of contact, telephone and email address, cage code, and NAICS code.  AMRDEC's SAFE site is not approved for transmission of classified information.

The MH-60R is configured for Ku-Band data link capability; however, fleet-wide incorporation of Ku-Band functionality is not complete. Therefore, the MH-60R requires C-Band reversibility capability. Sikorsky Aircraft has provided provisions for C-Band reversibility through ECP 4310 and the following activities:
<p>&bull; Updated the two exiting 71600-21010-041 RFA Blanker Plates to 71600-21010-043 configuration for C-Band reversibility for production aircraft 166527 and subsequent.<br />&bull; Updated the RFA Blanker Plate installations in the Nose Shelf (71600-21002-013) and the aft transition shear deck (71600-23008-012) to install the new 71600-21010-043 FRA Blanker Plates.<br />&bull; Updated the 71450-22050-012 Loose Equipment Kit to add two 242132 Adapters for C-Band reversibility capability at the RF antenna locations for production aircraft 166515 to 166526.<br />&bull; Updated the 71450-22050-012 Loose Equipment Kit to replace the existing RFN-7650 Adapter at Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) location with a new M55339/7-00029 Adapter.</p>
<p>Revision 1 to ECP 4310 will retrofit MH-60R aircraft 166515 to 166526 to a production configuration.</p>
<p>This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements. SAC is the only known source with the knowledge, experience, expertise, and proprietary technical data required to successfully perform these tasks.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Household Component <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>Background<br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 "to enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care services and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions and in the organization, financing and delivery of health care services)." In 1999, Congress, in its reauthorization language, stated that the Director of the AHRQ "shall conduct and support research and build private-public partnerships to (1) identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery; (2) develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and (3) disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry." <br />The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component (HC), Medical Provider Component (MPC), and Insurance Component (IC), which began in 1996, is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals (MEPS-HC), their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.) (MEPS-MPC), and employers across the United States (MEPS-IC). MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers. For further discussion of the MEPS family of surveys as well as historical context please see: http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp<br />During the household interviews, MEPS-HC collects the following detailed information for each person in the household: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. Data collection consists of contacting upwards of 14,500 households (representing 35,000 individuals) five times over a two and a half-year period for face-to-face interviews. The interviewer workforce would consist of approximately 500 interviewers employed throughout the United States (approximately 180 primary sampling units representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia). The survey itself is conducted through the use of a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI). Contact of households is a multi step process (combined phone, mail effort) designed to maximize cooperation rates with regards to scheduling in person interviews. Programming the CAPI instrument consists of converting approximately 50 different questionnaire sections representing over 1,000 pages of hardcopy material into a Windows based medium. In addition, annually, approximately 120 interviewers are to be recruited, hired and trained over a one week period to address attrition of current hires. Training takes place at a central location. After the initial in person training in home training materials are developed and distributed to interviewers reflecting continuing data collection efforts over a two and half year period. Appropriate security measures must be demonstrated with regards to maintaining the confidential protection of data collected. This consists of, but not limited to, the encryption of interviewer laptops, the electronic transfer of data through encrypted means to a central location for data processing and the preparation of data for public release. Approximately 20 public use files are released annually representing thousands of analytical variables pertaining health care utilization and expenditures as well as demographic characteristics of the sample population. <br />The contractor shall perform the following types of services under this contract:<br />* Survey/project management</p>
<p>* Continue operation of MEPS-HC<br />* Preparation of MEPS-HC documentation<br />* Liaison with MEPS-HC principals<br />* Cooperation and liaison with MPC contractor assuring timely file transfers for editing/imputation work<br />* Cooperation with AHRQ to obtain clearances<br />* Meeting arrangements<br />* Project closeout/transfer of operations<br />* Reporting, work planning, management meetings</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Directorate (LRK), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA intends to modify the existing SLRS contract with ITT, Corporation, and Systems Division, 1030 South Highway A1A, Bldg 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925 to extend the period of performance to allow for continued sustainment of the Eastern and Western Ranges until the follow-on contract is awarded. SLRS contract provides the sustainment and Instrumentation Modernization (IM) upgrades to the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR) communications, telemetry, and command and control systems located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air force Base respectively.<br />Allowing continued sustainment under the SLRS contract until Launch Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated support contract (LISC) is awarded will prevent unacceptable delays in critical range National priority space launches. The follow-on contract (LISC) is anticipated to provide range operation services, maintenance and upgrade of both ER and WR. Currently, the LISC acquisition strategy is in development with an anticipated award date of early FY13. However, until the follow-on contract is awarded, SLRSC must sustain the ranges. The contract modification will include several short-term sustainment option CLINS to allow for extension of the SLRS contract until the award of the follow-on contract.<br /><br />This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as Implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties including small and small disadvantaged businesses may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties must show capability to fulfill Government's immediate, short-term need for the effort described above. The notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this effort is 541712 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. Capabilities information may be email to Ms Van B. Choat, Contracting Officer, at Van.Choat@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

INTRODUCTION <br><br>Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), a U.S. Army garrison, located in South Central Missouri is requesting, via this Request for Interest (RFI), responses from suppliers of electricity interested in submitting a proposal for full requirements power supply to FLW.  <br><br>The purpose of the RFI is to solicit information from qualified electrical suppliers to ascertain availability of capacity and interest in supplying FLW's electrical needs.  <br><br>Please note that an expression of interest in providing this energy product is neither binding nor promissory.  Responses will be used for planning purposes in determining available resources for firming Fort Leonard Wood's electrical needs.  Additionally, failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude the ability to respond to any future Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the purchase of energy products if issued at a later date.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP at a later date.  This RFI does not commit FLW to contract for any supply or service, nor is FLW seeking contract proposals at this time.  Responders are advised that FLW will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI and that all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested responder's expense.<br> <br>In light of the amount of time required for respondents to provide such information and for FLW to evaluate it, a decision as to whether to proceed with an RFP cannot be expected prior to January 2012.  <br>2. DESCRIPTION OF REQUEST: <br><br>FLW is issuing this RFI in an effort to solicit interest in the provision of wholesale, firm full-requirements energy supply, and corresponding capacity and ancillary services.  The requested power will be delivered to an interconnection or interface on the Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI) system border.  AECI is a consumer-owned rural electric generation and transmission cooperative that provides transmission service over facilities located in the States of Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma.  A copy of the Transmission Service Agreement between AECI and FLW is attached as Attachment 1.  AECI will provide transmission service from the AECI border to Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative (Sho-Me).  Sho-Me will deliver the electric power from its interface with AECI to FLW.  FLW has a transmission service agreement with Sho-Me for the delivery of power.<br><br>AECI will provide to FLW, through their Open Access Transmission Tariff, two ancillary services (Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service and Reactive Supply, and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service).  Suppliers responding to this RFI must document how they intend to provide the other ancillary services (Regulation and Frequency Response Service, Energy Imbalance Service, Operating Reserve-Spinning Service, Operation Reserve-Supplemental Service, and Generator Imbalance Service).  Responders must have the capability, and should identify how they intend to forecast and schedule FLW's load, whether dynamically or in hourly blocks, and provide associated ancillary services. All projected costs for providing these services must be broken out and included in your response.  <br><br>Supply will begin January 1, 2013.  However, for planning purposes it is necessary to have an agreement in place no later than June 30, 2012. FLW is targeting a contract term between 1 and 5 years in length.  Over the most recent 12-months, FLW had a peak demand of 55 MW and consumed approximately 244,000 MWh.  Attachment 2 shows the monthly demands (kW), energy consumption (kWh) and load factors for the 12 month period ending September 30, 2011.  The expected demand in 2013 is 65 MW with a 5% annual load growth for each year through 2017.<br><br>FLW, as a U.S. government entity, is subject to certain policy mandates governing its purchase and use of electricity, specifically renewable energy.  Therefore, respondents to this RFI should identify how they intend to assist FLW in meeting the target of sourcing at least 7.5% of its annual electricity needs from renewable resources, per the Federal Energy Policy Act-2005. <br>3.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:<br><br>As indicated above, AECI and Sho-Me Power will provide transmission service from the AECI border to FLW.  AECI and Sho-Me will bill FLW for said transmission service. Thus these services should not be included as part of your submission.  <br>  <br>Alternative proposals to meet the installations energy requirements are welcomed. However, any alternative proposals must fully explain the rationale and include a cause & effect (pros/cons) statement associated with applying the alternative.  <br><br><br>4.  RFI SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: <br><br>In addition to being able to successfully provide the above-mentioned power supply attributes, all responses to this RFI must meet the following requirements to be considered:<br><br>1.	Please provide a description of your company, specifically identifying the legal entity that would be contracting under a potential agreement.<br><br>2.	Please indicate the long-term debt rating (S&P, Moody and/or Fitch) of the legal entity that would be acting as the contracting party in this transaction.  If such information is not available, please provide other financial information, including D&B number or audited financials, which would be sufficient to evaluate the financial standing of the contracting party.<br><br>3.	Please include a description of the types of products that will be offered to meet FLW's energy requirements, such as on-peak/off-peak energy blocks, index pricing and fixed pricing.  Also, provide a description of the flexibility that will be available under the pricing options, such as required notice for purchasing blocks, sell back of excess block energy purchased and the index that will be used for pricing for market purchases. <br><br>4.	Please provide sample contracts for all product types offered, specifying standard terms and conditions.<br><br>5.	Please include contact name, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address for communications regarding this RFI.<br><br>6.	Please provide indicative pricing for each term and product offered, including the effect on pricing of meeting FLW's renewable energy goals.  As discussed above pricing for terms from one to five years is desireable.<br><br><br>5.  PROCESS AND TIMING: <br><br>1. Timing: Interest packages submitted in response to this RFI must be received by FLW on or before December 9, 2011.   <br><br>2.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only. No formal solicitation document exists at this time. The Walla Walla Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), 77 Wainwright, Walla Walla, WA 99362 is seeking potential sources to provide information regarding the installation of two ceiling mounted equipment support multiple arm boom assemblies.  These devices are to be located into our new endoscopic rooms (two) that will be located on the second floor of a new outpatient building which is currently under construction.  

The desire is to provide support assemblies in each room. Each assembly must allow the following equipment, medical and computer, to be suspended from the ceiling. The following is a description of what will be desired for each room.

Minor Boom Assembly:
In addition to the main support assembly, a second minor smaller boom assembly(s) with two arms is also required.  The arms are to be capable of mounting single and upgradeable to dual LCD 20" monitors and will provide the necessary power and cabling paths to support video monitor feeds from the equipment listed on the main boom assemblies and be adjustable in both rotation and vertical movements.  In addition if an exam light cannot be mounted to the main support booms it can be mounted to this assembly.   

All booms must have sufficient cabling capabilities to allow for VGA style cables to be strung between the major boom assembly and the minor boom assembly. 

The VA is seeking potential sources to provide information/options for these support assemblies. The NAICS code for this procurement is not clearly defined but could fall under the following categories: 423490, 339113 or 339112. Standard size dollars will be appropriate to NAICS code selected.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis RFI/Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to negotiate sole-source procurement with American Bankers Association for training if no alternate sources are identified from this combined Synopsis RFI/Intent to Sole Source. The ABA is holding its national compliance school in San Diego early next year (the week of March 30). This course provides training for senior safety and soundness examiners, who will learn the following:
Anatomy of a Regulation (so bank examiners can research regulations more efficiently)
BSA/USA Patriot Act (background, purpose, coverage and enforcement of the Bank Secrecy)
CRA Compliance - Large  and Small Banks
Credit Card Compliance
E-Compliance
Elements of a Compliance Program
Fair Credit Reporting Act 
FDIC Insurance Rules
Flood (National Flood Insurance Regulations which apply to real estate lending)
Home Mortgage disclosure Act (HMDA (Regulation C). 
Foreign Assets Control laws and the types of compliance programs 
Federal Financial Privacy Law and related provisions of other federal and state laws
ECOA Regulation B and Fair Housing Act (FHA)
Regulation CC (Expedited Funds Availability Act.)
Truth in Savings Act Regulation DD
Regulations D and Q
Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E 
Regulation O
Regulation Z
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA 
UDAAP (regulatory advisories and directives to financial institutions regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices)  
The course meets CFPB's training timelines and the location of the training (San Diego) reduces travel expenses. It is the Governments intent to award a 5 year BPA for The Premier Education in Compliance course.  

Vendors who offer similar training courses are encouraged to respond to this Combined Synopsis RFI/Intent to Sole Source and provide the following information:
Vendor contact information
Name of course
Course curriculum
Dates of training during the next 6 months
Location of training

<DESC>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is tasked with identifying, arresting, and removing aliens who present a danger to national security or a risk to public safety through efficient enforcement and removal operations. This includes providing adequate and appropriate custody management to support removals, facilitate the processing of illegal aliens through the immigration courts, and enforcing their departure from the United States. As a result, ICE has a requirement to replace the current Service Processing Center (SPC) located in the El Paso Area of Responsibility (AOR).
<p>ICE is conducting market research in accordance with FAR 10.002 procedures in order to determine a suitable location for the required detention services. ICE is surveying several of the counties in the El Paso AOR as well as private industry to determine whom may be interested in partnering with ICE to support the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) mission. In order to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, ICE needs the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Description of proposed facility, to include brief history, age, style of construction, layout and dimensions of interior spaces, security levels, number of detention beds, size of grounds/campus.</p>
<p>&bull; Geographic location and census data (population, education level, community size designation-urban, suburban, rural, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Projected date of facility's availability.</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed staffing of facility (e.g., number, name of positions, whether county employees or contract employees). If contract staff, identify proposed vendor.</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed partners, if any.</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to local health care services, to include hospitals, emergency rooms, surgery, medical, and mental-health services.</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to local consulates, pro-bono legal services, non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to airport(s) and description of various transportation routes (public and private).</p>
<p>&bull; Brief description of facilities-related modifications that may be required to serve ICE's proposed population (ICE utilizes the 2008 Performance Based National Detention Standards).</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of on-site medical care.</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of Service Provider transportation.</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of indoor and outdoor recreation space.</p>
<p>&bull; Pictures of exterior grounds/campus, building structure(s), facility interior spaces (if available).</p>
<p>&bull; Ball-park per diem range.</p>
<p>If interested in participating in this effort, please provide the following information in response to this Sources Sought notice no later than 5pm on November 18, 2011.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Design Build Construction Services for RM 09-1877, Repairs to Pier 4, NAVSUPPACT Mechanicsburg PA (Detachment Philadelphia Annex), Philadelphia Naval Business Center (PNBC) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

Description of the Existing Facility; 

Pier 4 is a 1150-ft long by 100-ft wide pile supported structure.  The pile substructure consists of 100 timber pile support bents and 17 steel pile support bents.  Currently the Pier serves as a maintenance berth for two aircraft carriers the Ex-USS John F.
 Kennedy and the Ex-USS Forrestal.  The Forrestal is expected to be replaced by her sister ship the Saratoga in the near future.  Each timber pile bent contains 32 vertical timber piles, with spacing varying between 2ft 8in below the crane rails and 3ft 6in near the east and west pier edges.  Intermediate vertical timber piles are located below the interior crane rails.  Intermediate timber batter piles are located near the east and west pier edges.  Spanning between the timber piles are 8-in by 12-in timber pile caps that support reinforced concrete cap walls.  A reinforced concrete deck spans between and is supported by the cap walls.  A reinforced concrete utility trench is located along the western pier edge, integrated into the deck and covered with concrete and steel closure panels.
  Between bents 56 and 66, the pier is founded on a massive, earth filled concrete sheet pile abandoned crane foundation that extend from the mud line to approximately mean high water elevation. 

The fender system typically consists of nominally 12-in-diameter timber piles clustered in groups of three and aligned with the pile bents.  Spanning between the fender piles and connected to the pier face are upper and lower 12-in by 12-in timber wales.  Timber chocks are attached to the outboard face of the wales between each fender pile cluster.  Timber spacer blocks, spaced at approximately 5ft on-center, provide a gap between the fender system and the pier face.  In the vicinity of the floating barges used for vessel stand-off, the fender piles are concrete-filled, 16-in-diameter steel pipe piles.
   Currently the only active utilities on the pier consist of electrical and general lighting.  All other utilities have been abandoned.   

The contract will provide:

 Proposed Facility  
 
The project shall remove sections of the existing pier 4 along the centerline wide enough for a proposed crane path and continue the approximately 1000 feet length of the Pier centerline area of supporting piers, timber decking and pier caps. Also there is a requirement to replace decking and piles to support the use of the aircraft elevators and provide mooring points for the two aircraft carriers currently berthed at the pier. Reinforced concrete fender piles will also be added at the mooring points to support the in place berthing of the two CVs.
 Demolition shall consist of removing portions of the existing pier, pile caps, timber piles and timber fender system. The outboard end of the Pier is approximately 115 feet long and constructed of a reinforced concrete deck and steel H-piles. These steel H-pile have extensive corrosion from long term exposure to the marine environment. These steel H-piles shall be repaired to include individual partial length encasement with reinforced concrete. The encasements shall extend from below the concrete deck to approximately 2 feet below Mean Low Water (MLW). A pile supported Pier shall be built to replace a significant portion of the pier. The replacement section of the pier shall be pile supported with concrete pile caps and concrete decking.
 It shall be constructed according to standard civil engineering practices with various sized rebar framing. The final structure shall be built flush (match) with the existing deck structure. The perimeter joint shall be dowelled to connect between the new structure and the existing Pier No.#4. All design criteria efforts shall follow ACI, AISC and AF&PA Code to complete a safe and efficient structure. Mooring hardware shall replace all damaged and missing items as to improve the docking efficiencies and capabilities. Bollard and cleats to be replaced shall have the maximum load carrying capabilities allowed by this repair modification. The remaining hardware needs to be recoated and repair the grout base.
 

The magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.

<a href="mailto:stephen.ciliberto@navy.mil">NAVY POC: STEPHEN CILIBERTO</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   Business sources are currently being sought for providing professional, administrative, and technical services in support of CNIC N9s Automated Housing Referral Network (AHRN).  

Background:
The Automated Housing Referral Network (AHRN) program started in 2001, and was originally sponsored and funded by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations & Environment) as a means to improve the housing referral process for both installation Military Housing Offices (MHO) and military members and their families.  This Internet-based housing referral system offers free access to military members and provides data on available rental housing in the communities near military installations.
  Currently, the Military Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard) fund the maintenance of AHRN.  The MHO at the military installation administers AHRN, the Department of the Navy performs the program and contract management of AHRN and DoD retains program oversight.

Since its initial implementation in June 2004, AHRN has continued to expand and is currently supported at 481 installations (442 CONUS and 39 OCONUS) representing all military services.  As of August 2011, over 881,000 individuals have registered in AHRN, including 733,000 military members and 148,000 property managers/landlords.  Additionally, there were 580,711 properties listed in the AHRN system, with 42,666 of these currently available.
  These listings consist of community rentals, on-base/privatized housing, government-owned/managed housing, temporary lodging, military shared, and military for-sale-by owner (FSBO).  On average, 12,186 new listings are added to AHRN each month.

Scope and Contractor Responsibilities:
The Government requires continuing support associated with the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) system.  The intent of coordinating efforts of the housing referral process with the BAH system is to provide more timely and accurate information regarding housing availability and pricing, therefore producing a better housing allowance.  The Government also requires continuing support associated with the AHRN data exchange with the electronic Military Housing (eMH), the housing database of record for Navy, USMC, and Army.

-Contractor shall oversee the continued operation of the network, including such tasks and capabilities as: backups, maintenance, updates, security, uninterrupted power supply, 24/7 uptime, high-speed data lines, and fault tolerance.

AHRN TrainingThe Contractor shall train the MHO and participating property managers in the use, operation, and maintenance of the AHRN.
  

-The Contractor shall provide finalized training material to the MHO personnel, and participating property managers.

-The Contractor, in consultation with MHOs, shall engage private sector property managers such as military privatized housing partners to provide updates for their communities.

-The Contractor shall attend the Professional Housing Management Association (PHMA) Professional Development Series (PDS) in San Diego in January 2012 to provide AHRN training to attendees.

-The Contractor shall attend both the National Apartment Association (NAA) and National Association of Residential Property Managers (NARPM) conference/trade show to heighten awareness of AHRN with private property managers and landlords.
  Locations are to be determined. 

-The Contractor shall provide 4 AHRN training sessions to be provided concurrently with BAH training.  Locations are to be determined. 

-The Contractor shall provide up to 10 additional training sessions upon request by CNIC Housing, and shall provide on-demand webinar training.  Anticipated requirements are for 7 CONUS and 3 OCONUS sessions.

Program ManagementThe contractor shall provide a Management Plan and a Technical Plan.  Once approved, the contractor will deploy, improve and maintain the AHRN system at all CONUS MHAs and deployed OCONUS OHAs.  CNIC and the participating Military Services will select and determine the deployment priority of the remaining MHAs and OHAs.
  

-The Contractor shall plan and attend a kick-off meeting for this contract with the AHRN Drive Team members in the Washington, DC metro area. 

-The Contractor shall plan and attend quarterly AHRN Drive Team meetings with all of the military services AHRN points of contact to prioritize and provide status on improvements to AHRN.  The meeting shall be held in the Washington, DC metro area. A priority list of improvements shall be updated and provided quarterly.

-The Contractor shall conduct a detailed survey of AHRN customer satisfaction for the first 10 months of the period of performance.  This survey shall request quantitative feedback from the following groups: MHOs, military members, and property managers.
  Quantitative feedback shall be obtained on the following topics at a minimum: overall satisfaction, training (MHOs only), marketing materials (MHOs only), customer support, and overall experience and value.

Future DeploymentsThe Contractor shall deploy AHRN to other OCONUS locations.  Locations are to be determined.  This deployment is expected to consist of one 19 day/18 night trip, on-site AHRN training at each housing office (5 total), and zero property manager training sessions.  The Contractor shall also provide ongoing support to these locations after deployment as above.  

The anticipated award will be a cost reimbursement type contract with a base year and two (2) one-year option periods.
  The base period is expected to begin on or around 1 January 2012.  The Government estimates between 5 and 10 deployments of AHRN in each contract year.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
Analytical Microbiology Laboratory Services Supporting the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Program
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NOCONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center requires contractor support to provide laboratory services contracts under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR) implementation program.  
EPA is responsible for investigating chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrence in an effort to characterize drinking water.  EPA relies on independent research efforts (e.g., United States Geological Survey [USGS] studies) and is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest occurrence study is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  UCMR is a 5-year cyclic monitoring program that allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water.  Every five years, the UCMR is redefined through regulatory proposal and promulgation.  Monitoring results collected under the UCMR are correlated with population data to obtain an exposure assessment for each contaminant.  If warranted, exposure information from the UCMR is then combined with health effects and water treatment control information to determine a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for a contaminant as a National Primary Drinking Water Standard (NP DWS).  This sound science strategy provides the basis for maximizing public health protection. 
The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small businesses with thecapability to perform all or a portion of the requirements defined in the attached draftPerformance Work Statement (PWS) and to further determine whether or not all or aportion of the work can be set-aside for potential small businesses sources. The NorthAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380 Testing Laboratories with a size standard of $12 Million. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in performing physical, chemical, and other analytical testing services, such as acoustics or vibration testing, assaying, biological testing (except medical and veterinary), calibration testing, electrical and electronic testing, geotechnical testing, mechanical testing, nondestructive testing, or thermal testing. The testing may occur in a laboratory or on-site.
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages, and no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party's demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience, and past performance in each of the areas included in the draft PWS.  Interested parties should describe their ability to provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the efforts required by the PWS.  The proposed contract will have a five year ordering period.  It is anticipated that a multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with firm fixed price task orders will result from the subsequent solicitation.
Interested parties are requested to address the following questions:1.	Have you participated in surveys or embarked in a research project that involved virus detection from water samples?2.	Have you performed qPCR analysis for viruses or other pathogens?  Please include a list of publications, reports of surveys, and/or research results.3.	How many analysts do you expect to participate in the analysis, in order to assure implementation of high quantity of samples?4.	Are you capable of performing analysis for total coliforms/E.coli, bacteriophage, aerobic spores and enterococci indicators?5.	Given that the holding time for the analysis of these microbes is in the range of 30-72 hrs, sub-contracting may not be feasible.  Do you intend to analyze the indicators and the viruses at one facility?6.	How many samples can you analyze by method 1615, per week?  In your response please take into consideration that you will have to analyze additional four indicators.,namely total coliforms: E. coli, Enterococci, Bacteriophage, and Aerobic spores7.	Do you have separate dedicated rooms/ hoods for the different aspects of sample preparation, qPCR preparation, performing actual qPCR, tissue culture facilities,   as  specified in EPA manual 815-B-04-001- and Method 1615?8.	Will your lab be able to perform both qPCR and tissue culture? Are your analysts trained in these techniques? 9.	Do you have and maintain in-house tissue culture facilities?10.	Is your laboratory drinking water certified (NELAC; EPA certified) or if not currently certified was it ever in the past?  Do you have any other kind of certification?   Have one or more of your analysts been a member of a certified lab?11.	Were you an ICR approved laboratory?12.	Will you be ready to participate in a proficiency test that will be organized by EPA as part of the solicitation process early next calendar year?
Interested parties should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code,(i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned,small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. 
EPA reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner EPA determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response. However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary. EPA will review said information and safeguard it accordingly.  The Government will not pay for any information that is provided in response to this announcement, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
Responses to the above should be submitted to Erin Ridder via email, ridder.erin@epa.gov, with a courtesy copy to Noelle Mills, mills.noelle@epa.gov, no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting.

<SUBJECT>ITER Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angel Viewing System Manufacturability Study and Cost Estimate
<SOLNBR>RFP-12-010-R

<CONTACT>Kevin D. Ranahan, Subcontract Administrator, Phone 609-243-2011, Fax 609-243-2021, Email kranahan@pppl.gov
<DESC>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a project underway in Cadarache, France to construct a device that will demonstrate nuclear fusion power at a power plant-relevant scale. Work scope associated with the ITER Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angle Viewing System is assigned to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a national laboratory operated by Princeton University for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC02-09CH11466. PPPL is responsible for the work described in a Statement of Work (SOW) that will be published as part of Request for Proposal (RFP) 12-010-R. The Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angle Viewing System provides real-time, simultaneous visible and IR images of the ITER divertor region via endoscopes and relay optics located in five upper port plugs mounted on the ITER vacuum vessel. This system must function reliably with limited maintenance for many years in a high vacuum, high nuclear radiation, and high magnetic field environment and remain robust through repeated thermal cycling. The endoscopes and relay optics are 9.7 meters long, approximately half of which is subject to the high vacuum and high nuclear radiation environment. The RFP SOW will cover engineering support services consisting of: 1) providing an assessment of and design improvements related to the manufacturability of the Upper Port Visible/Infrared Camera System; and 2) providing a cost estimate for completion of the design, manufacturing of components, system assembly, and system optical alignment. The design of this system is currently at the conceptual design level. This work shall be performed by an Engineering Support Subcontractor (ESS). The ESS shall evaluate the current optical design from the point of view of manufacturability (packaging and tolerances of components, assembly, and alignment), identify design improvements that will facilitate cost efficient manufacturability, and produce a preliminary manufacturing plan. The ESS shall also provide a cost estimate for completing the design of the system (preliminary and final design phases), fabricating the system, and system alignment. The cost estimate shall be done in an Excel spreadsheet template provided by PPPL. Inputs to this work to be provided by PPPL are: 1) existing documentation on the system; 2) the current optical design; 3) CAD (step) files of the current conceptual-level mechanical design; and 4) the cost estimate template. Deliverables will be: 1) the manufacturing plan; 2) CAD and optical design software files incorporating any design changes; and 3) the cost estimate. The deliverables should not contain proprietary information and should be suitable for public dissemination. PPPL plans to use the results of the ESS effort to validate the conceptual design and support preparations for a future solicitation (currently planned for 2012) to complete the design, fabricate, assemble, and align the Upper Port Visible/Infrared Wide Angle Viewing System. It is the intent of PPPL to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for performance of the ESS work scope described in the SOW, and to award a subcontract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to PPPL. The subcontract period of performance shall have a duration of approximately three months (currently planned for March-May 2012). This announcement is not a solicitation and does not obligate PPPL to issue a solicitation. Interested parties who believe that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a statement demonstrating their capabilities to perform this work. Information submitted must describe the party's organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network, and relevant past experience. Include company name, address, telephone number and email addresses for technical and administrative points of contact, and brochure/literature. Please send your documentation to Mr. Kevin Ranahan, Subcontract Administrator at the office identified above, by fax to (609) 243-2021 or by email to kranahan@pppl.gov. Electronic submittals are preferred. To be considered by PPPL documentation should be received within ten (10) working days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Please be advised that PPPL will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.<br /><br />Expressions of Interest from Foreign Firms will be considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. No Solicitation is currently available. The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Contracting Office 19,Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center will be issuing a solicitation to award a construction contract to a General Contractor for Project 666-11-101, Replace Boiler Plant project at the Sheridan VAMC, 1898 Fort Road, Sheridan, WY 82801. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on/about March 31, 2012. The work includes general construction, structural steel, mechanical and electrical work, utility systems, underground storage tanks, generator and necessary removal of existing structures. The coal-fired boiler plant being replaced has a capacity of greater than 21,000 pounds per hour. At this point in the procurement process, the Department of Veterans Affairs is performing market research to determine contractor socio-economic category under all Small Business socio economic categories, e.g. Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small Business and Small Business, bonding capacity, and experience in installing coal-fired boilers.  Due to the complex nature of the project, relevant coal-fired boiler plant experience (e.g. experience installing coal-fired boilers of similar or larger sizes, or of replacing coal-fired boilers with newer coal-fired boilers of a similar size as the current system, but not experience installing gas boilers or replacing coal-fired boilers with gas boilers) is a critical experiential component of the project. A lack of experience in the specific field of installing coal-fired boilers will result in a contractor being disqualified from consideration as a prime contractor for socioeconomic category determination of this solicitation.  Interested firms should send, by e-mail only, the following information: Socio-Economic Category; DUNS number; Maximum bonding capability for a single bid; total maximum bonding capacity; and any relevant coal-fired boiler plant experience as detailed above. Information shall be sent to daniel.pagone@va.gov by close of business November 30, 2011. Estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Information received will be used in any set aside determination. The NAICS code for this procurement will be 238220.

<DESC>Synopsis<br />The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Associate Director for Acquisition, Technology and Facilities (ADNI/AT&amp;F) is interested in innovative approaches to reducing costs in satellite acquisition. In response to this "Meyerriecks Challenge", the ODNI requests feedback and critique from the space industry to refine preliminary concepts. Alternative acquisition approaches which may be more cost effective will be considered. These comments, approaches, and concepts will be reviewed and compiled into a refined acquisition concept for industry preview in January 2012.
<p><br />Background<br />Over the years, many publications have described the degenerative state of affairs in space acquisition and have suggested ways to change the industry and the government. Some ideas have been implemented while others are under consideration, but there remains more to do. These proposed solutions run the gamut of changing organizations, processes, skill set development, manufacturing techniques, contracting approaches, and policy. The ODNI is particularly interested in exploring an industry wide approach using scalable spacecraft data and power architectures built on open standards with selected common components. This approach is analogous to the personal computer development model where industry wide standards for defined interfaces and protocols played a vital role in the PC's exponential performance improvement during a time of significant cost reduction. While it is true that individual companies have experienced moderate success with their own standards and common components, it is postulated that executing a cost effective satellite acquisition concept with open standards industry wide would reduce costs while increasing quality, and eventually, performance. The objective is to save 20% to 40% on the nation's entire satellite investment over a decade. ODNI is developing a satellite market model (Diagram 1) to analyze the effect of potential measures on community costs, This approach would not be successful without a compelling business case and full support and engagement of both government and space industry stakeholders. Diagram 2 illustrates that, because of the overall volume, it is imperative we engage the entire US market.</p>
<p>Scope<br />This RFI applies primarily to bus and payloads of all types of satellites, whether commercial or government sponsored. In order to make the business case close, the ODNI would like to explore concepts of affordability that can apply as widely as possible to all satellites. It is recognized that not all subsystems are appropriate for common components or full integration using standardized electrical or data architectures. However, we believe that with appropriate changes to government acquisition methods, we can achieve significant cost savings. Considerations may include reductions to non-recurring engineering efforts, simplification of system integration, improvements to mass and power efficiency, reduction to initial investments, and improved return on investments. This RFI does not address launch or ground systems; otherwise, we do not want to restrict industry ideas for more cost effective approaches. Our initial concept is being developed in an Innovative Space Acquisition Study (ISAS); more detail is available at: http://dni.gov/Innovative Space Acquisition Briefing.ppt</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />Please send a five page concept paper or 10 page briefing package, by 30 Nov 2011, to the email address listed below, describing your ideas and including your contact information. As appropriate, we will contact you for clarification.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES This RFI is issued solely for information and potential planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the ODNI is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Proprietary concepts and information should not be included in the submittal. If classified information would enhance the submission, contact the points of contact below to arrange for that submission. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by ODNI from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

<RESPDATE>111411
<CONTACT>I2O BAA Coordinator, Email see_admin_address@announcement.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">DARPA-SN-12-13<br />DARPA I2O<br />Active Authentication<br />Proposer Day - November 18, 2011<br />Arlington, VA</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Innovation Office (I2O) will conduct a briefing in support of the anticipated Research Announcement (RA) for the Active Authentication program. When released, the RA will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Grants.gov website, http://www.grants.gov. This Proposer Day is unclassified.</p>
<p>Attendance at the Active Authentication Proposer Day is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent solicitations (if any) on this topic. The Proposer Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or abstracts. This announcement is issued solely for information and program planning purposes and is not a Request for Information (RFI). Since this is not an RFI, no submissions against this notice will be accepted by the Government. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this Proposer Day. Interested parties to this notice are cautioned that nothing herein obligates the Government to issue a solicitation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The goal of the Active Authentication Program is to advance research in the area of new software biometric modalities for the purpose of eventually using those biometric modalities for computer system authentication. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, software, or systems in the areas related to determining the identity of the individual at the keyboard. The focus of this research will be on determining identity through use of software applications that can determine identity through the activities the user normally performs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. <br />The Active Authentication program changes the current paradigm by removing the secret that a human holds, the password, and focuses on the secret that the human specifically is. This program will focus on validating the individual at the keyboard by those unique factors that make up the individual, (often referred to as biometrics). The goal of the Active Authentication is to find these biometrics factors of the person as the person is working, without interrupting their normal activities. The program will initially focus on authentication at a desktop in a Department of Defense office environment. These software biometrics will capture the unique aspects of the person that can be observed through software, which will minimize operational deployment requirements.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br /><br />The purpose of the Active Authentication Proposer Day is fourfold:<br />1. To familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in new approaches to innovative software based biometric modalities.<br />2. To familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in enhanced security evaluation through participation of Red Teams or Adversarial Partnership approaches in support of the research performed in this program.<br />3. To identify potential proposers and promote understanding of the anticipated Active Authentication RA proposal requirements<br />4. To promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.</p>
<p>It is DARPA's desire to receive comprehensive, quality responses to the anticipated Active Authentication RA. To assist those wanting to form strong, collaborative teaming efforts and business relationships, a teaming website will be established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties. Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense endorses the destination website or the information and organizations contained therein. The website address will be provided in the RA.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding the Active Authentication RA will be available at http://www.darpa.mil/Opportunities/Solicitations/I2O_Solicitations.aspx, following the publication of the RA on FBO. It is anticipated that the Active Authentication RA will be released by the end of November 2011. If an RA is released, materials presented at the Proposer Day, as well as a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document, compiling questions and answers received to date, may be made available at http://www.darpa.mil/Opportunities/Solicitations/I2O_Solicitations.aspx.</p>
<p>A live feed from the Active Authentication Proposer Day will be available via an open meeting on Defense Connect Online (DCO) and through a commercial webcast to all registered participants. A copy of the video will be posted on DARPA's website after the Proposer Day until February 3, 2012.</p>
<p>TENTATIVE AGENDA:<br /><br />Registration: 0930-1000 EDT<br />Presentations/Discussions: 1000-1300 EDT</p>
<p>LOCATION:<br /><br />3811 Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22203</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:

The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) has a requirement for the purchase and installation of energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and functional office furniture and systems to accommodate approximately 150 employees and support contractors.The contractor  will provide office furniture and energy-saving technologies integrated into office furniture, all of which will be installed in ARPA-E?s new office space on the 8th floor of 950 L?Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC.  ARPA-E is seeking to establish a showcase for energy-efficient technologies.  ARPA-E?s statutory mission includes ?reductions of energy-related emissions? and ?improvement in the energy efficiency of all economic sectors.?  It is ARPA-E?s ambition to establish a high-water mark in energy savings for other Federal agencies to emulate, much as the Green Building Council established a showcase for private sector firms to emulate.  The desired furniture incorporates energy-saving technology that will reduce ARPA-E?s overall energy usage.  Some of the furniture under this action may not include the energy saving technologies, but is included in this procurement to ensure aesthetic and dimensional compatibility and uniformity with the office furniture incorporated energy savings technologies The Government intends to compete this requirement only among Herman Miller, Inc. distributors.  The period of performance will be four (4) months.Herman Miller is unique in its ability to provide certain energy saving technologies that will enable ARPA-E to further its statutory mission and create a showcase for energy-efficient technologies.  Herman Miller is the exclusive source for ?Energy Manager,? a device added to Herman Miller systems furniture to improve its performance by saving energy.  Energy Manager controls two of the four circuits of power in a cluster of workstations.  When a person sits down to work, an occupancy sensor detects their presence and turns on the devices in the cluster plugged into those two circuits-task lights, printers, monitors, chargers, etc.  When the cluster in unoccupied, the devices automatically turn off.  Herman Miller?s Energy Manager Technology will enable ARPA-E to further statutory mission and will help ARPA-E to realize its ambition to create a showcase for energy-efficient technogies. In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.405-6, this action is a limited source competition seeking energy-saving technology particular to one manufacturer.  It is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program.  The use of brand name descriptions in this acquisition is necessary for ARPA-E?s requirements, as there are no other manufacturers of like technology.  This is a notice of intent and no solicitation is available for this requirement.Interested parties may submit capability statements and rationale by _December 9, 2011 at 11:00am via e-mail to annette.brown@hq.doe.gov.   The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC><p>This notice announces a U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) Industry Day to be held on December 1, 2011 at the Dallas Field Office located at: 8101 North Stemmons FWY, Dallas, Texas 75247. The Industry Day will be held on the second floor of the building starting at 12:30 pm and will last until approximately 4:30 pm.</p>
<p>All business sizes are welcome to participate; however, ICE is trying to determine small business interest. All information received in response to this notice will be used to determine the appropriateness of any small business set-aside for this requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement: Transportation</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a continuing need for transportation services to provide, operate, and manage the transportation of detainees in ICE custody for the Dallas Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>
<p>DO duties include but are not limited to armed transportation services, escorting detainees to and from transport vehicles, monitoring detainees in custody, and conducting limited pat-downs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish these services including management staff, supervision, manpower, relief officers, uniforms, equipment and supplies (including transport vehicles, firearms, body restraints, non-lethal devices, body armor, cellular telephones and radios) to provide transportation services for the most part during the week days.

The Contractor shall assign at a minimum per vehicle, two person teams of armed DOs and provide a minimum of one (1) DO of the same gender of the detainee(s) being transported.</p>
<p>Contractor DOs shall not be tied to specific routes within the contract. DOs may be used to provide transportation and guard services as needed as consistent with the job description above.

<p>The estimated number of detainees to be transported may vary day to day. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the detainees are transported in the most safe and economical manner.</p>
<p>An advanced list of routes and frequencies will be provided to those attending the Industry Day. If you are not able to attend, the routes and frequencies will be provided in the RFP. The current estimate is that there are 131 routes in the Dallas AOR listed as daily (28), 1 to 3 times a week (58) and as needed (45). Based on the estimated number of detainees per trip, it will be up to the Contractor to provide the appropriate transport vehicle (bus, van, and/or sedan).</p>
<p>Required Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>Business Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor is responsible to obtain all business permits and licenses prior to performance of the contract.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall (depending on the state's requirements) be licensed as a quality security company in accordance with the requirements of the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; Throughout the term of this contract, the Contractor shall maintain currency of ALL permits/business licenses and make them available for government inspection.

<p>Personnel Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Background Investigations and Suitability Screenings will be conducted on all Contract Employees by the Office of Professional Responsibility and Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU).<br />&bull; The Contractor shall agree that each employee working on this contract will successfully pass the DHS Employment Eligibility Verification (E-Verify) program operated by USCIS to establish work authorization and U.S. Citizenship.<br />&bull; Employees must reside in the United States.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: A new technique developed by NASA enables the preparation of metal/composite hybridlaminates, also known as fibermetal laminates (FML), through a one-step processingmethod. Currently FMLs are prepared by a compression process using a press or autoclavewith metallic layers sandwiched between layers of glass or graphite prepreg(preimpregnated fibers with a matrix resin). NASAs process essentially eliminates theneed to produce prepreg prior to the production of a hybrid laminate. It also allows theproduction of large, net shape structures that were previously not possible withautoclave or press technologies due to size constraints. Essentially, it involves aninfusion process whereby matrix resin transversely infiltrates fiber layers that havebeen sandwiched between plies of metal foil containing flow pathways to produce ametal/composite hybrid laminate. The infiltration can be accomplished using pressure(resin transfer molding [RTM]), or a vacuum induced pressure differential (vacuumassisted resin transfer molding [VARTM]).The FMLs resulting from the NASA process have similar properties to traditionallyproduced metal/composite hybrid laminates including, as compared to either the compositeor metal only structures, improved load carrying capability, lighter weight, improvedstiffness, improved impact resistance and damage tolerance, and improved permeationresistance. The NASA process can be applied to various FML types, including GLARE (glass,aluminum, epoxy), and TIGR (titanium, graphite). Typical manufacturing processes arecostly and complex shapes are hard to produce, whereby the NASA process enables use ofthese kinds of laminates without an autoclave or press, thus increasing the size that canbe produced and decreasing the cost.The resin pathways in the foils enable connection between the plies that can improve theinterlaminar strength of the final part. Functionally the NASA process creates resincolumns in the transverse direction of the plies. NASA is working to optimize the finalproperties by varying the size and distribution of the pathways.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan at: NASA LangleyResearch Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) - Atlantic's (SSC-A) Requestfor Information (RFI) is for a GSM Cellular Stand-alone system to support theAfghanistan security and police forces with cellular capabilities.Submissions are due no later than noon on November 18, 2011.SSC-A has been tasked to provide an emergency cellular communication capabilityfor up to twenty (23) districts within Afghanistan.  The mission of the systemis to provide 24/7 emergency service to the local population (system mustsupport programming select 3 digit numbers that may vary from district todistrict) and allow a select number of Afghanistan Local Police (ALP)communications via 10-digit numbers using closely controlled SubscriberIdentity Module (SIM) cards/phones to support this emergency communicationnetwork.  The local populace can only leverage the service to support emergencycommunications with the local/regional police using the defined 3 digit numberfor that district.The phase one (1) capability is for six (6) INITIAL (start-up) sites with anexpansion to seventeen (17) sites making it a total of twenty-three (23) sites.The intent of this RFI is to obtain G2/G3 GSM small form factor highlyintegrate-able Cellular System COTS product information that can restore,establish and/or expand emergency voice and short message services (SMS) withthe desired effect of providing 24 hour x seven day per week (24 x 7) policecommunity "emergency service" calling capability.

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Graduate-level course in Structured Decision Making (SDM) and Adaptive Management (AM).
This is not an announcement of a Solicitation, but rather a Request for Information (RFI).  The U.S. Geological Survey needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide an accredited, graduate-level course in Structured Decision Making (SDM) and Adaptive Management (AM).  
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services.
The use of Structured Decision Making and Adaptive Management for addressing complex, natural resource management issues is being advocated by Department of the Interior Policy (DOI; 522 DM) as well as USGS administrators. Compliance with this DOI directive is unfortunately hampered by the fact that most state and federal land managers have little, if any, background in this arena.  Consequently, the Cooperative Research Units Program (CRU) is looking to provide ready access to a graduate level course in SDM/AM which is not currently available at most of our host universities. Given CRU's legislated mission of providing graduate education to produce the nation's future fish and wildlife resource managers, developing the course as an accredited, graduate-level course is a logical and appropriate way to build SDM/AM capacity throughout DOI and state agency land managers and administrators. The USGS is performing market research for a graduate-level, accredited course in Structured Decision Making and Adaptive Management that is specifically developed in a natural resources context with emphasis on fisheries and wildlife.  This is an advanced, graduate-level course designed to teach future practitioners how to effectively implement SDM/AM approaches including the applied use of common analytical tools for making decisions on complex natural resource issues often plagued with numerous sources of uncertainty.  It is important to note this is not an introductory course targeted at managers and administrators who simply need to understand the approach and know when it is appropriate. Numerous resources already exist to meet that general need.  
The course needs to fully address all components of the SDM process and how and when the SDM process becomes Adaptive Management.  The course should include a lecture component (50%) that focuses on the elements and key concepts of the SDM approach and a lab component (50%) that includes exercises and use of analytical tools that support and reinforce the lecture concepts. Lectures and labs must use relevant, contemporary natural resource issues and problems as examples and case studies. The course must also include both synchronous and asynchronous learning components.  Given the broad geographic distribution of potential enrollees (40 units in 38 states), an asynchronous component will be required for delivering of some of the concepts and materials (as appropriate); However, the complexity of the course material will also require a synchronous component for instructor-led, interactive discussions and exercises.  
Interested parties who believe they have the knowledge, expertise, ability and infrastructure to develop and deliver an accredited, graduate-level course in SDM/AM for up to ten (10) enrollees annually are invited to submit a Capability Statement (including a proposed course syllabus), not to exceed 10 pages.  Response should include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email address, business type, and approximate cost information (i.e. rough order of magnitude).  Additionally, a description of the system to be used and its capabilities for delivering synchronous and asynchronous components should be included. 
Accessibility Considerations:  The course delivery system must fully comply with accessibility requirements as mandated per Section 508 of the Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (http://www.section508.gov).
Past performance information should be submitted for applicable references for other courses delivered within the last three (3) years.  Demonstration of the capabilities for delivering synchronous and asynchronous learning components may be requested as part of the market research.  Complete contact information for the reference to include contact name, telephone and email, in addition to the business name, the times the course was delivered, and brief description of the courses that were provided.

<p>(a) Contract line item 0001, 0002 &amp; 0003 is incrementally funded. The sum of tiny_mce_marker____ is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is contained in paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximate the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).</p>
<p>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any costs for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state</p>
<p>(1) the estimate date when that point will be reached and</p>
<p>(2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (I) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.</p>
<p>The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotment by the date identified in the Contractor's notified, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitle "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT".</p>
<p>(d) additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds.

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable<br />document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>
<p>For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly:</p>
<p>-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number: <br />-CAGE Code: <br />-Issue Date: <br />-Issue By DoDAAC: <br />-Admin DoDAAC: <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC: <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC: <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code): <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*: <br />-Pay DoDAAC:</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>
<p>(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.<br /><br />(xv) Quotes are required to be received NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM, MDT, Tuesday, 15 Nov 2011. All quotes must be emailed to kathryn.cortes@malmstrom.af.mil or faxed to (406)731-4005 to the attention of Kathryn Cortes. Please follow-up quote submission with a phone call to ensure receipt.</p>

As Authorized under FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, will be used to evaluate offer and award this requirement.  The Government will evaluate each offeror's submission to ensure that it reflects a sound understanding of this requirement. The Government will award the contract to a contractor whose proposal represents the Lowest Price proposal after evaluation and in accordance with the solicitation.  Only those proposals determined to be Technically Acceptable will be eligible for award.  Offerors whose proposals are determined "Unacceptable" will not be further evaluated.  For a proposal to be determined "Technically Acceptable" and receive consideration for award based upon low price submitted, the proposal must receive a rating of "Acceptable" for the technical acceptability factor/elements and past performance factor.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions and reserves the right to conduct clarifications and/or hold discussion if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.<br><br>	       2.  The Government will evaluate proposed prices for reasonableness using price analysis techniques.  <br><br>	       3.  Unbalanced prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the offeror has demonstrated a lack of understanding of the requirement.<br><br><br>	(b)  Evaluation Criteria<br><br>	      1.  Evaluation Criteria Factors and Elements.  The proposals will be evaluated under three evaluation factors:  Relevant Experience and Price.  <br><br>Factor 1: Relevant Experience<br><br>Factor 2: Price<br><br>                        Factor 1 - Relevant Experience.  <br><br>(1) The Responders are required to identify and submit recent and relevant experience information.  Recent is defined as within the past three (3) calendar years from the release date of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Relevant experience is defined as work performed that is similar in size, scope, and complexity to that required by the PWS.  <br><br>     (2) Responders will provide a detailed description of identical or similar relevant experience in the performance of services as specified in the PWS from the last three years that will enable the Responder to successfully execute the proposed approach and satisfy the requirements of the Task Order.  In addition to a detailed description of the services provided, the Responders must also provide the information shown below for each relevant experience provided.<br><br>o	Name and Address of Organization<br>o	Point of Contact and Phone Number<br>o	Contracting Officer's  Representative and Phone Number<br>o	Contract/Task Order Number<br>o	Date of Award and Amount of Contract/Task Order<br><br>     (3) Discuss the relevance of the experience in terms of nature, size, complexity of the Task Order, the value of the contract/task order awarded, type of contract/task order, and duration as compared to this requirement within the last three years.<br><br>     (4) Relevant Experience should be discussed for all teaming partners and/or subcontractors proposed to support this requirement.<br><br>                      Assigning Ratings.  The Relevant Experience Factor will be assigned "Acceptable" or Unacceptable" rating as follows:<br><br>Rating	Description<br>Acceptable	Based on offeror's Relevant Experience record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See below).<br>Unacceptable	Based on offeror's Relevant Experience record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br><br>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant experience or for whom information on relevant experience is not available or so sparse that no meaningful relevant experience rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will not be considered. <br><br>                      Factor 2 - Price.  Price will not be assigned an adjectival rating.  Price will be evaluated to determine if the offerors proposed price is fair, reasonable, and balanced utilizing price analysis techniques in accordance with the guidelines in FAR 13.106-2(b).  The Government will award only one contract to the offeror whose acceptable proposal represents the lowest price to the Government.<br><br>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1 Introduction</p>
<p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) protects the retirement incomes of 44.4 million American workers in 31,200 defined benefit pension plans.

This combined synopsis lists one or more clauses by reference with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text (FAR 52.252-2). The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition with the following addendum to the provisions of the standard provisions. 

EVALUATION PROCEDURES:   Offerors are responsible for providing a proposal inclusive of accurate and complete information for evaluation.  (Failure to do so may rule the proposed unacceptable.)  The Government will perform a best value/trade off selection. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation; will be the most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the requirement. Only those offerors determined to be in compliance with the requirements as stated in this solicitation will be considered for award.  Non-conformance with this requirement may result in offeror's quote being determined unacceptable.

The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 

Late offers - Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered. 

Provision at 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 1999) The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract with a one-year Base Period and four (4), one-year Options to the offeror whose proposal the Government determines is the most advantageous (i.e. "Best Value"), price and other factors considered. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The government will use the tradeoff process in making its best value award decision.  This process will permit the Government to make tradeoffs among price and non price factors which allows the Government to make award to other than the lowest priced proposal.  However, price may become the deciding factor for award of the contract should the government determine that non-price factors between proposals are approximately equal.  The following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance apply:


1.  Price - All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  The offeror shall provide sufficient information to allow the Government to perform cost analysis to determine price fair and reasonable. Offerors are reminded that pricing schedules are necessary for the EACH, the base year and each option period.  Please complete the Price/Cost Schedule and submit according to instructions.

2.  Technical Capability - Provide a summary, no more than three pages, addressing the offeror's technical capabilities in accordance with all requirements in the Statement of Work and Line Item Descriptions in the Price/Cost Schedule.  

3.  Past Performance - The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the proposed requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. In this context, "offeror" refers to the proposed prime contractor and all proposed major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing critical services or whose subcontract is for more than 50% of the total proposed price. In either case, the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors will be assessed individually and the results will then be assessed in their totality to derive the offeror's Performance Risk rating.

Follow the instructions for submitting the Past/Present Performance Reference Form for at least three (3) references using the guidance below: 
 
The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.  Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices and timely performance (provide no more than three (3) verifiable references with contact information. The Government will assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar, relevant work, to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous similar relevant work.

The Government requests that the Relevant Past Performance Questionnaire, be forwarded to no more than three (3) references, completed by your references, and returned by your references directly to Ms Monica Kinderknecht via fax (615) 225-6432, or email monica.kinderknecht@va.gov.  Relevant past performance questionnaires should be received by 3: PM CST on November 21, 2011.  Failure to omit may result in rejection of your proposal.   

Technical and past performance when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

RATING SCALE 

The following Rating Scale provides the definitions for the Past Performance ratings to be 
assessed: 

E  EXCEPTIONAL 

Based on the Offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the 
Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit. 
Contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which 
corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were highly effective. 

 V  VERY GOOD 

Based on the Offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit. 
Contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problem(s) for 
which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were effective. 

S  SATISFACTORY 

Based on the Offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements. Contractual performance contains some minor 
problem(s) for which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor appear or 
where satisfactory. 

M  MARGINAL 

Based on Offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has not met 
some contractual requirements. Contractual performance reflects a serious 
problem for which either the contractor has not yet identified correction 
action(s), or the proposed corrective action(s) appear only marginally effective 
or were not fully implemented. 

U  UNSATIFACTORY 

Based on Offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has not met 
most contractual requirements, and recovery did not occur or was not in a 
timely manner. Contractual performance contains serious problem(s) for which 
the contractor's corrective action(s) appear or were ineffective. 

N  NEUTRAL 

No performance record identifiable; unknown performance This is neither a 
negative nor positive assessment.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION/SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
NAICS Code: 541380 The Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a contract for Radioisotope Analysis of Sediment/Soil Samples, for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) Ecosystems Research Branch (ERB), Ecological Exposure Research Division (EERD). 
A fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. The resulting contract is expected to have a Period of Performance of a 24 Month Base Period. The Period of Performance would begin December, 2011 ending November, 2013. 
The associated NAICS Code is 541380 with a size standard of $12 million dollars. This procurement will be made under FAR Part 12.6 provisions. 
This effort will support the ORD/NERL/ERD/EERD's responsibilities pertaining to the need for conducting research on sediment and nutrient accretion functions associated with different wetlands from numerous parts of the country to obtain rates of organic matter and nutrient accretion and burial in different wetland and estuarine systems. Abundances of elemental radioisotopes in soil and sediment profiles will be used to measure accretion and burial rates.  Radioisotopes frequently used are 137Cs (T1/2 = 30 yr) and 210Pb (22.3 yr). 137Cesium is produced by above ground nuclear weapon explosions, and has a peak exposure of 1964 that can be used as a date marker for subsequent soil accretion.  210Lead radioisotope accumulates naturally and will be used to measure soil accretion rates over the past 100 to 150 years.  These parameters will be coupled with other measurements (e.g., TC, TP, TN) to obtain rates of organic matter and nutrient accretion and burial in different wetland  and estuarine systems.  Understanding wetland functions associated with nutrient accretion and sequestration assists in understanding the dynamism in biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon and the net ecosystem benefits received from nutrient assimilation and elemental sequestration by wetlands.  Thus, accretion rates developed from 137Cs and 210Pb measurements in estuarine and freshwater wetland sediment and soil cores will provide US EPA with critical data necessary to calculate the wetland ecosystem services of nutrient removal and carbon sequestration.  The contractor shall analyze estuarine sediments and wetland soils (hereafter referred to as ?wetland samples?) for 137Cs and 210Pb activity.  Wetland samples will be obtained from sediment and soil cores provided by US EPA.  Wetland samples will be homogenized by EPA and a dry weight of at least 25 g or greater will be provided to the contractor for radiometric analyses.  Wetland sample mass will vary based on bul k density of the soil.  Wetland samples will be labeled by EPA using a simple sequential numbering scheme (i.e., Site A #001, Site A #002, etc.). Wetland samples will be sent in batches of 50, with the first batch sent on a date identified by the US EPA Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).  The contractor shall process the wetland samples within 30 days or less of receipt of the samples, and provide the raw data on radioisotopic activity to the EPA at that time.
Please find the following attachments which include: 1) Draft SOW, 2) Evaluation Criteria, 3) Pricing Sheet.
All questions can be submitted to the undersigned via email correspondence only.
Proposals will be due November 28th, 2011 NLT 5:00 pm EST.
This solicitation and amendments will be available via the internet at the following URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/index.htm.

When passes are required for non-government affiliated persons, the contractor provides appropriate point of contact poc's names, passport, and social security numbers no less than eight days prior to the scheduled event to the pass and I.D. office so authorizations can be obtained.<br />12. The contractor holder or commissioner (can be same as contract holder) is responsible for scheduling officials to work games. The Youth Sports Office will be notified immediately of any commissioner changes. The name of this person and an alternate will be designated in writing to the contracting office prior to the start of contract performance. The contractor and or commissioner are not allowed to participate as a player, coach, team manager, for any of the sports covered by this contract. <br />13. Contractor/Commissioner evaluates officials during the season and provides officiating training before each sport begins. If any officiating skill deficiencies are noted, the contractor takes immediate action to correct the situation.<br />14. The contractor must notify the Youth Sports office 2 hours prior before the first scheduled game if for an unforeseen reason the officials scheduled to work will not be showing up for the obligated scheduled games. If the contractor fails to notify the Youth Sports office by this time, the contractor will have monetary penalties equivalent to one and &frac12; days pay reduced from payment on the current months billing. <br />15. If a game or portion of a game must be replayed due to a valid protest on a rule misinterpretation or inappropriate call made by an official, the officials will be obligated to fulfill officiating responsibilities for that replayed portion of the game and will not be paid for the replayed portion.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>1. The Youth Sports program shall provide all equipment and supplies necessary for teams to play the sport (balls, time clock, score books, etc.) In addition the Youth Sports Program will also provide the field or court space, time and scrimmage teams for contractor to conduct an official's clinic.</p>
<p>2. Appropriate playing sites; the maintenance, repair, cleaning and care of these facilities and sites for competitions, tournaments and clinics shall be the responsibility of the Youth Sports office and its staff. There shall be no responsibility for the preparation of fields or courts of play by the officials or contract holder.</p>
<p>3. The Youth Sports office shall provide the officials with any and all modifications to the rules which are in the form of by-laws at least two weeks in advance of the games to be worked.</p>
<p>4. The Youth Sports Director or Sports office staff shall provide the contractor with a complete schedule of games at least two (2) weeks in advanced of scheduled events. Tournament dates shall be coordinated with the officials as far in advance as possible, but no later than one (1) week before the tournament. The tournament schedule may be subject to change by the government due to inclement weather, acts of God, or military related problems and commitments. This schedule shall include all pertinent information necessary for the officials to conduct the games such as rules modifications.</p>
<p>5. When games are not played due to a forfeit by a team because a team did not have the required number of players to start, the officials shall be paid only &frac12; of the regular game fee for game/s that are not worked but forfeited. This is provided that the officials were at the game site at the scheduled start time for the game. Official forfeit time for a team is 10 minutes after scheduled game time.</p>
<p>6. If it is becoming apparent that weather might be a factor in creating unsafe playing conditions, the decision to cancel, postpone or reschedule a game, will be made by the Youth Sports office staff only. This will be done 2 hours prior to the scheduled game time on the day in which the game was to be played. If weather becomes a factor during game play, again the responsibility to cancel, delay or postpone the game will be made by the Youth Sports office staff person only. Officials working games which are not fully concluded at the time of postponement or cancellation will be paid for a full game if more than half the game was booked and the game is considered an "official" game. If a smaller portion of the game was conducted the officials will be paid only &frac12; of a regular or full game fee. <br /><br />7. Officials will not be paid for cancelled games if notified by the Youth Sports office when at least 2 hours prior notice is given to contract holder or commissioner on the day that the competition was to be officiated. The Youth Sports program office shall notify the contract holder or commissioner of all postponed or cancelled games at least 2 hour prior of the first game is scheduled to be played. It is then the contract or commissioners responsibility to contact scheduled officials to notify them of the cancellation.</p>
<p>8. Rescheduled games which have been postponed due to weather or safety conditions will be rescheduled by the Youth Sports staff only. Notification of the rescheduled games will be provided the contract holder or commissioner no less than two days or 48 hours prior to the competition so that the contractor or commissioner may have ample time to find officials to work the rescheduled games.</p>
<p>9. The Youth Sports Director reserves the right to critique each official's performance and may recommend to the contract holder that certain individuals be removed from future officiating duties if the quality of their officiating is not improved.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hire a Software Engineer within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD).</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Software Engineer will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The OTI Software Engineer will be supervised by the Chief, Operations Management Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the relevant OTI Team Leader for specific assignments.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The Software Engineer has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. OFDA's Office of the Director is responsible for management of OFDA's strategic relationship with international organizations and non-governmental organizations, leading external coordination efforts with traditional and non-traditional donors, leading efforts in humanitarian policy and humanitarian architecture work, setting the strategic direction for OFDA's work with multi-lateral organizations, and establishing OFDA policy on a range of humanitarian issues and managing global programs.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Senior Disaster Operations Specialists (SDOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk reduction programs. They assist in developing response strategies, in managing all aspects of grants for humanitarian donor organizations, and in preparing talking points, information products, and briefing material. They manage complex portfolios consisting of one or several countries with multiple and sometimes competing priorities, and are members of regionally focused humanitarian response teams consisting of Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs), a Regional Coordinator, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists. The SDOS provides technical guidance and mentoring to DOSs and serves as a focal point for program-related planning efforts.</p>
<p>SDOSs are part of the Disaster Response Team (DRT) within DRM. This team consists of five regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA) and Sudan. Each regional group is managed by a Regional Coordinator.</p>
<p>SDOSs demonstrate a mastery of a regional area of specialization, extensive knowledge in a wide range of humanitarian concepts, principles, and practices with demonstrated ability to apply this knowledge in to difficult and complex work in environments. The SDOS must also have an expertise in USG assistance award management from the USG perspective, including the ability to apply this expertise to developing recommendations to resolve complex issues.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Offerors shall limit the SOC to 25 pages, including attachments.<br /><br />The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition shall be 336411 with a size standard of 1500 employees. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this acquisition. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. <br /><br />The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting POC identified below. The Ombudsman is Brigadier General David A. Harris, AAC/CV, located at 101 West D Ave., Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542.

<DESC><p>This is a 5-year, 2-step, open-ended Broad Agency Announcement to solicit white papers. The Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA)/Modernization Directorate is soliciting white papers for research in the five following medical modernization areas:</p>
<p>Force Health Protection - Focus in Force Health Protection (FHP) is focused on technologies to prevent injury and illness, and the early recognition or detection of emerging threats. The intent is to pursue R&amp;D/technology advancement integration into existing risk assessment/reduction processes to reduce the manpower, time, and/or logistical impact; increase the capability to characterize exposures; and provide near real-time risk information to Commanders. The FHP focus areas are Directed Energy (DE), Occupational &amp; Environmental Health (OEH) Hazards, and Personalized Medicine Initiatives. Current projections demonstrate that the Directed Energy and Occupational &amp; Environmental Health focus areas dominate research needs in the FHP thrust area.</p>
<p>Enroute Care - Focus is to maximize technological advancements and groundbreaking clinical research to match care during transport with state of the art ground medicine throughout the continuum. Research is needed to address knowledge gaps during patient transport and staging. The knowledge gained will be used to ensure that the best care is provided to our wounded/ill service members as they are moved through the system. Research/technology development is also needed on non-invasive and specific methods for assessing trauma resuscitation and timing of interventions and transport. Clinical research is needed to complement critical care and routine patient transport technology development. EC Thrust Area focus is on continuum of care during transport of patients from point of injury to point of definitive care. Key areas include: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE); Patient Staging; and Critical Care Air Transport equipment and treatment research. The three broad areas of research include: <br />&bull; Physiological Effects of Aeromedical Evacuation <br />&bull; Enroute Trauma and Resuscitative Care<br />&bull; Enroute Patient Safety</p>
<p>Operational Medicine/In-Garrison - Focus in Operational Medicine is to ensure the provision of the highest quality health care for active duty members and their families. Based on the Military Health Services priorities, gaps identified in the AFMS 2009 Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) and the needs/gaps of the MAJCOMs, the following research focus areas were identified. Operational Medicine research and technology development focus areas include clinical patient safety, psychological health/resilience, obesity, and autism.</p>
<p>Expeditionary Medicine - Focus is to enhance or improve expeditionary medical care during contingency operations including: improvement of expeditionary equipment capability enhancements by addressing needs related to platform capability sustainability (energy, supplies and materials); miniaturization of equipment to reduce logistics footprint, technology identification; development and/or validation of next-generation critical humanitarian/disaster relief equipment/material sets; deployed casualty care optimization and improvements; and field identification, diagnosis and treatment of emerging threat Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) injuries. This research aims to address issues related to care in the expeditionary setting and the inherent challenges in those missions.</p>
<p>Human Performance: Focus in Human Performance encompasses research and technology development interests in Cognitive Performance and Fatigue Management, Physiological Performance and Targeted Conditioning, Operational and Environmental Challenges to Performance, Training for Optimal Performance of AF Medical Personnel, and Personnel Selection for Performance. These focus areas are further defined and discussed in the subsequent sections. The overall aims of AFMS Human Performance research are to enhance, optimize and maintain personnel's performance in carrying out their assigned missions. The research performed is intended to address unique AF operational needs, with the possibility of collateral benefit to other DoD entities.</p>

<DESC>The following changes were made:<br><br>(1) The original posting of the synopsis indicated that the Service Contract Act is applicable.  We believe that the services related to this requirement require the use of Professional Employees, therefore, the Service Contract Act would not be applicable.  <br><br>(2) The place of performance has been updated to show the correct location.  The correct location is: <br>Building 1109<br>Fort Lee, Virginia<br><br>(3) We received questions regarding this requirement.  Please see below for answers to those questions.  <br><br>QUESTION 1: I don't see a requirement for a background check or possible security clearance requirement.  You do specify the IA requirement: DFARS 252.239-7001, Information Assurance Contractor Training and Certification but not a general clearance level, please advise.<br><br>ANSWER 1:  The efforts required for this task are expected to be UNCLASSIFIED and should not require the contract personnel to obtain a security clearance.  However, if the tasking performance requires access to classified data, a security clearance of SECRET will be required for all personnel having access to the classified data and a DD Form 254 will be submitted before work commences.<br><br>QUESTION 2:  Does an accounting system have to be approved prior to submitting proposals or at the time of Contract award?  <br><br>ANSWER 2:  Clause 252.242-7006  " Accounting System Administration"  states "The Contractor shall establish and maintain an acceptable accounting system."  An acceptable accounting system is defined in that clause.  This requirement must be satisfied prior to contract award.  We recommend that if your company does not have an accounting system that was determined to be acceptable in accordance with DFARs 242.75 and Clause 252.242-7006, that you attempt to obtain evidence of an acceptable accounting system, as soon as possible.  <br><br><br>QUESTION 3:  Do you plan on providing the final solicitations only to businesses that respond to the synopsis? <br><br>ANSWER 3:  No, the final solicitation will be posted on the Fedbizopps website, to provide the opportunity for all small businesses to propose. <br>

INTRODUCTION <br><br>Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), a U.S. Army garrison, located in South Central Missouri is requesting, via this Request for Interest (RFI), responses from suppliers of electricity interested in submitting a proposal for full requirements power supply to FLW.  <br><br>The purpose of the RFI is to solicit information from qualified electrical suppliers to ascertain availability of capacity and interest in supplying FLW's electrical needs.  <br><br>Please note that an expression of interest in providing this energy product is neither binding nor promissory.  Responses will be used for planning purposes in determining available resources for firming Fort Leonard Wood's electrical needs.  Additionally, failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude the ability to respond to any future Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the purchase of energy products if issued at a later date.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP at a later date.  This RFI does not commit FLW to contract for any supply or service, nor is FLW seeking contract proposals at this time.  Responders are advised that FLW will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI and that all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested responder's expense.<br> <br>In light of the amount of time required for respondents to provide such information and for FLW to evaluate it, a decision as to whether to proceed with an RFP cannot be expected prior to January 2012.  <br>2. DESCRIPTION OF REQUEST: <br><br>FLW is issuing this RFI in an effort to solicit interest in the provision of wholesale, firm full-requirements energy supply, and corresponding capacity and ancillary services.  The requested power will be delivered to an interconnection or interface on the Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI) system border.  AECI is a consumer-owned rural electric generation and transmission cooperative that provides transmission service over facilities located in the States of Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma.  A copy of the Transmission Service Agreement between AECI and FLW is attached as Attachment 1.  AECI will provide transmission service from the AECI border to Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative (Sho-Me).  Sho-Me will deliver the electric power from its interface with AECI to FLW.  FLW has a transmission service agreement with Sho-Me for the delivery of power.<br><br>AECI will provide to FLW, through their Open Access Transmission Tariff, two ancillary services (Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service and Reactive Supply, and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service).  Suppliers responding to this RFI must document how they intend to provide the other ancillary services (Regulation and Frequency Response Service, Energy Imbalance Service, Operating Reserve-Spinning Service, Operation Reserve-Supplemental Service, and Generator Imbalance Service).  Responders must have the capability, and should identify how they intend to forecast and schedule FLW's load, whether dynamically or in hourly blocks, and provide associated ancillary services. All projected costs for providing these services must be broken out and included in your response.  <br><br>Supply will begin January 1, 2013.  However, for planning purposes it is necessary to have an agreement in place no later than June 30, 2012. FLW is targeting a contract term between 1 and 5 years in length.  Over the most recent 12-months, FLW had a peak demand of 55 MW and consumed approximately 244,000 MWh.  Attachment 2 shows the monthly demands (kW), energy consumption (kWh) and load factors for the 12 month period ending September 30, 2011.  The expected demand in 2013 is 65 MW with a 5% annual load growth for each year through 2017.<br><br>FLW, as a U.S. government entity, is subject to certain policy mandates governing its purchase and use of electricity, specifically renewable energy.  Therefore, respondents to this RFI should identify how they intend to assist FLW in meeting the target of sourcing at least 7.5% of its annual electricity needs from renewable resources, per the Federal Energy Policy Act-2005. <br>3.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:<br><br>As indicated above, AECI and Sho-Me Power will provide transmission service from the AECI border to FLW.  AECI and Sho-Me will bill FLW for said transmission service. Thus these services should not be included as part of your submission.  <br>  <br>Alternative proposals to meet the installations energy requirements are welcomed. However, any alternative proposals must fully explain the rationale and include a cause & effect (pros/cons) statement associated with applying the alternative.  <br><br><br>4.  RFI SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: <br><br>In addition to being able to successfully provide the above-mentioned power supply attributes, all responses to this RFI must meet the following requirements to be considered:<br><br>1.	Please provide a description of your company, specifically identifying the legal entity that would be contracting under a potential agreement.<br><br>2.	Please indicate the long-term debt rating (S&P, Moody and/or Fitch) of the legal entity that would be acting as the contracting party in this transaction.  If such information is not available, please provide other financial information, including D&B number or audited financials, which would be sufficient to evaluate the financial standing of the contracting party.<br><br>3.	Please include a description of the types of products that will be offered to meet FLW's energy requirements, such as on-peak/off-peak energy blocks, index pricing and fixed pricing.  Also, provide a description of the flexibility that will be available under the pricing options, such as required notice for purchasing blocks, sell back of excess block energy purchased and the index that will be used for pricing for market purchases. <br><br>4.	Please provide sample contracts for all product types offered, specifying standard terms and conditions.<br><br>5.	Please include contact name, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address for communications regarding this RFI.<br><br>6.	Please provide indicative pricing for each term and product offered, including the effect on pricing of meeting FLW's renewable energy goals.  As discussed above pricing for terms from one to five years is desireable.<br><br><br>5.  PROCESS AND TIMING: <br><br>1. Timing: Interest packages submitted in response to this RFI must be received by FLW on or before December 9, 2011.   <br><br>2.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) as a sponsor of the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) has a requirement for program and financial management services, technical expertise in facilitation support, strategic planning support, technical writing, information technology support, operations support, logistical support and project and administrative staff support to support the NNCO.&nbsp; The NNCO coordinates the preparation and publication of multiagency planning, budget, and assessment documents, such as the annual NNI supplement to the President's Budget, which also serves as the annual report called for in the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The NNCO organizes meetings of the NSET Subcommittee and its working groups. It also organizes NNI-sponsored workshops and, as appropriate, publishes reports of those workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NNCO coordinates development of information on the NNI and its activities for Congress when requested. The NNCO organizes public input and outreach activities; future examples may include web dialogues, citizens' panels, consensus conferences, and educational events. The NNCO arranges for the triennial review of the NNI by the National Research Council of the National Academies.
<p><br />The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is the U.S. Federal Government's interagency program for coordinating research and development (R&amp;D) and enhancing communication and collaboration in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Twenty-five federal agencies participate in the NNI and individually and cooperatively expedite the discovery, development, and deployment of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology to serve the public good.</p>
<p>The goals of the NNI, as established by the agencies in the 2011 NNI Strategic Plan, are to:&nbsp;advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development program;&nbsp;foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit;&nbsp;develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology; and&nbsp;support responsible development of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The activities of the NNI R&amp;D Program are organized into eight categories, or Program Component Areas (PCAs). The NNI PCAs cut across the interests and activities of the participating agencies and represent areas where achieving the goals of the NNI can be expedited through interagency coordination. The PCAs are:<br /><br />1. Fundamental nanoscale phenomena and processes<br />2. Nanomaterials<br />3. Nanoscale devices and systems<br />4. Instrumentation research, metrology, and standards for nanotechnology<br />5. Nanomanufacturing<br />6. Major research facilities and instrumentation acquisition<br />7. Environment, health, and safety<br />8. Education and societal dimensions<br /><br />The NNI R&amp;D Program is facilitated and coordinated by the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee, which reports through the Committee on Technology to the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council. The purpose of NSET is to implement relevant portions of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-153) and any other Federal statute related to nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&amp;D.</p>
In support of the aforementioned activities,&nbsp;the contractor will be required to&nbsp;provide program and financial management services, technical expertise in facilitation support, strategic planning support, technical writing, information technology support, operations support, logistical support and project and administrative staff support for the NNCO and the NNI R&amp;D Program, as well as in new topics that may arise in response to changing priorities. <br /><br />This requirement is unrestricted.&nbsp; A single contract will be awarded for all required services. NSF anticipates offering a one-year time and materials contract&nbsp;with four one-year options. The solicitation is anticipated to be available on&nbsp;November 9, 2011. All potential offerors should download the solicitation from the following web site: http:\\www.fedbizops.gov. All amendments to the solicitation will also be posted to the web site.

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort. This acquisition has been Set Aside for Small Business. Only small businesses, qualifying under NAICS Code 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services" (gross receipts averaging not more than $25 million annually for the past three years) will be eligible for award
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

<SUBJECT>Responses to questions submitted pertaining to the Prospectus for a Concession Contract to provide Dude Ranch Operations within Grand Teton National Park and Errata #1.
<SOLNBR>CC-GRTE004-12
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>120211
<ARCHDATE>11082012
<CONTACT>Jennifer L. Bonnett Concessions Management Specia 3039692782     Jennifer_bonnett@nps.gov;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) responses to questions submitted pertaining to the Prospectus for a Concession Contract to provide Dude Ranch Operations within Grand Teton National Park.
1)  Under the Business Opportunity section (page 14) of the prospectus - The Service estimates the value of the Turners' possessory interest to be approximately $1,023,197.  The Turners believe this estimate is not correct and significantly undervalues their possessory interest in the concession.  Please specifically identify the method by which the Service calculated the Turners' estimated possessory interest value and a spread sheet showing the Service's estimated value of the Turners' possessory interest in each structure located on the Ranch.
As stated in the Prospectus, the NPS' value for the Existing Concessioner's Possessory Interest is an estimate. The NPS developed its estimate in accordance with Section 13(b) of the Existing Contract, as amended, which sets forth formulas for calculating and depreciating Possessory Interest value. The NPS included in its estimate NPS-approved Capital Improvements made by the Concessioner during the term of the Existing Contract.
2)  Why does the prospectus not recognize that the Turners own the name "Triangle X Ranch" as well as their historic brand?   
The NPS is aware that the Turners have registered the trade name and trademark for "Triangle X Ranch" and the TX2 brand, respectively. For this reason, the Prospectus does not suggest that the name of the ranch will be the same under a new contract, nor does it even mention the trademarked brand.  Further, the Prospectus refers to the "current" Triangle X Ranch only in reference to the area.
3)  Under the Proposed Operating Plan (Exhibit B), Section 5) J-1(c): Please clarify what the Service means by pack-trips and hunting-trips "based from the ranch?" Is the Service suggesting all pack-trips and hunting-trips being conducted entirely on National Forest Lands and currently being charged a franchise fee by the National Forest are also subject to the Park Franchise Fee.
Triangle X Ranch uses NPS-owned facilities and lands to store equipment and supplies used in its wilderness pack trips and hunting trips. Bookings for such trips occur at the ranch and the personnel associated with these trips live there. In addition, hunters scheduled on such trips commonly overnight or stage at the ranch prior to departing. Thus, the use of NPS property to stage such trips indicates these trips are based from the ranch. The language in the contract (Exhibit B: Operating Plan IV. H.1.b ) states that, " [r]evenue earned on pack trips or hunting trips based from the ranch will be reported and appropriate franchise fees will apply." 
4) Is the Service aware a majority of the horseback rides taken from Triangle X Ranch utilize National Forest Service lands and the National Forest permits authorizing horseback riding and other activities are held by individual Turners (incumbent concessioners); and should the Turners not be awarded the new concession contract, the permits will not automatically transfer to new owners?
Yes, the Service is aware that the Existing Concessioner takes horseback rides from the Triangle X Ranch into properties owned by the USFS, and that any business operating on USFS land must have a permit issued by that Agency to do so.


Errata #1 - Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) changes to the Prospectus for a Concession Contract to provide Dude Ranch Operations within Grand Teton National Park.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is seeking potential sources to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Trainings (CNATRA) T-44C (Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) pilot training program. 

The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires simulator support for the following individual pilot training course: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.147D) (https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/1542.147D.pdf).
The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this training, the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating.
 

This training will require a contractor provided T-44C ProLine 21(PL) Flight Training Device (FTD) and contractor maintenance support of the device(s).   Currently, T-44 (Beechcraft King Air C-90) pilot training is provided by CNATRA on an in-house basis through various sources, including a combination of Government provided and contractor provided personnel and equipment.  The Government is in the process of formulating requirements, based on one of the optional solutions listed below, for conducting the simulator portion of training for T-44C ProLine 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) pilots.  The T-44C PL 21 simulator training will require the use of a contractor provided T-44C (Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) FAA equivalent Level 7 flight training device(s) (FAA certification is not required) with a freeze and reset capability and a FAA Level C (or higher) equivalent visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 45-degree vertical field of view (preferably up to 220 x 60 degree FOV) and the capability to simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.
 The optional solutions in order of preference include:

1.)	  Government would provide an appropriate facility at NAS Corpus Christi, TX for the contractor to set up, operate and maintain the contractor provided T-44C FTD(s) (minimally one (1) device with an option to provide up to four (4) T-44C FTDs), using Government provided instructors and T-44 curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.147D).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to use their own contractor provided instructors, in lieu of Government instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

2.)	  Contractor owned/operated training devices would be located at a contractor provided facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area using Government provided instructors and the Government provided T-44 curriculum (i.e.
 leasing of contractor provided and maintained devices).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs in the Corpus Christi, TX area using the contractor provided facility and instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

3.)	  Contractor would provide the training device(s), support personnel, and facilities for Government leasing at the contractors current training facility.  The Government would provide qualified T-44C instructors and curriculum, using the contractor provided T-44C FTDs and facilities.  An alternative option in this category would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs, facilities and contract instructors using the Government provided T-44 curriculum.
  

Contractor will be required to minimally provide one or more T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) Flight Training Device(s), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices, and (if providing Academic/Simulator instructors) any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; along with data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training.  The Government will provide (as required, depending on option); facilities to support one or more (up to four (4)) T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) FTDs, all required course curriculum/syllabi, Government simulator/academic instructors (as required), and any additional Government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of T-44C pilots.
  These T-44C PL 21training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using one or more T-44C PL 21 FTDs.  The FTDs will be required to simulate the performance and functional operation of the T-44C PL 21 aircraft and will be required to minimally meet FAA Level 7 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  The contractor will use either contractor provided facilities and instructors or the Government-furnished facilities and instructors.  Under all optional solutions, the Government provided course syllabi will be used in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors must:  1) have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours; 2) have knowledge of Department of Defense (DOD) rules and regulations governing aircraft operations; and 3) be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.
 

Businesses having the capabilities and facilities, including existing simulators, are invited to submit the following: 1) description of capabilities as they relate to the above requirements; 2) describe ability to provide the required T-44C PL 21 FTD(s) (minimum of one (1) with an option to provide up to four (4) FTDs); 3) specify the contractors  preference of providing training at a contractor or Government provided facility and describe contractors ability to relocate and install a qualified device to a Government facility, as applicable; 4) business size/status (NAICS code for this requirement is 611512, size standard - $25.5M); and, 5) listing of contracts performing similar services (past or present), including references.
  Responses will serve as a basis for the government's decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.  Responses or questions are requested to be sent via email to alan.wright@navy.mil, but can be faxed to 407-380-4742, or mailed to: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division; ATTN: A. Wright - 25341; 12350 Research Pkwy.; Orlando, FL  32826-3275.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the government to procure the requirements described.  There is no solicitation available at this time.     
This announcement adds a file which depicts the cockpit of the aircraft.

<DESC>ITEM UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION MARKING PRODUCTS

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division (NSWC, Corona), is conducting a market survey to obtain information on available Item Unique Identification (IUID) marking products. All interested sources may participate.

The IUID Center at NSWC, Corona has been tasked by the Director of the Administrative/Fiscal Division in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) to conduct a follow-on environmental survivability study of available IUID marking products and to provide technical performance data to the community.

The original study can be found at: www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/docs/IUID_Environmental_Survivability_Testing_Report.pdf.
  The follow-on study will contain many of the tests from the original study.  The follow-on study will expand beyond the scope of the original study to include direct part marking methods.  Additional tests will be performed including UV exposure of printed materials.

Samples are to be provided at no charge. Samples will not be returned to the vendor after testing. Test results will be shared with the IUID community for consideration in their decision making processes. IUID implementation strategies and product selection may be influenced by the results of these environmental survivability studies resulting in the possibility of future contract awards.

Please contact the IUID Center for lists of the material properties that will be tested and an outline of the test plan.
 Sample quantity, data matrix details, and label or data plate size requirements will be provided. The IUID Center contact is Aaron Wiest at 951-273-4819 or at aaron.wiest@navy.mil.

In order to be considered for the testing, all samples must be received by the IUID Center no later than 10 December 2011. All samples shall be sent to:

<DESC>Synopsis Notice is amended to correct the Government Point of Contact Information.  Please direct all questions regarding this synopsis to Elaine Vandiver at 509-527-7221 or Elaine.M.Vandiver@usace.army.mil.<br><br>This is not a solicitation. This is a pre-solicitation notice that Solicitation No. W912EF-12-B-0003 is scheduled to be posted to the FBO website on or about November 23, 2011. The solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an Invitation for Bid. <br><br>Project title: Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom Repair. The work is located at the Lower Granite Lock and Dam located in Garfield County, Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is between $500,000 and $1,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000. <br><br>Summary of Scope of Work<br><br>General: The Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom is a floating structure in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam that was designed to direct floating trash and debris away from the powerhouse turbine intakes. The boom consists of 5 spans held in position by four intermediate floats. Each intermediate float is held in place by two anchors-one on the upstream side and one on the downstream side, with a chain/wire rope/hardware system linking the anchors to the intermediate float.<br><br>Current Conditions: The condition of the Trash Shear Boom Anchorage System is a concern because some existing wire ropes have broken and had to be replaced temporarily with poly ropes tied off to the existing shore anchors. One of the upstream anchor lines that had broken previously was replaced in the winter of 2006-2007. It is anticipated that anchor and anchor line should be in good condition for another 20 to 25 years. This scope of this contract will be to replace the remaining seven anchors/anchor line systems that are still original equipment or are presently tied off to shore anchors. If the trash boom were to come loose from its anchorage, it could end up lodged in either the Spillway Weir surface passage or the turbine intakes.<br><br>Construction Contract: Using government furnished property-10,000 to 18,000 pound stockless anchors, wire rope, chain, and miscellaneous hardware-assemble the anchorage lines and set the anchors in the river bottom, and connect anchorage lines to the existing intermediate floats to hold the trash shear boom in place.<br><br>Tasks for this contract include:<br>1. Using government furnished property, install three upstream and four downstream anchors, anchor lines, and hardware to keep the floating trash shear boom in position in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam. <br>2. Shorten the first span of longitudinal wire rope cable to approximately 10-20 feet.<br>3. Remove existing and install new (GFP or contractor provided?) backstrap.<br>4. Re-install chain from trash shear boom floats to the 2-inch mainline.<br>5. Inspect boat access and replace wire rope cables from the frame to the floats.<br>6. Inspect 2-inch main line on entire trash shear boom.<br><br>The contract activities will require support of a barge mounted crane, a dive tender, and various work boats and/or barges. Shore crews shall assemble the anchorage lines onshore for installation by marine crews. Many of the tasks must be performed or supported by dive crews. Most dives will be in the range from the water surface to depths of 20 feet, but a few deep dives up to 120 foot depths will be required. Construction is restricted to the Snake River in-water work window (December 15, 2011 through March 1, 2012) but the anticipated contract award date will likely not allow the contractor to begin on-site work until late January, so construction will most likely take place in inclement weather. Safety will be a concern with crane lifts of heavy items; icy conditions; work over water; and work in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam upstream of turbine intakes, conventional spillway gates, and the Spillway Weir surface passage.<br><br>Additionally, the contractor will be required to provide a Project Superintendent, Quality Control Manager, and Site Safety and Health Officer. The Site Safety and Health Officer will not be allowed to perform the duties of either the Project Superintendent or the Quality Control Manager. However, one person could perform the duties of both the Project Superintendent and the Quality Control Manager. The person/persons assigned to those positions must meet the following requirements:<br><br>Quality Control Manager-<br>1. A minimum of 5 years experience on similar projects requiring over-water work.<br>2. Completion of the "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" course within the last 5 years.<br><br>Site Safety and Health Officer-<br>1. A minimum of 5 years safety work experience on similar projects. <br>2. Completion of the 30-hour OSHA construction safety class or equivalent within the last 5 years.<br>3. Completion of an average of at least 24 hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5 years.<br>4. Competent person training as needed<br><br>Other information: Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date. The due date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued. A site visit will be offered. The solicitation will include details about the site visit. ACCESS FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS: Security clearance for foreign nationals to attend a site visit requires approximately 4 weeks; therefore, clearance should be requested immediately. To request clearance, please submit the names of all foreign nationals proposed for site visit attendance, along with documentation to verify that he/she was legally admitted into the United States and has authority to work and/or go to school in the US.

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICIATION FOR PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />The purpose of this task order is to do a power analysis of the benefit of increasing the sample size for selected populations in the "Longitudinal Studies of Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators (ICD)" project and produce a report on the rate of appropriate and inappropriate shocks in the selected populations.</p>
<p>This task order is divided into two phases. In Phase one the baseline data will be analyzed to determine whether there are enough patients available at the sites so that the project will have adequate power for the two strata of interest. The contractor shall submit a report on the power of the study, including information on the actual rates of shocks from patients already enrolled.</p>
<p>An optional Phase may be exercised if it is determined that there are enough patients to continue. In the second phase, the contractor shall produce 3 reports on the rate of appropriate and inappropriate shocks in the additional cohort of patients identified in the first part.</p>
<p>IDENTIFICATION OF THE EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY:<br />The task order was issued on a sole-source basis to Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical augmentation of an existing study. The existing task order under the DEcIDE 1 Network entitled "Logitudinal Studies of Implantable Cardiac Defribrillators" has met its proposed precision goal for the estimates in Stratum I, however, due to the characteristics of the patient population at the study sites being different from the original projection, the number of patients in Stratum II and Stratum III are not sufficient to accurately estimate the rates of ICD therapies in these clinical groups. This task order will improve the precision of current parameters' estimates on rates of ICD therapies in the two strata of interest by analyzing data on a greater number of patients. It is therefore most logical to issue this task order as a sole source directly to Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare.</p>
