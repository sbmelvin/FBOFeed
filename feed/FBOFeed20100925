Classification Code:  D - Information Technology Services, Including Telecommunications services

NATIONAL BUSINESS CENTER BACKGROUND:Located within the Department of the Interior, for more than 30 years, the National Business Center (NBC) supports the Offices and Bureaus within the Department, as well as federal agencies outside the Department, as a Shared Service Center.  The NBC provides a diverse, yet integrated set of administrative solutions, and are currently the only federal agency designated by both Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as a Center of Excellence in the financial management and human resources lines of business.  The NBC workforce of dedicated professionals with extensive knowledge of federal business practices, along with the ability to leverage government and commercial best practices, allows the NBC to service a customer base of more than 150 government offices and agencies.
As a Shared Service Center it is the responsibility of NBC to help customers comply with mandates that are released from the OMB. The White House released a memorandum on June 18, 2010, requiring every agency to put together a plan and strategy to comply with monitoring the Do Not Pay (DNP) Databases. NBC requires a tool that will automate this process in an effort to comply with the directive.REQUIRMENT BACKGROUND:On June 18, 2010, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, issued a memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Federal Agencies, entitled, 'Enhancing Payment Accuracy Through a "Do Not Pay List" ' [ http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-memorandum-enhancing-payment-accuracy-through-a-do-not-pay-list ] .    This memorandum outlines several steps over the next 180 days for OMB and Federal Agencies to review current pre-payment and pre-award procedures and ensure a thorough review of available databases with relevant information specific to vendors on their eligibility to receive Federal benefit payments or Federal awards.   By checking these databases before making payments or awards, Federal Agencies can identify ineligible recipients and prevent certain improper payments.  

The five databases Federal Agencies must check to verify payment eligibility addressed in the Presidents' memorandum are:1.	Social Security Administration's Death Master File; 2.	General Services Administration's Excluded Parties List System; 3.	Department of the Treasury's Debt Check Database; 4.	Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert System or Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System; and 5.	Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities.
The databases as well as additional databases designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be referred to as the "Do Not Pay List".  Additionally, the memorandum specifies Federal Agencies to be aware of circumstances when the law requires a payment or award to be made to a recipient listed in the databases. 
The presidents' memorandum indicated his administration began coordination of the five databases in April 2010 by launching the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), which integrates various sources of information on the eligibility of government contractors for award. Additionally, the President indicates the Director of OMB shall provide to the President, within 120 days (approximately end of October, 2010); "a plan for completing integration for the remaining databases, to the extent permitted by law, so that Federal Agencies can access them through a single entry point."
Additionally, by late September 2010, each agency is expected to submit to OMB a plan that includes information on its current pre-payment and pre-award procedures and a list of databases that the agency checks pursuant to those procedures.  Further, by the end of 2010, the Director of the OMB will issue guidance to be developed in consultation with the affected Federal Agencies and taking in to account current agency pre-payment and pre-award practices, on actions Federal Agencies must take to carry out the memo's requirements.   OMBs' guidance will stipulate, that, " the head of each agency is responsible for ensuring an efficient and accurate process for determining whether the information provided on the 'Do Not Pay List' is sufficient to stop a payment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and, if so, whether a payment should be stopped under the circumstances".   OMB's guidance "shall identify best practices and databases that Federal Agencies should utilize to conduct pre-payment checks to ensure that only eligible recipients receive government benefits or payments."  
The "Do Not Pay List" will allow Federal Agencies to utilize technology to access eligibility information in a timely and cost effective manner.
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:We are reviewing the market place for a Commercial, off the shelf, out of the box, continuous controls monitoring product-  an analytical tool that finds and flags potential improper payment transactions before the payments are completed and the money paid.  The software solution must be able to extract and compare data maintained in an Oracle and Momentum Financial databases against the OMB "Do Not Call List" to ensure the databases are current.  Additionally, it should be able to do the same for our Federal Financial System (FFS) and Financial and Business Management System (FBMS).  The Federal Financial System (FFS) is programmed in COBOL and is a Legacy financial system used by the Department of the Interior (DOI).  Developed for the DOI in the eighties by American Management Systems, FFS is still used by the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Reclamation and National Park Service.  It will be phased out over the next few years and will be replaced by FBMS.  The Financial and Business Management System is the cornerstone to the Department of the Interior's future.  It is the key to the department's financial management modernization strategy and meeting future business needs.  The implementation of FBMS will allow the department to realize the benefits of common processes, a common technology platform, integrated real-time data, and improved operational decision-making. FBMS is an SAP application.  SAP stands for "Systems, Applications and Products".   FBMS is a functionality-driven SAP solution designed to incorporate the majority of DOI's financial management functions into one system.  This integrated system will eliminate over 80 DOI and bureau-specific systems and enable the alignment of a business management system with the DOI's strategy of modernization, integration, accountability, and customer value.  
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:The solution will support three primary areas:1)	Acquisition and Preparation of Data2)	Analysis of Data3)	Resolution of Exceptions and Reporting of Results

These services include management and operation of CDC clinics, provision of preventive and health promotion programs, occupational health surveillance programs, employee counseling services, and work-site health promotion activities primarily for employees in the Atlanta area. While the majority of CDC clinic patient visits are for immunizations, work-related injury and illness care, and compliance exams in support of worker protection programs, a large number of services are provided to prepare deployable teams of public health emergency responders. The Clinics have prepared teams for the domestic and international response to infectious disease outbreaks, hurricane response, as well as preparedness.</p>
<p>This contract provides for occupational health on critical worker and environmental protections related to CDC's laboratory work, field investigations, control of emerging infections, bioterrorism response and preparedness, pandemic control efforts, and similar activities. The contract is critical to assure CDC's successful completion of its mission of urgent public health intervention as well as for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>At this time the current contractor is the sole organization/provider that can deliver the specific services for such a limited time span to meet the health and safety needs related to CDC's critical public health mission.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, "when supplies or services are available from only one responsible source, full and open competition need not be provided for." As stated above, CSC is the only organization that can provide the deliverables of the project for the period required.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION(JOFOC)Over $100,000 (FAR 6.303-2)

1.	 Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:
National Park Service(NPS)/WASO-WCP
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Operational Leadership ProgramThe NPS requires the development and production of course materials for a range of risk management training, and the development of a complimentary facilitator instructor course.  Because close to 3,000 NPS employees have been trained on a specific risk management curriculum, which is copyrighted, a sole source contract shall be issued to California Training Institute (CTI), 1831 Quail Court, Saint Helena, CA 94574.3.	 A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:The NPS requires the development of the following courses, including curriculum and materials, using the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Team Coordination Training (TCT) as the foundation."	NPS All-Employee Operational Leadership Basic/Content Course 16 Hour Course"	NPS Operational Leadership Leader Course 8 Hour Course"	Orientation to Operational Leadership 2 Hour Course"	Operational Leadership (Basic) Facilitator Training & Skill Development Course (Train the Trainer):  16 Hour Course"	In addition to developing the above courses, the NPS requires that the contractor provide approximately 7, 16 hour training sessions on the Operational Leadership (Basic) Facilitator Training & Skill Development Course (Train the Trainer)"	In addition, in the four option years, the NPS may require that the contractor provide reviews and updates of the curriculum and materials.  This will require approximately 80 hours of effort in each option year.    Estimated Value of the Procurement:  $266,605
4.	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:
USC 2304 - FAR 6.302-1 (a)(iii) - Only One Responsible Source
5.	A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
As early as 2004, NPS rangers began searching for programs/mechanisms to address behaviors that were associated with the serious injury and death of NPS employees engaged in law enforcement and emergency response.  Repeated attempts over the history of the NPS to improve the safety and health of its employees were not proven effective in addressing the fundamental reason employees are injured - unsafe behavior and practices. As a result of this search, only one program was found to uniquely address behavior.  The Team Coordination Training (the U.S. Coast Guard version of Operational Risk Management(ORM)) was evaluated and selected as the best mechanism for NPS adaption of risk management principles and tools for the field.  While other military ORM versions existed i.e. USAF, and were familiar to the ranger workforce, the USCG version provided a curriculum and tools most closely identified to NPS ranger needs and best suited for NPS application.
While information on USCG Team Coordination Training was available on the internet, NPS rangers met with and received teaching materials, background information, stories of success, and offers of assistance from the USCG in order to export the program to the NPS.  USCG indicated that the program was property of the Coast Guard and NPS was free to use it in any way we wanted.
Initially, at least 21 "training courses" were piloted to NPS managers and work groups, including Regional Directorates and the Safety Leadership Council, in order to audition the merits of Team Coordination Training.  Unanimous support from senior staff provided validation that TCT was the best ORM course to satisfy ranger workforce needs.  Rangers in the Pacific West Region renamed the USCG TCT to "Operational Leadership" and began a significant push to adopt the USCG content into NPS content. 
While there are other ORM models that could be used, since they all basically use the same fundamental principles of risk management, they are very different in their application, and that is a fundamental difference.  The Operational Leadership model is unique and the NPS has embraced, and invested in, that unique approach. The NPS has invested significant resources to train employees as collateral-duty Operational Leadership instructors. To date, almost 3,000 employees have been trained on Operational Leadership with the core information provided by the USCG and a cadre of 36 active NPS employees has been established to instruct on Operational Leadership principles, tools, and techniques specific to the program. 
As a result of this training ,the application of tools and techniques, such as the Green Amber Red(GAR) model of Operational Leadership into various levels of the NPS organization including the field level, supervisory levels, and management levels along with its emphasis on applying the content appropriately at those various levels distinguishes Operational Leadership from others.  A primary strength that has made the underlying content come alive is the organization and presentation of the content into various chapters of learning including Leadership, Stress and Performance, Situational Awareness, etc. and the way that it incorporates an adult learning model into a system of "facilitating" and instructing the content. Other programs are geared towards the field practitioner level and do not adequately bring the concepts to the programmatic level. Other programs focus almost entirely on the activity and the immediate environment, but do not place the activity as well into the underlying organizational and programmatic context, which the GAR model does. Operational Leadership is "grass-roots" and employee-based, which in the world of a field ranger, is crucial for buy-in and success. 
Operational Leadership has become part of the NPS vocabulary The Safety Leadership Council adopted Operational Leadership as 1 of 4 action items to integrate safety into NPS Mission, work ethic, and behavior. Operational Leadership is the one behavior-based program to combine with our traditional safety programs in order to enhance our culture of safety and reduce NPS accident, injury and fatality rates. Operational Leadership is seen and accepted as the model that will eventually result in a shift in the way all employees recognize and evaluate risk. Employees champion the program across the field including collateral-duty instructors, regional operational leadership coordinators, and hundreds who practice the principles and tools every day. GAR models are actively used to assess team and park operations and programs. Operational Leadership concepts are being interwoven into other NPS programs especially Wildland Fire. Operational Leadership sessions are now a part of NPS Fundamentals Training, and becoming incorporated into the Superintendents Academy, the Facility Manager Development Program, Supervisory training, and U.S. Park Police operations. A change now - just when the program is becoming ingrained in our workforce and ready to bloom - would erase progress from the past six years. 
In December 2009, in an attempt to formalize the Operational Leadership materials/courses, a solicitation was issued to have contractors utilize the TCT program from the USCG as a starting point and then revise it to be more NPS specific.  However, prior to award of the resultant contract, CTI asserted that the information in the TCT guide was not the property of the USCG to utilize as previously represented, and that using these guides by any other contractor would be copyright infringement.  Therefore, since CTI has the copyright on the USCG TCT materials, and an extensive amount of money and resources have already been expended to train NPS employees on these principles, CTI is the Only Responsible Source IAW FAR 6.302-1.  
6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:
As discussed previously, a solicitation was issued to have contractors utilize the TCT program from the USCG as a starting point and then revise it to be more NPS specific.  However, prior to award of the resultant contract, CTI asserted that the information in the TCT guide was not the property of the USCG to utilize as previously represented, and that using these guides by any other contractor would be copyright infringement.  A notice stating our intent to award a sole source contract to CTI shall be posted in accordance with FAR Part 5.2.
7.	A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable:
Price analysis shall be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.4 prior to award of any contract to CTI in order to determine the cost of the contract fair and reasonable to the government.
8.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:
As discussed previously, there are other ORM models provided by other contractors that use the same fundamental principles of risk management.  However, they are very different in their application, and that is a fundamental difference.  The Operational Leadership model contained in the USCG TCT materials is unique, has been adopted by the NPS for numerous years, and CTI has the copyright to those materials.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:NONE10.	 A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the        Acquisition:
The following contractors submitted proposals in response to Solicitation N2430100003, which was issued based on the understanding NPS could utilize the USCG TCT materials as the basis for a competitive solicitation:
	Soaring Eagle Enterprises	PO Box 35707 	Las Vegas, NV 89133-5707
	California Training Institute	1831 Quail Court	Saint Helena, CA 94574
	Strategos Training	1330 Orange Ave	Coronado, CA 92118
	DB Associates of Wisconsin, LLC	5702 Glenway Street	McFarland, WI 53558

11.	 A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:
The NPS plans to obtain unlimited data rights from CTI for the deliverables in the sole source contract.  Therefore any further modifications of the course materials will be able to be done via competitive contract action or via NPS personnel.  However, if the cost of unlimited data rights is cost prohibitive, then the NPS may negotiate other data rights.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43.  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  The solicitation number is Q9504100024, and is issued as a Request for Quotation.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns, NAICS 113310, Logging, with a small business size standard of fewer than 500 employees.   The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a single firm-fixed price contract to the responsive, responsible offeror that represents the best value and can best satisfy the objectives and requirements of this solicitation, in a manner most advantageous to the Government.   The Government will consider past performance in determining responsibility.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
DESCRIPTION:  The National Park Service, Olympic National Park, has a requirement to purchase 200 limbed logs as specified below.  The contract will include supply, hauling, delivery, off-loading, dunnage, and stacking/staging.  Multiple deliveries expected during October 2010, as detailed below.  
SPECIFICATIONS:  (1)  GENERAL LOG CONDITIONS:  Logs shall have limbs removed, consist of no more than 5% rotten or "punky" wood, and must not be split/splintered.  (2)  SOURCE:  Logs shall be supplied from Clallam and/or Jefferson Counties, Washington.   Offerors shall provide a written description of the location from where the logs will be obtained.  This can either be in the form of a latitude/longitude coordinate, a legal description (township, range, section) or other description that allows specific location information.  In addition, offerors shall also provide driving instructions to the site(s).   (3)  SPECIES:  The logs may be any conifer species native to the Northern Olympic Peninsula, but no more than 10% of logs to be Hemlock (Tsuga sp.).  NPS intent is to avoid receiving mostly Hemlock logs in each delivered load.  The NPS will visually inspect by random sampling for each load, upon delivery.  (4)  DIAMETER:  Minimum twelve 12 inches.  Maximum 16 inches. NPS will visually inspect each load upon delivery, and measure diameter of logs by random sampling. The diameter range applies to either end of the log, i.e., both the butt end and the small end must be between 12 inches and 16 inches in diameter, with minimal taper. Inspection will include random measurements at either end of the logs.(5)  LENGTH:  Minimum 16 feet.  Maximum 20 feet.  NPS will visually inspect each load upon delivery, and measure length of logs by random sampling. (6)  MOISTURE:  Maximum moisture content of 55% wet basis (MCw).  NPS intent is to avoid receiving water-saturated logs that cannot be used.  The NPS will visually inspect each load upon delivery, and take the physical measurement for moisture content by random sampling using an electronic wood moisture meter.    
PRIC SCHEDULE:(1)  LIMBED LOGS:  200 each @ $__________ per log = $____________.   (2)  DELIVERY (Includes hauling, off-loading, dunnage, piling/staging):   (a)  Quantity for each load/trip ______  @ $________ per load/trip = $__________.  (b)  Provide proposed first and final delivery dates in October 2010 ________________________.
INSPECTION/ACCEPTANCE:  (1) INSPECTION PRIOR TO AWARD.  Prior to award, NPS will conduct site visits to ensure each site is acceptable for the type and level of exotic invasive plant species per NPS standardized checklist.  The primary species of concern are:  Scot's Broom, Canda Thistle, Herb Robert, Fox Glove, St. John's Wort, and Tansy Ragwort.  (2)  INSPECTION AFTER AWARD.  Each load delivered will be inspected at time of delivery by NPS.  NPS will inspect by methods of visual inspection, and random sampling for taking actual measurements, such as diameter, length, moisture content, and species.  If, during inspection, NPS finds unacceptable logs, those logs shall be rejected.  The contractor shall be responsible for rejected logs and re-delivery at its own expense within the contract delivery schedule.
DELIVERY:  (1)  Deliveries shall be made during October 2010.  The logs will ultimately be hauled by helicopter into the park's backcountry, and the helicopter to be scheduled as soon as possible upon final delivery of logs.  Final delivery shall be received, inspected, and accepted no later than October 28, 2010.  (2)  Logs must be loaded where harvested.  Logs shall not be decked or stockpiled elsewhere from their harvest site in an effort to reduce potential vectors for weed introduction.  The concern of NPS is to avoid having logs harvested from a weed-free area, and then stored in a weedy area prior to delivery.  (3)  The DELIVERY LOCATION will be designated, and is within the Elwha River Valley, Olympic National Park.  Turn off of Highway 101 onto Olympic Hot Springs road.  The furthest delivery site is 5.5 miles from the turn-off (flat site adjacent to Glines Canyon Dam).  The closest delivery site is 2.5 miles from the turn-off (Sweet's Field).  (4)  Unload and neatly place logs on dunnage so that straps can be put around logs for slinging.  (5)  Each truckload to be weighed and staged separately with load weight indicated on staged piles.  The "load weight" is defined as the weight of the logs only.  There is no maximum or minimum size for the loads or piles, other than each truckload should be offloaded into a discrete pile that is marked with the weight.  This will enable the NPS to determine an average weight of the logs in the pile, which is necessary for calculating helicopter loads.

The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension.	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). 	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT- WAGON RESTORATION PROJECT:<BR><BR>1.  INTRODUCTION.<BR>	a.  GENERAL.  The contractor shall perform the tasks listed in accordance with terms and conditions established in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Performance will be in support of Fort Sill National Historic Landmark, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.<BR>	b.  PURPOSE.  This Performance Work Statement (PWS) defines the tasks a licensed Contractor will be required to perform.  The contractor shall restore five (5) historical wagons.<BR>	c.  BACKGROUND.  The Wagons are an educational exhibit program of the early Fort Sill Quartermaster. The wheels shall be restored to preserve the integrity of the exhibited piece. Fort Sill National Historic Landmark Museum are required to train and educate Soldiers and the public on the history of Fort Sill.<BR>2. NATURE AND SCOPE OF WORK.<BR>	a.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE.  To be determined based on location of awarded Contractor.<BR>	b.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<BR>	(1) Task 1.  The scope of this project involves the restoration of one Talley Ho wagon (No. SILL 94.051.001) in the museum collections.  <BR>	(2) Task 2.  The scope of this project involves the restoration of one Ice Wagon (No. SILL 90.179.001) in the museum collections.  <BR>	(3) Task 3.  The scope of this project involves the restoration of one Roof Break Wagon (No. SILL 89.106.003) in the museum collections.  <BR>	(4) Task 4.  The scope of this project involves the restoration of one Apache Hay Wagon (No. SILL 89.113.001) in the museum collections.  <BR>	(5) Task 5.  The scope of this project involves the restoration of one Mountain Spring Wagon (No. SILL 89.110.003) in the museum collections.  <BR>Unless otherwise directed, the Contractor is required to repair or replace deteriorated wood with historically appropriate materials of the same size and thickness, and replace other manufactured parts and materials with historically accurate cloth, leather or metal.  Unless identified as historically correct, all plywood components shall be replaced with solid wood of the correct dimensions and proportions.  All metal hardware shall be cleaned, straightened, repaired or otherwise replaced with appropriate materials (hand-forged, cast, machined, cut or stamped) to match the original specifications or standards. All metal hardware (i.e. rub iron, rails, handles, hooks, catches, hinges, etc.) that is missing  shall be made with appropriate materials (hand-forged, cast, machined, cut or stamped) to match the original specifications or standards and must be compatible with the manufacturing date. Replace all cross tip screws with flat tip screws. Unless identified as historically correct, all hex head nuts and bolts shall be replaced with square nuts and bolts.<BR>Wheels with missing or incomplete pieces such as metal and/or rubber tires, spokes, felloes, hubs, hub bands or other components, including associated hardware, shall be produced for an accurate and finished product.  All wheel components shall be inspected and repaired as necessary with appropriate materials.<BR>Remove and replace seat pads and cushions with correctly designed pads and cushions, using appropriate specification or standard materials of period style, or fabric consistent with the era of the manufacture date.<BR>All wood or metal surfaces shall be prepared, coated with a good quality primer, and painted to original standards, to include appropriate markings.  If an original painted surface is identified for preservation, it shall not be painted or repaired except as determined by the Museum.  <BR><BR>There are no set standards for determining when deterorated wood should be replaced  50%, 75%, etc.).  This is a judgment call based on consultations with the museum curator.  Overall, the intent is to repair and stabilize the vehicles which includes repair or replace bad or inappropriate wood as needed.  This takes experience and could not be accomplished by someone who did not have the necessary experience of working with historical wagons. Restoration takes into consideration the current integrity of the<BR>wood/hardware, to preserve and maintain as much of the original as possible but acknowledging that repair and/or replacement may be necessary to maintain the integrity and historical appearance. This is not about just rebuilding wagons.<BR><BR>The goal of this project is to attain a historical use appearance where the wagon depending on its original function does not look like a new wagon, but one that has been used for its intended purpose. A hay wagon should not look new with a new paint job, but like a hay wagon still in use today.  The ice wagon should also look like an ice wagon still being used today. <BR><BR>There are different levels of treatment for each of the wagons.  For example: the Apache hay wagon primarily has a wheel problem.  Wheels may need to be rebuilt using the original metal or other stable wooden components.  The overall wagon needs to be thoroughly cleaned with any old non-historic and loose paint removed.  The wood should be treated with linseed oil mixed with stains to complement the early appearance of the<BR>wagon as it was being used.  Any bent iron should be straightened out. Inappropriate hardware (Phillips head screws, hex nuts, etc) replaced. Undercarriage should be thoroughly cleaned and stabilized before surface treatment is done.<BR><BR>The Ice wagon needs wheel work; iron corner braces on each side of the rear need to be straightened out; one board at the top right side is broken and should be replaced; some modern bolts & nuts replaced; and missing bolts/nuts replaced.  The undercarriage cleaned and stabilized before surface treatment.  There is no original paint and any loose paint can be removed, sanded, etc.  New surface treatment involves low luster paint to<BR>match the undercarriage can be applied in conjunction with linseed oil treatments.  A canvas cover should be provided for this wagon in accordance with the original appearance of ice wagons of the day. <BR><BR>The brake wagon has heavy paint coatings that are separating and flaking. There is no original paint on this wagon. The current paint should be removed and a new coating applied in conjunction with linseed oil and stains.  The surface of this wagon should be treated with a combination of satin paint, stains and oil to give it a slightly used historic appearance. Undercarriage cleaned and painted the same.  Wheels checked thoroughly for<BR>stability.  Rubber tires that are damaged or missing should be replaced. Bent iron railings straightened. Upholstery replaced with appropriate materials.<BR><BR>The Mountain Wagon has multiple coats of paint and it is unclear if original paint exists.  A careful removal or cleaning needs to be conducted to preserve any original paint beneath the top surface.  This wagon should have the appearance of a working wagon used to transport officers around the post, etc.  The OD paint is probably the original color.  Wheels checked for stability (repair small deteroration but replace major areas that threaten stability).  Bent iron railings should be straightened. <BR><BR>Tally Ho wagon needs major work.  Plywood panels should be replaced with appropriate pine boards, etc.  Modern hardware replaced to meet previously cited standards.

Undercarriages should be examined closely to determine amount of cleaning, removal or disassembly from beds to ensure stability and maintain integrity.

<DESC>Q &amp; A's<br />Who supplies the paper, plastic bags and soap? The custodial contractor furnishes these items.<br />What is the square footage of the garages? 14,120<br />What is the total square footage of terrazzo requiring polishing and grinding? 68,354<br />What is the total square footage of carpet? 120,883<br />Is there storage in the garage for a garage sweeper or do we need to store offsite? This depends on the size of the machine. We would most likely have no problem with finding a corner somewhere as long as the machine is not the size of a full scale forklift.
<p>I would like to find out the break down of Terrazzo floor area by each level on FTC building.</p>
<p>The current total area of terrazzo is 68,354 square feet - this total includes rest rooms. A floor by floor breakdown is not available at this time, however it may be helpful to note that the 6th &amp; 7th floors have approximately half the area of terrazzo of the other floors. The basement level and 8th floor (attic) have none.</p>
<p><br />1. Trash Removal (of dumpster contents) via trash truck is to occur after 11pm and before 7am. Likewise the removal of debris from the debris room as well as emptying of women's sanitary containers is to occur after 11pm and before 7am. The emptying of office trash cans is to occur during the regular cleaning hours for the areas in question. For example: Room 719 is on routine night time cleaning - the trash cans in that room are also emptied during the same time frame. Also, the ladies restrooms are cleaned during the routine night time cleaning - this is unrelated to the time that the sanitary containers are emptied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The prime contractor is currently using a sub-contractor for emptying of the dumpster and removal of bulk debris. The sub was Eastern Trans Waste.</p>

The reagents to be purchased are 9 kit-05 233 526 001<br />GS Titanium Sequencing Kit  XLR70; 9 kit-05 233 682 001<br />GS Titanium PicoTiter Plate Kit, 70x75; 9 kit-05 233 640 001 GS FLX Titanium SV emPCR Kit Lib-L*; 1 kit-05 233 674 001 GS Titanium emPCR Filters SV, 64 pc; 1 kit-05 608 228 001 GS Rapid Library Prep Kit; 1 kit-05 619 211 001<br />GS Rapid Library MID adapters Kit; 1 kit-05 233 747 001<br />GS Titanium General Library Prep Kit
<p>We need reagents and supplies to support running a Genome Sequencer FLX system housed at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center. The Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (GS FLX) is a DNA sequencer designed and built by 454 Life Sciences and distributed by Roche Applied Science. The technology for this system is based on enrichment of fragmented DNA followed by clonal amplification and pyrosequencing. The sequencer can generate up to 500 million bases per 7.5 hour run, achieve reads averaging 350 to 450 bases, attain over 1,000,000 reads per run, generate single-read accuracy that is greater than 99%, and achieve consensus accuracy greater than 99.99%. Reagents required to run this system include GS Titanium compatible library preparation kits for linker modified single stranded DNA, SV emulsion based PCR kits for titration of the library fragments for the sequencing reaction, LV emulsion based PCR kits for preparative reactions of bead-linked DNA fragments for sequencing, Titanium chemistry sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits which provide the surface for sequencing of the DNA fragments.<br />Roche is the sole supplier and distributor of the GS FLX instrument. The GS titanium library preparation reagents, emulsion based PCR kits, sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits are only available through Roche. The GS FLX warranty is conditional that customers agree to use the instrument in strict accordance with Roche operating instructions, including Roche sole source specifications regarding reagent kits. The FLX sequencer makes use of very specialized reagents only available from Roche at the present time in a form suitable for use on the instrument.</p>
