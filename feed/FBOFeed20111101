Small Business Set-Aside TBD
This Request for Information (RFI) is not a solicitation. This RFI is being issued to conduct market research for information and planning purposes for a source for design, development, and subsequent interim contractor support (ICS) of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) Program's Close Air Support System (CASS) Software (v) 1.4.5.  TACP CASS Software is a unified, proven, fielded, warfighting capability that provides critical enhancements that can be used to communicate with various types of platforms over various combat radio networks. TACP units communicate with other ground units and with aircraft via direct radio contact using Variable Message Format (VMF), Air Force Application Program Development (AFAPD), or Marine Tactical Standard (MTS) and via the Link-16 network or the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) network. The same TACP CASS software code is hosted on a variety of computers at various US Army command echelons, thus providing interope! rability of CAS communications across the battlespace and across the many Army and Air Force systems that support live fire operations.  No single interface provides more than a small fraction of the software's capability.  Multimax was awarded a contract in 2002 for the development of the CASS software (ANZUS was a key subcontractor and the actual developers of the CASS code).  ANZUS was then acquired by Rockwell Collins in 2004, and Rockwell Collins has continuously developed and maintained successive software versions. The integrated capability is thoroughly embedded in all communities supporting CAS operation, including operations, training, security and test.  While TACP CASS software does NOT comprise an air space management capability, it takes inputs from many systems that provide Situational Awareness (SA).
The TACP-M Program is working towards satisfying current software requirements with the fielding of each TACP CASS increment.  Currently, TACP CASS Software version (v) 1.4.2, fielded and operational, resides on the Dismounted systems and also on the Air Support Operations Center Gateway (ASOC GW).  TACP CASS (v) 1.4.3 was discontinued and never fielded.  TACP CASS (v) 1.4.4 is in development and is expected to enter Government test in April, 2012, and be fielded in September 2012, when it is anticipated that the final software source code and documentation can be made available for industry review.  TACP-M is currently expecting to fulfill current software requirements with the fielding of TACP CASS Software (v) 1.4.5 in January, 2015, the subject of this RFI  
The Department of the Air Force, HQ ESC/HNAC TACP Modernization Program, is conducting market research to solicit feedback from industry for providing the following design, development, and ICS services and/or solutions to support TACP CASS Software. This RFI seeks to obtain information from interested parties on developing TACP CASS increment (v) 1.4.5 to satisfy operational requirements and provide ICS for TACP CASS software once it has been fielded. The objectives of this RFI are to understand the potential sources with the necessary skills and experience to design, develop, test, integrate, and field new CASS software build (v) 1.4.5 as well as to provide 24-hour, year-round technical support of all operational CASS software once (v) 1.4.5 has been fielded.   It is anticipated that qualified respondents will present capabilities for assimilating and building upon CASS software build (v) 1.4.4, even though documentation of that build, comprising 800,000 logical lines of s! oftware code, is known to be incomplete, and to demonstrate the ability substantially to reuse and/or reverse engineer existing software of similar complexity within severe performance, cost and schedule constraints.  All (v) 1.4.4 capabilities will be rolled into (v) 1.4.5, and the support of all aggregated capabilities will be required upon the fielding of (v) 1.4.5.
TACP CASS Software must comply with the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (KPPs). TACP CASS Software must fully support execution of joint operational activities identified in the applicable joint and system integrated architectures and the system must satisfy the technical requirements for transition to Net-Centric military operations. We are seeking companies that have supported the Global Information Grid (GIG) architecture, including the Defense Information Infrastructure-Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) and all DoD security and enterprise architecture policies (DoDAF, DIACAP).  We are seeking companies that can offer database management specialists/integrators capable of providing expert command and control design, development, services, and support. 
Requirements:
The TACP CASS Software (v) 1.4.5 requires development of major enhancements to existing code, including:
1.	Interface with Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS).2.	Design and develop NewLite, a hand-held or wearable configuration with a new user interface for dismounted TACPs.  This shall incorporate all Joint Tactical Air Strike Request (JTASR) and 9-line communication functionality currently deployed in TACP CASS software in its Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and vehicular configurations.3.	Continue development of experimental software designed to communicate with F-35 aircraft.4.	Develop communication protocols with three designated UK and German coalition aircraft.5.	Develop US Army communications protocols and battlefield geometries, including Call for Fires (CFF), e.g., Gun Target Line (GTL), with calculated Maximum Ordinate (MAX ORD)  for all attacking unit-target pairs.6.	Develop and/or enhance Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) software.7.	Develop software for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) Including Integration and Improvement of experimental software designed to communicate with the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II.8.	Develop an interface to the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS).9.	Develop a variety of additional software capabilities outlined in signed, funded AF Forms 1067, as Air Combat Command directs.
The TACP CASS Software Program, in addition to developing the above capabilities in (v) 1.4.5, needs to support DACAS interoperability with deployed or deploying/ ground forces, existing CAS aircraft and Operational Flight Programs (OFPs), airspace Command and Control (C2), networking, messaging, and protocol standards, blue force tracking systems, battlefield managers, communications equipment, and needed TACP system hardware improvements or changes because of obsolescence.

<DESC>TARDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W56HZV-05-R-BAA1<br>Topic #25<br>U.S. Army Contracting Command - Warren<br><br>Background: Potable water and gray water (wastewater that does not contain body or food wastes, i.e., from showers and washing machines.) account for a substantial percentage of the logistics support convoys in current Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating gray water and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to bring in potable water and remove gray water. Water logistics plays an increasing role at the tactical edge, where small FOBs are regularly distributed throughout remote regions.<br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for water recycle/reuse technology that will, at a minimum, improve the water efficiency at Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOBs during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies.<br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through <br>2013 is $1.75M. The estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project is $560,000 in Fiscal Year 2012 and $1,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2013. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions.<br><br>Multiple Awards: The Government anticipates awarding up to two (2) contracts as a result of this topic.<br><br>Potential offerors should access the full topic description, terms and conditions, and proposal submission instructions by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm <br><br>Proposals that reflect a partial solution to the technical objective and description are not acceptable. The government will consider only those proposed projects that address all elements of the objective and description.<br><br>Proposals will be accepted 01 December 2011 through 09 January 2012. Proposals must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 09 January 2012 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), accessible at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm.

<DESC>TARDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W56HZV-05-R-BAA1<br>Topic #26<br>U.S. Army Contracting Command - Warren<br><br><br>Background: The current and future demands of a highly mobile, resource limited, Forward Operating Base (FOB) Camp call for new/advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment. The Government must continue to improve and optimize its water management to meet mission requirements. The need for reductions in the water supply burden of FOB operations and the safe discharge of wastewater require innovative technologies with the capability to treat gray (i.e., shower water reuse system concentrate) and black water (i.e., kitchen and toilet) so that it can be discharged into the environment, thus eliminating the need for waste hauling.<br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for a low-waste generation, energy efficient, gray and black wastewater treatment system that can, at a minimum, be used to support a Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOB during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies.<br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through <br>2013 is $1.75M.

<DESC>In a collaborative effort, the Army Research Office (ARO) will be working with the DoD High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL-JTO) to execute the FY2012 High Energy Laser Multidisciplinary Research Initiative (MRI) Program.  This program is executed under the policy and guidance of the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Science and Technology (DUSD (S&T)) and will be administered by the US Army Research Office, Durham, NC and the High Energy Lasers-Joint Technology Office (HEL-JTO), Albuquerque, NM.  This program is authorized by Public Law No. 106-398 Sections 241-250, High Energy Laser Programs, as established by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.  <br><br>Through this announcement, the DoD intends to award approximately $6-7M for FY 2012, subject to the availability of funds.  Approximately twelve to fifteen (12-15) awards are anticipated.  It is projected that awards will be made in the form of grants.  However, awards may be made in the form of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts.  The estimated value of each award is approximately $500K per year for three (3) years with an additional two (2) year option period.  <br><br>The primary focus of the FY2012 HEL MRI is to enhance the capabilities of US institutions of higher education to perform fundamental science and engineering research related to lasers, optics, laser interaction physics, and advanced concepts for national defense applications.  Awards will be made to degree-granting US institutions of higher education.  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government laboratories are not eligible for awards under this announcement, although they may participate as subawardees.  Entities other than US institutions of higher education, to include non-profit organizations, not-for-profit organizations, private industry concerns, and foreign universities/research institutions are not eligible for awards under this announcement, although they may participate as subawardees.  Domestic institutions of higher education/universities are to be the primary awardees and must perform at least 60% of the proposed research effort (universities participating as first tier subawardees count within the 60% requirement threshold).  Industrial and non-profit/not-for-profit partners may not contribute more than 40% of the total effort or receive more than 40% of awarded funds.  Only proposals submitted directly by domestic institutions of higher education/universities (to include US Military Academies) will be considered for award.  United States Military Academies are eligible as prime awardees or subawardees under this announcement.  <br>

<p>Title: Mastication/Thinning/Piling</p>
<p>Location: R-3 SW Northern Zone - Santa Fe National Forest</p>
<p>Description of Work:</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation is for mechanical fuels treatment/mastication/thinning and piling. One contract shall be awarded for all activities. The treatment area is ~550 acres on the Jemez Ranger District of the Santa Fe National Forest in the State of New Mexico. The treatments consist of creating a low fuel profile area on the perimeter of a prescribed fire (Rx) area. Reducing the fuels on the perimeter of the Rx burn will reduce the probability of an escaped Rx fire and increase the safety of personnel implementing the burn. The project area's topography is steep and broken (majority of the area is over 30% slope) making for limited access for mastication. Road access is good with none of the area more than a quarter mile from a road. Roads define the project area boundary. High clearance vehicles are recommended. Stand conditions are variable. Some of the stands have been pre-commercially thinned. There are heavily logged stands converted to brush fields. Some of the area to the east of the project burned in the Las Conchas wildfire in 2011 and some thinning was done along Forest Road 266 during the fire for fire line preparation. Snags are abundant. <br /><br />The project calls for cutting all trees less than 10 inches diameter breast height (DBH) and taller than 3 feet in areas not accessible for mastication/grinding (i.e. slopes greater than 40%, areas with excessive rock outcroppings, or broken topography). Cut material less than 5 inches in diameter (tops, limbs, and small trees) shall be piled, and cut material larger than 5 inches in diameter shall be bucked so that the bucked piece is in contact with the ground in at least three places. Brush species (oak, locust) do not have to be treated in areas that are not accessible for mastication. On ground accessible for mastication trees less than 10 inches DBH and brush shall be masticated on site. What is machine accessible ground shall be determined by the COR in consultation with the contractor. A reasonable attempt shall be made by the contractor to maximize the number of acres masticated. Mastication is the preferred treatment method. Mastication shall be completed for the project area before beginning the cutting and piling.</p>
<p>Estimated Start Date: 04-15-12</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Defense (DoD) solicits proposals for the development of innovative capabilities to pre-detonate IEDs employed against U.S. or coalition forces anywhere in the world, but especially in Afghanistan. JIEDDO is seeking mounted or dismounted capabilities that can be rapidly developed, demonstrated, and deployed within 6 to 24 months from award. However, JIEDDO is willing to entertain less mature systems with a potentially high payoff. Proposals must address the requirements stated in Section III of the BAA, which are summarized below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-detonation capabilities are those which will initiate or trigger an IED causing it to detonate at a safe stand-off distance. Safe stand-off is defined as a sufficient distance to protect both the operator and the equipment from the explosive force of the IED. The pre-detonation capabilities must function without any prior knowledge of the location of the IED, or whether an IED is present in the area. The pre-detonation capabilities must trigger the IED; <strong>JIEDDO will not accept proposals that aim at disabling the IED by affecting the electronics or other neutralization techniques. This solicitation is for general pre-detonation capabilities, i.e., capabilities that target a broad range of IEDs independent of their triggering mechanisms.</strong> Because of the potentially high payoff of this capability, JIEDDO is willing to accept less mature concepts for consideration than it normally funds. However, all proposals must provide sufficient technical detail for the evaluation panel to understand the theory, and have confidence that the proposer can successfully develop it. Performance claims substantiated by analytical, experimental or modeling &amp; simulation data provide a higher level of confidence. At a minimum, proposals should provide theoretical calculations or scientific basis for their technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">See attached BAA document for full description of requirements. <br /></span></strong>All proposals must be submitted to the JIEDDO BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS) website at https://bids.acqcenter.com/JIEDDO.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for a regulatory management center that will provide Regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance support to DAIT Office of Regulatory Affairs for trials conducted under all Networks funded by DAIT NIAID as well as for trials conducted by individual Principal Investigator's funded by DAIT through a non-Network Mechanism. The scope of this contract will cover all trials whether conducted under Health Authority Application or not.
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy,<br />Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. This includes support for clinical research programs and individual research projects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.</p>

In addition, all DAIT-supported clinical trials, including those conducted under FDA regulation, as well as IND/IDE-exempt studies and trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines: E2A Clinical Safety Data Management and E6 Good Clinical Practices (GCP), as well as country-specific regulatory regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish a Division-wide Regulatory Management Center to: (1) centralize all regulatory support services for DAIT-funded clinical research programs, currently carried out under multiple grants and contracts, into a single contract dedicated to regulatory affairs; (2) provide regulatory support services for individual clinical trial projects conducted under investigator-initiated cooperative agreement grants within a centralized contract; and (3) provide regulatory support services for future DAIT-supported clinical research programs and individual projects.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall serve as the DAIT Regulatory Management Center (RMC) with responsibility for carrying out a broad range of technical and administrative regulatory support functions for the Division's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), and for working with other DAIT scientific/clinical staff responsible for the conduct and oversight of clinical trials, Principal Investigators (PIs) and other senior staff of DAIT-supported clinical research programs and their clinical sites, investigators conducting individual clinical trial projects, and industry collaborators. Support shall be provided for clinical trials conducted under INDs/IDEs and IND/IDE-exempt (non-IND/IDE) clinical trials.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded. The Government estimates the effort to perform the base requirements of the Statement of Work (Year 1 and Option 1 - additional Years 2 through 10) to be approximately 5.50 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year. Additionally, the anticipated contract award will contain options for increased levels of effort in increments of 25% over the base requirement which can be exercised up to 3 times per contract year. Options for electronic data submission to an internal DAIT-wide system as well electronic submission of IND/IDE documents to the FDA will be included. The Government estimates a 10% increase in the level of effort for each optional activity during the applicable period.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) located in Alexandria, LA has a requirement for a demonstration project featuring non-rock alternatives for shoreline protection along coastal areas in Louisiana. The NRCS is soliciting a Request for Technical and Cost Proposals (RFP) for systems to be used as non-rock alternatives for shoreline protection construction contracting. <br />
<p><br />The intent of this demonstration project is the installation of a non-rock shoreline protection system(s) at three different locations in coastal Louisiana. The system or system(s) shall be designed, fabricated, transported and installed by the Offeror(s) adjacent to and tested against other non-rock shoreline protection systems. Site locations are identified as "Shark Island" located on the western side of a peninsula separating Vermilion Bay and Weeks Bay in Iberia Parish, "Lake Salvador" located on the southeast shoreline of Lake Salvador in Jefferson Parish, and "Bayou Perot" located on the western shoreline of Bayou Perot in Lafourche Parish, LA.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to install and monitor various shoreline protection system(s) in areas of the state where physical, logistical and environmental limitations preclude the use of currently adopted methods. Factors which will play a major role in these endeavors are unstable soil conditions, subsurface obstructions and accessibility problems which severely limit the alternatives of shoreline protection. Proposed shoreline protection system(s) shall be signed for a 20-year life and have the capability to significantly reduce shoreline erosion rates and potentially promote sediment accretion while also considering environmental and physical challenges at each site.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 240 calendar days. The RFP will be issued approximately 15 calendar days from the date of this notice. This acquisition is a total small business set aside. All responsible offerors will be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>As a planning tool and to assist all offerors, we are providing advance notice of the dates for the site showings. The site showings have been scheduled for November 16 &amp; 17, 2011 in each of the three locations identified in this notice. The specific details relative to the times and meeting locations will be provided in the solicitation package to be posted on or about November 15, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Developmental Stage (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to two additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
 Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).
 Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
 The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.
 This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission date of January 10, 2012 and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ Districts); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.
  The BOA shall be between NAVFAC Southwest and the 8(a) firm only.  The BOA will not be between NAVFAC Southwest and a Joint Venture/Mentor Protg firm.  TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. After carefully reviewing the submittal requirements checklist to ensure compliance, please submit your package to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Laurel Colon/Redna Fork, Code RAQ20, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, or via email to laurel.colon@navy.mil and redna.fork@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on January 10, 2012.

<CONTACT>Morie Gunter-Henderson, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3646, Fax 301-492-3437, Email Morie.GunterHenderson@nrc.gov
<DESC>Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," to 10 CFR Part 50, General Design Criterion (GDC) 2, "Design Bases for Protection Against Natural Phenomena," requires, in part, that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety must be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. This includes not only the effects of shaking, but also possible shear or volumetric deformations in the underlying geologic foundation materials. Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites," provides guidance on seismic assessments, but currently provides minimal guidance on how to conduct deformation assessments. <br /><br />Traditionally, site performance has been assessed using the assumption (either implied or explicitly) of one-dimensional (1D) propagation of waves, at both an element level and a site-scale level. These 1D analyses often include assessments of both seismic shaking and of seismic deformations. However, over the past decade or more, there has been a significant increase in the awareness that this may not always be appropriate (and is possibly un-conservative) in some cases. <br /><br />On an element level, there is a fundamental understanding that soils are sheared in three dimensions during earthquakes, although very limited research has been performed to assess the related multi-dimensional effects. This is true in part because specialized equipment (i.e. multi-directional simple shear) is required and the large majority of testing is performed using the more common 1D or 2D equipment. There are currently very limited datasets of bi&not;directional simple shear laboratory testing to elucidate the effects of multi-dimensional loading. However, the limited research that has been performed on dense sands to date indicates that current modeling tools, which are based on early unidirectional testing, will under-predict deformations in sandy materials in some cases. Understanding the true potential deformations in dense sandy materials under multi-directional loading is essential for undertaking reliable performance-based assessments of nuclear installations. Dense sands and sand mixtures are the most common soil types found at proposed non-rock nuclear sites. Because some multi-dimensional element level simple shear laboratory testing results have served to highlight the critical importance of developing a better understanding of multi&not;dimensional loading in deformation-focused performance-based engineering, the NRC is initiating a coordinated research effort to address several inter-related issues related to multidirectional loading of nuclear sites. This request for proposal is part of that effort. Using tools, such as high-end soil-structure-interaction methods, the impact of 2D and 3D seismic loading on a nuclear power plant and its site, including the effects of soil deformation on the structural foundation and piping, can be analyzed. However, undertaking these analyses requires 3D material constitutive models. Unfortunately, as a result of the general lack of multidirectional laboratory data available, there has been limited development and validation of soil constitutive models focused on 3D loading. This project addresses this need by undertaking both the testing and modeling tasks needed to further develop existing constitutive dense sand models. <br /><br />The NRC is currently also undertaking a separate program to develop a new open-source Soil&not;Structure-Interaction (SSI) modeling tool based on the OpenSEES platform for the purpose of undertaking collaborative and in-house research on performance-based design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). New multi-dimensional dense sand models are needed for this upcoming SSI research. Models developed in the project described here must be compatible with this OpenSEES-based platform. <br /><br />In addition, there is now an understanding that the element-level behavior of sands under multi&not;directional loading (in terms of modulus degradation and damping curves) is sometimes very different than under 1D loading and is a function of ground motion rotation in addition to loading. Currently the NRC has a separate cooperative program with the Bureau of Reclamation underway to develop new multi-dimensional site response tools focused on the impacts of multi&not;directional loading on shaking. Efforts will be made by NRC staff to bring synergy between these projects to the degree possible. <br /><br />The objective of this contract is to investigate an area of seismic performance in which recent work has shown that current tools and methods may be un-conservative. This work will improve understanding of the behavior of dense sands and sandy material under multi-dimensional loading through appropriate laboratory investigations. This work will then develop one or more multi-dimensional dense sand constitutive models to be used in more accurate soil-structure &not;interaction of potential seismic deformations in soils at nuclear power plants sites that are subjected to seismic loading. <br /><br />The results of this work will develop part of the technical basis for an update of Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites" Currently the guide notes that deformation assessments must be undertaken, but provides little guidance as to how that is done. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about November 22, 2010, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for acquisition planning purposes only and does not represent a Request for Proposal or obligation on the part of the U.S. Government (USG).  Industry responses to this RFI will not represent binding offers, and the USG cannot accept an industry response to form a binding contract.  The USG intends to use any information submitted in response to this request to develop an acquisition strategy for future requirements (estimated USG Fiscal Year 2013 and beyond) of the subject items.  The USG will hold all information submitted in a confidential status.<br><br>The purpose of this RFI is for the USG to acquire information to assist in determining whether commercial items or non-developmental items are available that could meet the USG's requirements for the family of detonating cord items.  The USG has previously and currently procures detonating cords to a Military Specification, MIL-DTL-17124E w/Amendment 1, dated 13 December 2010.  This specification is available for review at the "ASSIST" website:  https://assist.daps.dla.mil/online/start/, click on "Quick Search", enter "17124" in the Document Number data field, click on "submit", click on "MIL-DTL-17124E(1), click on the Adobe (PDF) icon immediately to the left of "Revision E Amendment 1 (amendment incorporated)."  Please refer to MIL-DTL-17124 for current detailed requirements for the manufacturing, inspections, testing, and packaging for these Detonating Cord items. <br><br>Detonating Cord is used commercially in the mining and construction industries.  The USG military uses Detonating Cords primarily as a priming agent, breeching, or alone as an explosive charge.  The Inert-Dummy Detonating Cord is used primarily in training demolition personnel in the proper procedures for priming demolition charge.  The DoD currently has known requirements for Detonating Cords:  Cord, Detonating: Type 1 Class E; and Cord Detonating: Reinforced.   Requirements for Cord, Detonating, Wirebound; and Cord, Detonating: Inert Dummy are anticipated but currently the quantities are unknown.  Currently planned annual requirements for each item are as follows for USG Fiscal Years 2013-2016:<br><br>                     <br>TYPE 1E: <br>FY13: 3,603,999'<br>FY14: 3,687,580'<br>FY15: 3,724,941'<br>FY16: 3,784,912'<br><br>REINFORCED:     <br>FY13: 185,000'	<br>FY14: 185,000'	<br>FY15: 185,000'	<br>FY16: 185,000'<br><br><br>Following is a brief description of need for each type:  <br><br>The Cord, Detonating: Type 1 Class E consists of a minimum core of 50 grains per foot of PETN with an optional center string, protected by layers of material: an optional paper liner, braided or counter wrapped textile, and an olive drab plastic sheath.  The cord has the maximum diameter of 0.235 inches.  The cord has a detonating velocity of not less than 5,900 meters per second and is waterproof.   (NSN: 1375-00-180-9356, DODIC: M456)<br><br>The Cord, Detonating: Reinforced consists of a minimum  core of 50 grains per foot of PETN with an optional center string, protected by layers of material: an optional paper liner, braided or counter wrapped textile, plastic sheath, braided or counter wrapped textile, and an olive drab wax finish.  The cord has the nominal diameter of 0.200 to 0.215   0.010 inches.  The cord has a detonating velocity of not less than 5,900 meters per second and is waterproof.   It will function after 72hour water submersion; provided one of the cut is dry (6-in.min).  (NSN: 1375-00-028-5168, DODIC: M456)<br><br>The Cord, Detonating: Wirebound consists of a core PETN with an optional center string, protected by layers of material: optional paper liner, braided or counter wrapped textile, plastic sheath, bronze wire, braided or counter wrapped textile, and an olive drab wax finish. It will function after 24 hour submersion, provided the cut ends have been protected or have 6-in. free ends.

The cord is inert and used for demonstration and training for demolition.  (NSN: 1375-00-621-8373, DODIC: M458)<br><br><br>It is the Federal Government's preference to acquire commercial items (to include non-developmental items) when available to meet the agency's requirements, as contained in Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355).  <br><br>The definition of "Commercial Item" as stated in FAR 2.101 includes:<br><br> 	(1) Any item of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for other than governmental purposes; <br><br>(2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (1) that is not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy Government delivery requirements under a solicitation;<br><br> (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expressed in paragraphs (1) or (2), but for - (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace, or (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements.  <br><br>"Minor modifications" means modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process.  Therefore, items that require minor Government-unique modifications are Commercial Items, as long as they meet the definition as stated above.<br><br>The definition of "Non-developmental item" as stated in FAR 2.101 includes:<br><br>(1) Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency...;<br><br>(2) Any item described in paragraph (1) of this definition that requires only minor modification or modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace in order to meet the requirements of the procuring department or agency<br><br><br>This RFI solicits information and comments from commercial detonating cord manufacturers regarding current commercially available detonating cords or modifications required to those currently available, to meet the USG detonating cord requirements.  The USG requests the following specific information from interested and capable detonating cord manufacturers in response to this request:<br><br>a)	A description, including catalogs, product data sheets, specifications, inspection/test results, etc.; of currently available commercial detonating cord items that could meet the USG requirements; including any modifications required to meet specific USG requirements for these items as stated above.  Please include in the description a comparison/contrast of commercial equivalents against the USG detonating cord specification requirements.<br>  <br>b)	A description of the current commercial standards for inspection and testing of detonating cords that are commercially equivalent or very similar (requiring minor modifications).  Please include in the description a comparison of these commercial inspection/test procedures and requirements against the currently required USG inspection/test requirements per MIL-DTL-17124E.  <br><br>c)	Customary commercial business practices regarding modifications or tailoring of available detonating cord items to meet customer needs and associated estimated costs.<br><br>d)	Customary commercial business practices, including product warranties, buyer financing, discounts, etc. under commercial detonating cord sales.  Any restrictions for shipping/transportation of the detonating cord items to DoD facilities across the contiguous U.S. or to ports for export to foreign military customers.  The USG typically constructs F.O.B. Origin shipping arrangements on contracts for items containing explosives.   <br><br>e)	A description of the respondent's company, including technical/manufacturing capability, description of facilities, personnel, capacity, and current/past experience successfully producing detonating cords.  Please include estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities for these items and the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for production.<br><br>f)	A statement of whether the respondent would plan to submit a formal proposal/offer to the USG as a prime offeror, in response to a formal Request for Proposal for the detonating cords as commercial items with minor modifications/non-developmental items.  Include the current size status of the respondent for NAICS code 325920 Explosives Manufacturing (size standard 500 employees or less for Small Business).  <br><br>g)	If a respondent is not a detonating cord manufacturer but proposes to act as a prime offeror/contractor for a commercial detonating cord manufacturer, please provide all information requested above for the actual manufacturer of the items.  <br><br><br>The information requested above is requested within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to HQ, Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, ATTN:  CCRC-AM (M.

<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty,windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />Period of Performance - The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew.</p>
<p>II. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>a. U.S. citizen, eligible for a State Department Secret or Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. J.D. from an accredited law school.<br />c. At least 10 years of legal experience.<br />d. Excellent writing and communication skills.<br />e.

<p>The incumbent coordinates and communicates with the INL/Kabul Justice and Corrections Advisors, and the INL/AP Rule of Law and Corrections Teams. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.

<p>Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty,windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Design-Build construction services for a Multiple Award Construction Contract to perform Steam Decentralization Projects, MCB Camp Lejeune, North Carolina area as follows:

MCB Camp Lejeune utilizes six (MCAS New River, Camp Geiger, Camp Johnson, Hadnot Point, Courthouse Bay, and the Rifle Range) central steam generation and distribution systems to provide space and domestic water heating to 548 facilities.  

Replacement of a central steam system will entail the removal of steam equipment at each facility and the installation of natural gas fired hot water appliances and hot water equipment to meet heating load requirements.
  There are four basic scenarios:

1- Nodal systems include the installation of natural gas fired hot water boilers housed in new facilities (stand-alone structures).  The nodal system will distribute hot water via loops to serve multiple (3+) buildings in close proximity to one another.

2- Facility systems include the installation of natural gas fired hot water boilers housed within existing facilities (possibly expanded mechanical rooms).  The facility system will serve only the facility in which it is installed.

3- Multi-Facility systems include the installation of natural gas fired hot water boilers housed within existing facilities (possibly expanded mechanical rooms).  The multi-facility system will distribute hot water via loops to serve up to 2 additional buildings.
  Multi-facility systems will be used when the required capacity of newly installed boilers at 1 facility is sufficient to meet demand of adjacent facilities.

4- Heat Pump systems include the installation of electric heat pumps and hot water heaters to provide space heating/cooling and domestic water heating.  Heat pump systems will be limited to small facilities (less than 5,000sf).

Most facilities are equipped with hot water systems and will not require substantial facility heating system reconfiguration or installation of new heating system components beyond boilers and heat exchangers.  

Facilities utilizing direct steam to provide space heating via radiators or similar technology will require the installation of new heating system components to replace the steam components.
  Conversion of these facilities to hot water will be required and may include the installation of hot water piping, pumps, ductwork, air handlers, air blenders, variable air volume systems, etc.  Specific details on reconfiguring these facilities will be addressed during design.

TASK ORDERS

Steam Decentralization:
FY12: Task Orders - MCASNR ($18M) - Johnson ($12M) - Geiger ($7M)
FY13: Task Orders - Hadnot Point ($40M)  French Creek ($15M) - Courthouse Bay ($4M) - Rifle Range ($2M)

The target awards range between $2 million  $40 million.  All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, and certified 8(a) small businesses are encouraged to respond.
  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services no later than July 2012.  The appropriate NAICS Codes is 238220 and 237990.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.
  It is requested that interested SMALL businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 25 pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice. There will not be a solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time. 

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUB Zone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform the proposed contracts. 

NAVFAC MIDLANT anticipates awarding a Multiple Award Contract(s) for Remedial Action Construction (RAC) for projects within the Northeast Integrated Product Team NEIPT) Area of Responsibility (AOR), located in the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.
  The contract will be awarded to a maximum of five (5) contractors. The contract will be for three year duration: base year plus two option years, with an estimated contract value of $30,000,000.

General Work Requirements: 

The Contractor shall provide the personnel, tools, equipment, materials, transportation, and management to perform Remedial Action Construction services as required and negotiated in each individual task order. 

Remedial Action Construction (RAC) is the phase of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process where the site remedy is constructed either as an interim or final action. This phase may include the construction of various soil, sediment and/or groundwater remediation systems that function as containment (e.g.
 soil cover, RCRA cap, slurry wall, pump & treat systems); in-situ treatment (e.g. natural attenuation, soil vapor extraction, enhanced bio-remediation, air sparging) or ex-site treatment (air stripping, constructed wetlands, offsite disposal, stabilization, solidification).

In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services. The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems.
 The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.

Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures: 

Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards. Typically, only price and past performance will be considered. When required, we will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.

The range for individual task orders $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.

One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUB Zone Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement. If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals. All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for these contracts in May 2012. The appropriate NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.

It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package not to exceed 5 pages.
 This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:

(1) Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated. Knowledge of the state regulations within the AOR.

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis<br /><br />Maintenance of NRC Codes</p>
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis, and is not a Request for Proposal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than November 25, 2011. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email&nbsp; responses are acceptable to <a href="mailto:Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov">Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov</a>&nbsp;or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Carol Greenwood, Division of Contracts, Mailstop: TWB-01-B10M, Washington DC 20555-0001.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors and nuclear materials in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and providing regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions made by the agency, and in addition prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues of current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>In support of the above activities, RES has responsibility for the development, testing, assessment, maintenance, and user support of the NRC's thermal-hydraulic (T/H) computer codes. These codes include</p>
<p>&bull; TRACE (TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine) is NRC's flagship thermal-hydraulics analysis tool. It is a modernized thermal-hydraulics code designed to consolidate the capabilities of NRC's 4 legacy safety codes - TRAC-P, TRAC-B, RELAP, and RAMONA. It is able to analyze large/small break LOCAs and system transients in both PWRs and BWRs. The capability also exists to model thermal hydraulic phenomena in both 1-D and 3-D space. It also includes the ability to model 3-D kinetics through integration with the Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator (PARCS) code.</p>
<p>&bull; PARCS (Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator) is a computer code that solves the time-dependent two-group neutron diffusion equation in three-dimensional Cartesian geometry using nodal methods to obtain the transient neutron flux distribution. The code may be used in the analysis of reactivity-initiated accidents in light-water reactors where spatial effects may be important. It exists both as a stand-alone program and as a separate computational module coupled to other thermal-hydraulic codes. In this latter context, the source code for PARCS is tightly integrated with TRACE. PARCS may also be run in a coupled mode with RELAP5 using a looser coupling technology called the Generic Interface (GI).</p>
<p>&bull; RELAP5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program) is a one dimensional (1-D) best-estimate T/H code that is primarily used for small-break loss of coolant accidents (SBLOCAs) and other transients.</p>
<p>The NRC has transitioned from RELAP5 to TRACE &amp; PARCS as its primary thermal-hydraulic analysis tool. As such, RELAP5 code development activities are at a very low level, limited to bug fixes and porting features from RELAP5 into TRACE.</p>
<p>Additional responsibility of RES includes maintenance of a thermal-hydraulic data repository which contains the results of experiments, tests, and assessments used to demonstrate applicability of T/H codes to its intended uses. Activities here include converting raw data files into the NRC's Platform Independent Binary (PIB) format and adding new information to the database in a structured format.</p>
<p>The NRC makes the above codes available to approved domestic users via a User Support Group, and foreign users participating in the international Code Applications and Maintenance Program (CAMP). The use of the codes by these organizations provides calculations and assessments needed to validate and improve the codes. Semi-annual international conferences are conducted by the NRC to discuss code results and related issues.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security is requesting information from existing service providers who can provide peer and merit review services required by any office or component of DHS.</p>
<p>B. Peer and Merit Review Services</p>
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1.1 Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is committed to using the most effective technologies and scientific talent to safeguard the country. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) has been charged with marshalling the U.S. science and engineering community to provide federal, state, and local officials with cutting-edge tools and information to protect the homeland. S&amp;T uses all available sources to acquire science and engineering talent and tools, including universities, federal laboratories, private-sector companies, nonprofit organizations and international partnerships.<br />DHS S&amp;T has established eighteen (18) priority research and education areas that are applied to homeland security issues. In aggregate, these 18 multi-disciplinary areas incorporate virtually every scientific and engineering discipline. These are: Explosives Detection; Mitigation and Response, Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Risk and Decision Sciences; Human Factors Aspects of Technology; Chemical Threats and Countermeasures; Biological Threats and Countermeasures; Food and Agriculture Security; Transportation Security; Border Security; Immigration Studies; Maritime and Port Security; Infrastructure Protection; Natural Disasters and Related Geophysical Studies; Emergency Preparedness and Response; Communications and Interoperability; Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization; and Community, Commerce, Infrastructure Resilience, and Cyber-Security.<br />DHS S&amp;T has four (4) functional areas that will require the services provided under this proposed contract: the Centers of Excellence program, Education programs, Minority-Serving Institutions programs, and other Focused Research Area programs.</p>
<p>1.1.1 Centers of Excellence</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as amended) directs DHS S&amp;T to designate one or more university-based centers for homeland security, and to establish a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the Nation's security. DHS S&amp;T's Office of University Programs (OUP) established, and now manages, a coordinated network of twelve (12) cross-disciplinary university-based Centers of Excellence (COEs) to develop homeland security-related scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical (HS-STEM) research and education. OUP brings together experts from intersecting fields of study to perform research and development activities to provide critical homeland security tools, technologies, training, and talent.</p>
<p>1.1.2. Education Programs</p>
<p>Working with leading universities, DHS S&amp;T develops curricula, faculty, students, and well-trained professionals to provide the next generation of homeland security science and engineering leaders. The current education programs include Career Development Grants to institutions with existing homeland security-related (HS-STEM) programs, scholarships and fellowships to individuals studying in HS-STEM fields, summer internships for undergraduates interested in HS-STEM experience or careers, and fellowships for graduate education for existing DHS employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.3 Minority Serving Institutions Programs</p>
<p>S&amp;T's Minority-Serving Institutions Programs include the DHS Scientific Leadership Awards (SLA) for Associates, Bachelors, and Graduate degree granting institutions, and the Summer Research Team program, focusing on active integration of MSIs with the COEs.</p>
<p>1.1.4 Focused Research Project Programs</p>
<p>OUP anticipates making this vehicle available to other DHS S&amp;T offices. At that time additional funding and deliverables will be specified.</p>
<p>2.0 DISCUSSION</p>
<p>2.1 Overview</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T requires experienced contractor support for its well-established processes for managing and conducting SME peer and merit reviews. To accommodate these requirements for research, analysis, and technical services in the future, S&amp;T plans to award a competitive contract to a service provider who has existing capabilities and data sources listed below. The contractor must:</p>
<p>&bull; Possess a substantial existing database of relevant subject matter experts (SMEs) from a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines applicable to homeland security-related research (e.g., several thousand names and vitas). <br />&bull; Be experienced and skilled in organizing, supporting and implementing on-site (in-person), off-site (web-based), and mixed (in-person and web-based) peer and merit reviews of S&amp;T proposals and programs using the above-referenced SMEs. <br />&bull; Be experienced and skilled in organizing and facilitating multiple types of merit reviews including peer reviews, ad hoc reviews, focus groups, technical meetings and study groups of SMEs and professional practitioners using existing web-based interaction tools. <br />&bull; Have experience providing DHS S&amp;T and similar large scientific organizations with administrative, management, and logistics support for the conduct and facilitation of peer and merit review events. <br />&bull; Have experience providing organization and facilitation of a multi-day, multi-session annual program review of university research and education programs with federal, state, local, and private sector stakeholders participating. <br />&bull; Have experience planning, scheduling, facilitating, and documenting the results from technical meetings for scientific members and experts of the federal, academic, and non-profit and industry communities.</p>
<p>The DHS S&amp;T Office of University Programs' (OUP) mission relies on independent and objective expert reviews to ensure applicants to OUP's solicitations have the capability to produce high quality scientific and engineering knowledge and products that are relevant to DHS's mission. The contractor will support multiple types of peer and merit review activities. The primary aims are as follows: 1) ensure DHS S&amp;T awards the most qualified proposals; 2) ensure DHS supports research in the highest priority DHS mission areas and 3) enable DHS S&amp;T to assess performance on a regular basis. OUP will be a primary customer for this contract. However, the vehicle will also be available throughout DHS S&amp;T and DHS-wide to conduct similar peer and merit review activities where needed. OUP requires subject matter expert (SME) merit and peer review services and administrative, management and logistics support to facilitate the following:</p>
<p>&bull; COE Selection/Re-competition Peer Reviews, Site Reviews and mid-term reviews. <br />&bull; Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) Peer Reviews. <br />&bull; Education Program (Scholarships and Fellowships) Peer Reviews. <br />&bull; Annual Program Review Summit.<br />&bull; Topical grant competitions (e.g., explosives, border security, bio-surveillance)<br />&bull; Periodic (biennial or triennial) reviews of all OUP programs, goals and accomplishments<br />&bull; Ad-hoc technical research meetings, research needs assessments, and reviews on specific cross-cutting subjects.</p>
<p>Collectively, these activities ensure OUP is supporting the right research, selecting the best performers, facilitating communication among scientists, DHS Components and Homeland Security Enterprise partners, connecting results with end users and assessing performance on a regular basis. The Centers of Excellence are centered on topic-specific research areas that span multiple disciplines and performers. The Annual Program Review Summit is an opportunity to present and review the full body of research conducted through COEs. The event brings together academic, federal and private sector individuals to discuss discoveries to date, enable transition to use and explore future research directions.</p>
<p>OUP conducts focused technical meetings in discrete areas to identify highest priority research in existing and emerging areas. Meeting topics are based on customer interests, the necessity to understand all of the research and development taking place in a topic area or the need to ensure originality and avoid duplication. Finally, OUP conducts regular reviews of Centers of Excellence and other multi-year awards.</p>
<p>The ability of the Contractor to ensure the integrity of the process and provide high-quality results will be a key criterion in this contract. All aspects of the expenditure of taxpayer funds on DHS S&amp;T funded research or education projects are open to public scrutiny. The review and selection processes may have high visibility and widespread interest and must be unimpeachable.</p>
<p>The Contractor's support and management of a comprehensive review process is necessary to ensure confidential and fair evaluation of proposals without reviewer bias or conflict-of-interest. Conducting merit reviews with maximum process integrity is essential to ensure that awards are made only to the best research projects/institutions, and that funding decisions will stand up to any scrutiny and challenges. DHS S&amp;T depends on peer review involvement from the scientific community. The Contractor must be able to identify conflicts-of-interest and to elicit reviewers' acknowledgment of such potential biases when they exist. The Contractor must also have experience with the necessary processes to maintain confidentiality of the proceedings and results both during and after a review process, and to provide the fairest and most competent peer review possible.</p>
<p>The Contractor must be able to ensure that SME peer and merit reviews enable independent experts from a number of fields to perform an in-depth assessment of proposed projects prior to funding. To facilitate this, the Contractor must have existing access to a wide range of SMEs in each of the many fields in which DHS S&amp;T is involved. A significantly broad selection of experts is needed to assure the reviews will provide objective information from technical experts not affiliated with the applicants, i.e., who do not have a conflict-of-interest. The Contractor must have experience managing successful peer and merit reviews to validate the scientific merit of the proposed research tasks. The Contractor must also be able to provide objective documentation supporting decisions why particular activities were or were not selected for funding. Finally, the Contractor must be experienced in facilitating the generation of insights or unique questions from panels of independent SMEs that may not have otherwise been considered prior to the distribution of funds.</p>
<p>DHS estimates that, per year, the Contractor will arrange and facilitate up to:</p>
<p>&bull; Ten (10) peer/merit review activities (5-15 participants per review) in support of the Office of University Programs' COE, Education and MSI programs. <br />&bull; Fifteen (15) peer/merit review activities (5-15 participants per review) in support of DHS S&amp;T focused research area programs. <br />&bull; One (1) multi-day, multi-session Annual Program Review/University Network Summit (approximately 1000 participants). <br />&bull; Five (5) research-related technical meetings in support of the COE, Education, and MSI programs (30-200 participants). <br />&bull; Fifteen (15) research-related technical meetings in support of S&amp;T focused research area programs.</p>
<p>Technical meetings may be ad hoc, may consist of student scholarship and fellowship recipients, and may be in or out of the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. <br />. <br /><br />2.2 Center of Excellence Selection Review Process</p>
<p>For COE reviews, DHS receives proposals in response to Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) posted on the federal government's grant solicitation website www.grants.gov . DHS S&amp;T uses a three-phase selection review process to review these proposals and ultimately select institutions to become Centers of Excellence. This review process is described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Scientific Quality Review (External Review): A panel of external SMEs from academia, non-profit research foundations, industry, and federal, state, and local agencies conducts this review. The panelists must have expertise and/or experience in the academic disciplinary areas relevant to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) topic (e.g., explosives detection and mitigation, border security, etc.). The Contractor must have the existing capacity to accurately aggregate individuals' ratings (using electronic means) on selected review criteria and overall ratings (i.e., across reviewers) using a variety of central tendency or scoring rules, (e.g., mean, median, mode, "skating" or "diving" scores). The Contractor must calculate a final rating and outcome justification from the external peer review for each proposal received in response to the FOA.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Department of Homeland Security Internal Relevancy Review: As soon as possible following the external review, the Selection Manager convenes an Internal Review Panel of DHS SMEs to review proposals transmitted from the external review phase. (Note: only the best proposals will be transmitted from the external to the internal review panel). The internal review panel will focus on a different set of evaluation criteria specified in the FOA. These criteria are designed to identify the relevance of proposals to S&amp;T's mission, relative need for the research, and cohesion with other research projects funded by S&amp;T or other agencies. The Internal Review panel will focus on a range of criteria for proposed research, education, and/or outreach programs and the applicants' demonstrated capabilities to deliver research and development results. The internal review panel follows the same process as the external review and results in a final rating and justification for each proposal received from the external review panel.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Site Visit Review: A site visit review only applies when selecting or re-competing a COE. The site visit review team will evaluate proposals transmitted from the internal review phase. Reviewers will determine the extent to which the applicant's proposal and any site visit materials address the criteria stated in the FOA. The site visit team will focus on the applicant's ability to lead and manage interdisciplinary efforts addressing a national scope on homeland security</p>
<p>Mid-term COE Program Reviews <br />OUP conducts an evaluation of each COE every two to three years. The evaluation panel is comprised of both academic researchers (peers) from disciplines related to COE priorities and operational end-users of the COE's research and development products or knowledge. <br /><br />2.3 Education and MSI Programs</p>
<p>All education projects, including Career Development Grants and Minority-Serving Institutions programs are subject to a two-phase review process (Phases 1 and 2 described above) to ensure close fit to DHS' long-term scientific and technological workforce development needs.</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T has established an annual competition for HS-STEM Career Development Grants (CDG). DHS S&amp;T invites proposals from colleges and universities with established homeland security-related science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula to establish scientific career development awards to students in priority HS-STEM programs of study. The evaluation and selection of awardees follows phases one (1) and two (2) of the review process described above for Center of Excellence selection. <br /><br />DHS S&amp;T also solicits applications from qualified and accredited Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) Granting two-year Associate Degrees, four-year Bachelor's Degrees, and Graduate Degrees to establish homeland security scientific leadership programs in areas critical to homeland security. The DHS Scientific Leadership Awards (SLA) are intended to establish and support the development of MSI education programs in HS-STEM disciplines that are required to prepare students for careers in research and development of the technology which is needed to defend our nation. The evaluation and selection of awardees follows phases one (1) and two (2) of the review process described above for Center of Excellence selection. <br /><br />In support of the review processes for the COE, Education and MSI Programs described above, the Contractor will be expected to provide the following services, in combinations appropriate to the event at hand: <br />&bull; Assist in collecting white papers and full applications via electronic means from www.grants.gov and other sources, and organize these for review by SMEs.<br />&bull; Help DHS staff identify potential SMEs, scientists, and engineers in research areas related to the DHS mission to serve on merit review panels/study groups.<br />&bull; Create and maintain an electronic database of DHS-relevant SMEs and continually update this database as additional experts are identified.<br />&bull; Conduct reviews of relevant published and unpublished literature to identify SMEs qualified for peer and merit reviews.<br />&bull; Assist DHS staff in identifying specific academic and other experts suitable to review focused research project proposals, COE proposals, Education and MSI proposals, and COE progress by evaluating research quality, productivity, educational quality, management practices, outreach to, and interactions with customers, transition of research results, and involvement of minority serving institutions, among others. <br />&bull; Provide technical support, such as reviews of publications, to support the integrity of the review process.<br />&bull; Screen qualified reviewers for specific proposals and assist DHS in assigning proposals to panels, when more than one panel is running concurrently. Set-up proposals for electronic delivery and distribute to appropriate personnel and reviewers. <br />&bull; Provide trained moderators to facilitate the discussion of proposals with maximum objectivity and other activities with maximum productivity.<br />&bull; Establish a productive work environment for reviewers and provide technical and logistical instruction to peer and merit review panelists for the meeting.

Notice is given that VA NY/NJ Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN3) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source, RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical,  under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) for Direct-to-Patient Delivery Services.

VISN3 intends to add these delivery services via open market procurement in accordance with FAR 8.402(f) to a VISN-wide FSS-BPA awarded against Independence Medical's FSS contract, V797P-4439A 

This proposed procurement is based on the determination that the government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from only one source.

A major portion of the requirements and products for this procurement are satisfied by the base terms and product list of Independence Medical's FSS contract, V797P-4439A 

Direct-to-patient delivery services are not part of the base contract and therefore may be added via an open market procurement in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)

The NAICS Code is 423450
The SIN code is 65 II A

The proposed VISN3 FSS- BPA will incorporate the shipping requirements, to allow the shipment of medical supplies direct to patient's homes.  

This will serve to:

1.	Prevent missed deliveries to patients' when items are unavailable or out-of-stock at CMOPs
2.	Streamline the shipping process from four days to two days by eliminating the shipment from manufacturer to VISN facility and VISN Facility to patient.
3.	Lessen the need to warehouse products at the VISN3 facilities.

The Veterans Affairs Medical Centers Pharmacies requires all contractor's offering direct-to-patient delivery services be approved as a health care provider for shipment of prescription medical supplies and equipment. 
Response date (Deadline):

This notice is neither a request for proposals nor an invitation for bids. It is not a solicitation. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. 

A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

All written responses to this notice received by close of business on Tuesday, November 8, 2011 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive or sole-source procurement.

The information included in the response should provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements so that a fair assessment can be made. 

Only Fax or email responses (preferred) to the point of contact(s) listed below are acceptable.  No telephone calls, please.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA has developed a novel approach for active jet nozzle flow effectors, or chevrons,based upon shape memory alloy hybrid composite (SMAHC) technology. The concept involvesembedding pre-strained SMA actuators on one side of the chevron neutral axis in order togenerate a thermal moment and deflect the structure out of plane when heated. The forcedeveloped in the host structure during deflection and the aerodynamic load are used forreturning the structure to the retracted position. The NASA chevron design is highlyscalable and versatile, and easily affords active and/or autonomous (environmental)control. Prototype chevrons at 1:9 scale have been built and tested, including thermalcycling tests, repeatability tests, and tests with representative flow conditions at NASALangley. All aspects of the chevron performance were found to be very repeatable,including closed loop performance of the chevron tip to prescribed positions whileimmersing into and retracting from the flow.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan at: NASA LangleyResearch Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed composite manufacturing techniques to improvetraditional single vacuum-bag (SVB) processes. Although using an SVB technique in an ovenis a cost-effective non-autoclave method for producing high-performance composites, it isoften ineffective when a reactive resin matrix, or solvent containing matrix or prepregis used. NASA Langley has developed a double-vacuum-bag (DVB) process to overcome SVBdeficiencies by improving volatile managementand eliminating excessive resin bleed situations.To produce a void-free quality laminate from resin-impregnated prepregs, it is imperativeto deplete volatiles and solvents before commencing forced consolidation. The traditionalSVB assembly inherently hinders and/or retards the volatiles depletion mechanisms duringcomposite fabrication because a vacuum-generated compaction force is applied to thelaminate during volatile depletion period (i.e., B-stage). NASA designed their DVBtechnique to overcome such a deficiency. Specifically, NASAs DVB process eliminates thecompaction force generated by vacuum suction while in the meantime maintaining the vacuumeffectiveness for the volatile depletion. The technique has been proven and validated tobe effective for volatile management and resin content control in composites withreactive resin matrices such as solvent-containing phenolic and polyimide resin matrixprepregs.The NASA DVB process can also combine the infusion of resin and consolidation ofcomposite in one processing step. The molding assemblys double-vacuum environmentenables the improved void management and laminate net shape control. By using two vacuumenvironments during the curing process, a vacuum can be drawn during a B-stage of atwo-step cycle without placing the composite under significant compressive pressure.During the final cure stage, a significant pressure can be applied by releasing thevacuum in one of the two environments. Inner and outer bags are useful for creating thetwo vacuum environments, with a perforated tool between the two. The composite is placedon a tool, with the inner bag and tool plate defining the first environment. The secondenvironment is characterized by the outer bag, which is placed over the inner bag and thetool platesee graphic on left.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan at: NASA LangleyResearch Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Developed by researchers at NASA Langley Research Center, DAMAS uses an iterativealgorithm to deconvolute noise signals, allowing for more accurate quantification of theposition and strength of acoustic sources. Recent development of the DAMAS microphonephased array processing methodology allows the determination and separation of coherentand incoherent noise source distributions. The DAMAS technology represents a significantbreakthrough in the field of aero-acoustics.In 2004, NASA developed a deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources(DAMAS) that decoupled the array design and processing influence from the noise beingmeasured, using a simple and robust algorithm. DAMAS does not add any additionalassumption to traditional array processing/integration analysis. It merely extracts thearray characteristics from the source definition presentation. In 2005, three-dimensionalapplications of DAMAS were examined. DAMAS was shown to render an unambiguousquantitative determination of acoustic source position and strength.The present development, called DAMAS-C, extends the basic approach to include coherencedefinition between noise sources. The solutions incorporate cross-beamforming arraymeasurements over the survey region. While the resulting inverse problem can be large andthe iteration solution computationally demanding, DAMAS-C solves problems no othertechnique can approach. DAMAS-C is validated using noise source simulations and isapplied to airframe flap noise test results.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan at: NASA LangleyResearch Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

The Dept. of Veterans Affairs, VISN 4 CONTRACT OFFICE intends to NEGOTIATE a sole source award to NETSMART TECHNOLOGIES for a base year plus four (4) option year contract for the purchase of an ANNUAL SERVICE CONTRACT FOR THE NETSMART MTHADONE DISPENSING SYSTEM. This product will be used at VAMC PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY DRIVE C and will SERVICE existing equipment to maintain consistency and agency standardization. 

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: Under the authority of FAR 6.302, NETSMART TECHNOLOGIES is the sole proprietor of this dispensing system and the maintenance thereof, and no other supplies or services will satisfy VISN 4 VAMC Pittsburgh requirements. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Maintenance of this system performed by the proprietor is essential to and has the only solution to meet the agency's requirements at the using service Medical Facility. Further market research and analysis indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking a particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. The medical center has found that with this maintenance agreement, the agency can maintain its current standardization requirement and consistency within the medical facility. The government would incur undo substantial cost and risk by using a different vendor that has not been certified and trained by the NETSMART TECHNOLOGIES on performing annual maintenance. The cost to compete in an attempt to procure different brand name product does not out weight the benefit of maintaining our current standardization and consistency within the agency's operating facilities. 

This notice of intent is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation of proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Jesse Rumbel, jesse.rumbel@va.gov no later than November 4, 2011@ 12 pm Eastern Standard Time. No telephone or fax request shall be accepted.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUN 2004)<br />For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br /><br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. <br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. <br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. <br />The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) administers and enforces the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) and related laws, which primarily establish safeguards for union democracy and union financial integrity and require public disclosure reporting by unions and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The LMRDA establishes certain minimum standards that unions must observe in conducting elections of officers which include notification of nomination and election proceedings, secret ballot voting among the members in good standing where required, the prohibition against the use of union or employer funds to promote the candidacy of a particular individual, as well as other safeguards to ensure a fair election.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The LMRDA provides that a union member may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor after pursuing internal union remedies. The LMRDA provides for the Secretary to investigate each complaint and, if a violation is found that has not been remedied, to file a civil suit in federal district court within 60 days after the member filed the complaint. Due to this statutory limitation, election investigations must be conducted expeditiously.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) owns a number of properties throughout the United States that are improved with USAR facilities. New development and changing land use patterns in the vicinity of these properties have created value in them for higher and better uses. By offering these properties in exchange for existing and/or to be constructed facilities, the USAR will update and strategically realign its inventory of training facilities.</p>
<p>The Real Property Exchange (RPX) Program is conducted under the legislative authority of 10 USC 18240, as amended (see: <strong>Appendix 1</strong>). Commonly known as the "Exchange Authority", this legislation permits DOD reserve components to convey certain real property assets to States, local governments, local authorities, or private parties in exchange for facility or facilities, existing and/or to be constructed, including utility services for the facilities. The cost of the Replacement Facilities must be of a combined value at least equal to the fair market value of the property to be conveyed, as determined by the Government.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Exchange Authority, acceptance of replacement facilities or additions to an existing facility requires the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Housing {DASA(I&amp;H)} to determine that the facilities:</p>
<p>(1) are complete and usable, fully functional, and ready for use;</p>
<p>(2) satisfy all operational requirements; and</p>
<p>(3) meet all applicable Federal, State, and local requirements relating to health, safety, fire, and the environment.</p>
<p>In this Notice of Availability ("NOA"), the Government is offering to convey fee title to the land and facilities of the Area Maintenance Support Activity #45 (AMSA and the "Exchange Parcel") consisting of approximately nine (9+) acres, more or less and approximately 0.31 acre of easement interest, located within Orland Park, Illinois, in exchange for the construction, replacement and improvements to utility infrastructures at the Philip H. Sheridan United States Army Reserve Center, Highwood, IL, hereinafter referred to as the Replacement Facility.</p>
<p>The NOA process established for this RPX Project is structured to ensure that the Government receives the best value from a qualified and responsible Offeror. The exchange process is composed of the following four steps, discussed in detail in Section VI, pages 13-21 of this NOA:</p>
<p>(1) Qualification Requirements. Interested parties (or "Offerors") must meet the qualification requirements of this NOA by submitting a description of the qualifications, experience and past performance of the team that will fund and satisfy the Government's objective, documentation demonstrating the Offeror's financial and technical capability and capacity to perform, and a line of credit from a financial institution. Interested parties must also submit a deposit to fund the estimated cost of the administrative actions required to complete the proposed exchange.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>(2) Submission of Applications. Offerors provide written submissions which</p>
<p>satisfy the requirements set forth in this NOA.</p>
<p>(3) Offeror Evaluation Process. An Evaluation Board (EB) reviews the</p>
<p>applications which have been received from Offerors and selects an Offeror</p>
<p>as a conditional Exchange Partner, subject to approval by the DASA (I&amp;H).</p>
<p>After DASA (I&amp;H) approval, the Exchange Partner enters into a Letter</p>
<p>Agreement (<strong>Appendix 3</strong>) with the USACE Savannah District. The Letter</p>
<p>Agreement is in furtherance of good faith and exclusive negotiation of a Real</p>
<p>Property Exchange Agreement (<strong>Appendix 4</strong>) between the Exchange Partner</p>
<p>and the Government. Either party may terminate negotiations prior to the</p>
<p>execution of the Exchange Agreement.</p>
<p>(4) Exchange Agreement. The specific business terms and legal conditions</p>
<p>associated with the exchange will be documented in the Exchange</p>
<p>Agreement, including draft conveyance documents. Final execution of an</p>
<p>Exchange Agreement requires completion of required National</p>
<p>Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis. The Exchange Partner may do</p>
<p>more environmental work to comply with the Exchange Partner's due</p>
<p>diligence requirements.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). No Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement will be made. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (RDC) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.
<p>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was a case that revealed several glaring technological gaps in responding to oil disasters. One of the issues was determining the location of subsurface plumes and making timely decisions to prevent significant ecological damages. While some advances have been made during the Deepwater Horizon incident for tracking underwater plumes, a robust and efficient strategy for sampling the waters to determine the extent of the plume and the proper detection system to go with it is still lacking. The detecting technology would need to provide data in real time (live feed data stream) to enable a quicker response or a more efficient monitoring for the submerged plume.</p>
<p>Most spills occur over a shorter period of time and closer to shore than the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. There is a very short timeframe for decision-making to protect the environment, numerous water-intakes, and commercial facilities located along the shore and on rivers. Challenges in detecting oil within the water column include poor visibility in deeper waters, difficulty in tracking oil movements in fast-moving currents, and only being able to discover very low levels of oil or dispersed oil at all depths.</p>
<p>This procurement is the first step in the process of developing an entire mitigation system to discover and mitigate oil within the water column in a variety of conditions. Previous work has been done on almost all of the components and many references can be provided via CD-ROM or are listed in the GFI section. Included are some of the latest efforts during the most recent spills and the research performed. However, there remains a need for a consistent detection system that can be adaptable to a variety of conditions, from rivers to near shores, and that has the ability to detect different types of oil.</p>

<DESC>Question and answer 11/1/2011<br /><br />Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">According to your drawing (No. PD-CSX-GRTG-0001) attached your document (205443_Attach_A), we assume that we have to make 3 pcs. of holes to the half position of thickness from the bottom surface of substrate.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">But, according to the table "B1 Grating Substrates Technical Specifications"</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">in page 6 of 12 for "Attachment 2 (Statement of work/Technical Specification), we can find out sideling holes only.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">In order to make gratings, it is convenient for us not to have vertical holes.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">So, we would understand that we have no vertical holes on the substrate.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS PGothic'">Please confirm that we have no problem on this view.<br /><br /><br />Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; The request for gratings is only for the fabrication of the grating itself.&nbsp; The substrates will be provided by BSA and no holes shall be present at the gratings substrates optical surface. &nbsp; As clarification, the request for gratings does not ask the contractor to add any holes to the substrates.&nbsp; The substrates have 3 holes or channels running from side to side of the substrate and 3 more holes running from the back side of the substrate to met the side to side channels in the center of the grating. No holes at the optical surface.&nbsp; The&nbsp;holes at the substrates are&nbsp;only&nbsp;for holding the substrates to the&nbsp;grating holders in the monochromator.</span></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Central Bank of Nigeria <br />Information Technology Department<br />Plot 33, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Way<br />Central Business District, Cadastral Zone, <br />Abuja, Federal Capital Territory<br />Nigeria</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance to assist the Grantee in its effort to provide critical redundancy and information security to Nigeria's financial sector, while reducing the operating costs of Nigeria's banks.</p>
<p>The high cost of capital and stringent terms of repayment available from Nigeria's commercial banks have long represented a significant constraint on business development and economic growth in the country. To address the problem, CBN has advised Nigeria's commercial banks to reduce their operating costs by sharing power and ICT services where possible, with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of capital in the Nigerian market. Although this is not presently a legal or regulatory requirement, the commercial banks are taking CBN's guidance seriously. In fact, the Chief Information Officers of 19 of Nigeria's commercial banks have formed the "CIO Nexus", a working group focused on planning the implementation of these shared services.</p>
<p>This USTDA-funded TA will perform an assessment of several of the participating banks' data backup systems and DRCs, and compile a common set of requirements and standards for the development of a shared DRC which would significantly reduce costs to the participating banks through the use of shared operational, power, climate control, and ICT services. The TA will also make recommendations on the operational and business models for the Project, including shared fee structures, requirements for use, and strategies for implementation. CBN is expected to take the lead on the implementation of the Project, but the member banks of the CIO Nexus have expressed their support for the Project and their desire to participate in this TA.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $510,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm, Local (Abuja) Time, December 16, 2011 at the above address.</strong> Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><p>*** This amendment is to correct the part number. The part number for this Sought Synopsis Request is hereby changed from 39-163170 to 39-163180. The Response Date has been extended to 15 Nov 2011***</p>
<p><br />This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein. <br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 207 each "C-5 Servo Valve, Hydraulic" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the C-5. The C-5 Servo Valve, is considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the antiskid brake control system. Antiskid brake systems are designed to reduce brake lock-up, resulting in skidding of the tire, while at the same time allowing the maximum brake capability to be applied in order to optimally to stop the aircraft. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the servo valve it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. For this reason, it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Crane Aerospace's own expense. Since the data required to manufacture the C-5 Servo Valve, the next higher assembly, and the brake control manifold are limited to Crane Aerospace, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the servo valve and test/prove functionality of the servo valve when assembled on the brake control manifold assembly at their own expense. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis. <br />NSN: 4810-00-441-4468<br />Part Number: 39-163180<br />Noun: Servo Valve, Hydraulic<br />System: C-5<br />Quantity: 207 <br />PR: Multiple Purchase Requests as Required</p>

<DESC>Background: Potable water and gray water (wastewater that does not contain body or food wastes, i.e., from showers and washing machines.) account for a substantial percentage of the logistics support convoys in current Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating gray water and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to bring in potable water and remove gray water. Water logistics plays an increasing role at the tactical edge, where small FOBs are regularly distributed throughout remote regions.<br><br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for water recycle/reuse technology that will, at a minimum, improve the water efficiency at Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOBs during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies.<br><br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through <br>2013 is $1.75M. The estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project is $560,000 in Fiscal Year 2012 and $1,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2013. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions.<br><br>Multiple Awards: The Government anticipates awarding up to two (2) contracts as a result of this topic.<br><br>Potential offerors should access the full topic description, terms and conditions, and proposal submission instructions by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm <br><br>Proposals that reflect a partial solution to the technical objective and description are not acceptable. The government will consider only those proposed projects that address all elements of the objective and description.<br><br>Proposals will be accepted 01 December 2011 through 09 January 2012. Proposals must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 09 January 2012 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), accessible at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Solicitation/Contract No. DTFAWA-12-R-08591.This amendment is to include Site Survey Visits and Vendor Q & A's dated 11.1.2011 (see attachements).  There are no other changes to this Market Survey.

Posting (brief abstract): 	The FAA is responsible for aviation weather observation services at designated locations, primarily airports, throughout the United States including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Since March 1995, the FAA has satisfied this responsibility through the use of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or the Aviation Weather Observing System (AWOS), FAA employees and contract weather observer personnel. 
Presently, the Contract Weather Observation (CWO) program utilizes 15 contractors, predominantly small and very small businesses, which provide weather observation services at 148 contract sites in FAA-owned or FAA-leased locations. 
The following summary represents the CWO locations aligned within the three (3) Service Areas.  They will be further divided into groups.  
- Eastern Service Area contains approximately 54 sites within the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  
- Central Service Area contains approximately 48 sites within the following states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.
- Western Service Area contains approximately 24 sites within the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and Hawaii.  
Alaska Service Area contains approximately 22 sites within the state of Alaska. 

Objective:
The objective of this Market Survey/RFI is to solicit feedback from sources capable of performing aviation weather observation services.  It is the FAA's intent to inform industry of a planned competitive contract(s) (estimated at over $100 million dollars) that will provide for aviation weather observer personnel to augment the ASOS and AWOS at selected airports throughout the United States, including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The small business community primarily provides the CWO Program its current weather observation services.  The FAA is now seeking to identify potential small businesses that have the experience and qualifications necessary to perform the services required. No solicitation package is currently available.  However, the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541990.  This future contracting opportunity will be set-aside for competition among small businesses unless the FAA determines that no adequate competition or capable small business sources exists. The FAA encourages subcontracting and teaming arrangements by all participants.   
The FAA seeks to identify small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that possess the following knowledge and experience:
1. Knowledge of FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) Orders, directives and policy relating to CWO services.
2. Knowledge, familiarity or experience with ASOS or AWOS.
3. Knowledge and understanding of the National Airspace System (NAS).
4. Previous experience providing or managing aviation weather observation service at multiple locations.
5. Previous experience, knowledge or management capability for a small business to manage other small businesses and/or small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in a contractual arrangement that would include handling payroll and reports for multiple locations or subcontractors. 
6.  The ability to provide and manage an aviation weather observation-training program.
For all questions related to this market survey, revised SOW, and Vendor Q & A's please contact the Contracting Officer:
Katherine Petito-Peverall, Contracting Officer, AJA-46katherine.petito-peverall@faa.gov(202) 385-8591
Vendors are encouraged to submit all/any questions NLT than October 13, 2011.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for a regulatory management center that will provide Regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance support to DAIT Office of Regulatory Affairs for trials conducted under all Networks funded by DAIT NIAID as well as for trials conducted by individual Principal Investigator's funded by DAIT through a non-Network Mechanism. The scope of this contract will cover all trials whether conducted under Health Authority Application or not.
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy,<br />Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. This includes support for clinical research programs and individual research projects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.</p>
<p>As the sponsor of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications for a large number of DAIT-supported clinical trials, there is an established requirement for DAIT to provide regulatory support to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312, and Title 45 CFR Part 46. In addition, all DAIT-supported clinical trials, including those conducted under FDA regulation, as well as IND/IDE-exempt studies and trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines: E2A Clinical Safety Data Management and E6 Good Clinical Practices (GCP), as well as country-specific regulatory regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish a Division-wide Regulatory Management Center to: (1) centralize all regulatory support services for DAIT-funded clinical research programs, currently carried out under multiple grants and contracts, into a single contract dedicated to regulatory affairs; (2) provide regulatory support services for individual clinical trial projects conducted under investigator-initiated cooperative agreement grants within a centralized contract; and (3) provide regulatory support services for future DAIT-supported clinical research programs and individual projects.</p>

<DESC>STATE HEALTH POLICY DATA BASE (SHPD) <br /><br />This is an amendment to the original small business sources sought notice posted on 10/25/11 to provide further clarification.&nbsp; The due date for capability statements&nbsp;remains 11/10/2011.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.
<p>Background. The NIH Common Fund was enacted into law by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act to support cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs that require participation by NIH Institutes/Centers or would otherwise benefit from strategic planning and coordination. In October 2010 the NIH Common Fund launched Health Economics Initiative to address the evolving needs of the health care sector for economic research.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the Program is to foster the collection/compilation of data that will be most useful for policy relevant empirical scientific research (www.commonfund.nih.gov/healtheconomics). The implementation of health care reform poses numerous challenges and will need to examine the innovation in State health policy statutes concerning health insurance market regulations, the organization of health care services and approaches of controlling costs. One of the major challenges in health policy relevant economics research is to interpret the economic and clinical incentives structure inherent in State statutes which can be converted into statistically analyzable variables of raw data files. The NIH now intends to develop a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to address this challenge. Further information about the purpose of the project can be obtained from the NIH Common Fund Health Economics Initiative Request for Information to Solicit Input on the Feasibility, Scope and Design of a State Health Policy Database which was issued on June 29, 2011 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-11-019.html)</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.<br />NIMH is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing potential contract services for a project entitled: "Development of State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to Advance Health Economics Research on Health Care Reform". <br />The purpose of this initiative is to develop a research tool that will document state-level policies in a manner that facilitates valid comparisons across states and over time. Insurance regulation, Medicaid policy, financing public health services, and, many reproductive health policies are all under state jurisdiction. Health care reform will add two major activities for states: 1) the establishment of state health insurance exchanges and 2) the Medicaid extension - both of them are aimed at reducing the number of uninsured.<br />Currently no State Health Policy Database (SHPD) exists which can be easily used by academic researchers to assess the comparative differences in States' policies over time and the potential impact of health care reform. Different public and private organizations have state policy level information from their specific perspectives, but there is no one integrated database for health policy research.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>The SHPD is envisioned as a core, multivariate, raw data set with carefully selected numerical or nominal variables on prioritized health policy domains which can be used for statistical/econometric analysis by computer software.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to develop and manage a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) for research purposes, over a 5-year period (including potential updates).</p>
<p>The SHPD will be populated with CY 2010 data and available for release as a public use data set on or about September 2014. Potential updates of the datasets are scheduled for CY12, 14, and 16, depending upon the exercise of contract options. Sources will be required to develop a website to access the SHPD. Data sets on State tobacco control policies developed and sponsored by various organizations can serve as potential examples (e.g., NCI/NIH tobacco control website and/or the American Lung Association's website).</p>
<p><br />Interested small businesses must also demonstrate they have the capability and a reasonable plan to provide for updates of the SHPD beyond the base year CY2010 data (i.e., updates for CY12, 14, and 16).</p>
<p>Development of the SHPD with CY2010 data requires the following skills, capabilities and capacities of any small business organizations:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge, experience and advanced training in health policy relevant research, specifically:<br />a. Knowledge and expertise in economic empirical research and econometric analysis<br />b. Legal knowledge of state health policy statutes relevant to current health care reform initiatives and ability to analyze the incentive structure of these statues<br />c. Knowledge and expertise to identify and prioritize the key policy and research questions in this area; sources will be required to convene and manage a one-day expert Scientific Panel meeting and to summarize its recommendations in this regard</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of and ability to access existing publicly available data sets and select most relevant variables for compiling the SHPD data set<br /><br />a. Knowledge of and ability to access publically available information from existing CY2010 multistate health policy databases (e.g. Kaiser Family Foundation database, Urban Institute Database, <br />COMPARE microsimulation model developed by RAND, federally collected and maintained databases by CDC and NLM and other organizations, like National Academy of State Health Policy, etc.)<br />b. Ability to abstract needed data from above data bases and include them in the SHPD<br />c. Ability to prioritize what variables will be included in the SHPD and what other variables will be linkable only to the SHPD</p>
<p>3. Advanced information technology expertise<br />a. IT expertise including research database design and documentation<br />b. User friendly simple website design that will be incorporated into the National Library of Medicine health services research database<br />c. Basic knowledge of computer software for statistical/econometric analysis</p>
<p>4. Data management capabilities<br />5. Project management<br />6. Ability to test the data set by health economists researchers, present the characteristics of <br />the data set in person and via webinar to potential researcher users</p>
<p>Other important considerations.<br />No IT equipment will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. July 2012 - July 2014 (with options to extend performance through July 2017)</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought.<br />Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services above, including:</p>
<p>1) Staff expertise that would be working on this project, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training<br />2) Prior completed projects of similar nature<br />3) Your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541720, 500 employees); and<br />4) Your management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #)</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes.<br />Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting, states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>

<DESC>Q1. "Is this project for a Category-I Airfield, or for an airfield that will deploy VFR/VMC and Non-Precision IFR/IMC operations?"
<p>A1. NAVAIR is seeking to a system capability to accommodate operations under CAT-I Precision IFR conditions but is also capable of being scaled down to accommodate non-Precision IFR or VFR operations when appropriate.</p>
<p><br />Q2. "Is Semi/Permanent Runway Centerline Lights (RCL) required by this contract?"</p>
<p>A2. Specific airfield lighting components have not been identified at this time."</p>
<p><br />Q3. "Is near IR LED capability for NVGs mandatory for this project?"</p>
<p>A3. Specific component performance parameters have not been identified at this time. Future requests for information may contain Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for individual components.</p>
<p><br />Q4. "... would your program office allow our Bidding Team to source that from a third-party OEM ... or you would frown on multi-tier Bidding Teams that include several OEM Sub-Contractors contributing the various pieces? For example, would it be acceptable to phase the deployment such that Solid State Lighting would be deployed immediately, and then later the Solar-powered LED (NVG-integrated) lighting would deployed?"</p>
<p>A4. The use of an appropriate sub-component third-party OEM is acceptable to achieve the desired KPPs once determined. As stated in the RFI, the acquisition strategy has not yet been finalized; therefore, discussion of a phased deployment schedule cannot take place at this time.</p>
<p>Q5. What range of system size is desirable - what size aircraft needs to be accommodated?</p>
<p>A5. Although Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) have not yet been defined, SLS must be capable of supporting all types and models of US Marine Corps aircraft, and other US forces and allied aircraft that support USMC operations.</p>
<p>Q6. Are you looking at runway lighting only, or are you considering apron and other lighting?</p>
<p>A6. Taxiway edge lighting is desired as part of SLS. Specific KPPs have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Q7. How portable does the system need to be? Are there time restrictions for set up and removal?</p>
<p>A7. Although it is envisioned that different elements of the SLS may have individual packaging, embarkation, set-up and removal requirements; specific KPPs have not been determined at this time.</p>
<p><br />Q8. The solicitation calls for potential support functions. What type of support is envisioned - technical, operational or both?</p>
<p>A8. Respondents to this RFI should state all levels of support - including, but not limited to: technical (design, follow-on troubleshooting), logistics (technical documentation, training, supply support), and programmatic (component integrations) - that they are capable of performing. It is not required that each interested party be capable of performing every support function necessary to develop, produce and sustain SLS.</p>

<DESC>Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," to 10 CFR Part 50, General Design Criterion (GDC) 2, "Design Bases for Protection Against Natural Phenomena," requires, in part, that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety must be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. This includes not only the effects of shaking, but also possible shear or volumetric deformations in the underlying geologic foundation materials. Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites," provides guidance on seismic assessments, but currently provides minimal guidance on how to conduct deformation assessments. <br /><br />Traditionally, site performance has been assessed using the assumption (either implied or explicitly) of one-dimensional (1D) propagation of waves, at both an element level and a site-scale level. These 1D analyses often include assessments of both seismic shaking and of seismic deformations. However, over the past decade or more, there has been a significant increase in the awareness that this may not always be appropriate (and is possibly un-conservative) in some cases. <br /><br />On an element level, there is a fundamental understanding that soils are sheared in three dimensions during earthquakes, although very limited research has been performed to assess the related multi-dimensional effects. This is true in part because specialized equipment (i.e. multi-directional simple shear) is required and the large majority of testing is performed using the more common 1D or 2D equipment. There are currently very limited datasets of bi&not;directional simple shear laboratory testing to elucidate the effects of multi-dimensional loading. However, the limited research that has been performed on dense sands to date indicates that current modeling tools, which are based on early unidirectional testing, will under-predict deformations in sandy materials in some cases. Understanding the true potential deformations in dense sandy materials under multi-directional loading is essential for undertaking reliable performance-based assessments of nuclear installations. Dense sands and sand mixtures are the most common soil types found at proposed non-rock nuclear sites. Because some multi-dimensional element level simple shear laboratory testing results have served to highlight the critical importance of developing a better understanding of multi&not;dimensional loading in deformation-focused performance-based engineering, the NRC is initiating a coordinated research effort to address several inter-related issues related to multidirectional loading of nuclear sites. This request for proposal is part of that effort. Using tools, such as high-end soil-structure-interaction methods, the impact of 2D and 3D seismic loading on a nuclear power plant and its site, including the effects of soil deformation on the structural foundation and piping, can be analyzed. However, undertaking these analyses requires 3D material constitutive models. Unfortunately, as a result of the general lack of multidirectional laboratory data available, there has been limited development and validation of soil constitutive models focused on 3D loading. This project addresses this need by undertaking both the testing and modeling tasks needed to further develop existing constitutive dense sand models. <br /><br />The NRC is currently also undertaking a separate program to develop a new open-source Soil&not;Structure-Interaction (SSI) modeling tool based on the OpenSEES platform for the purpose of undertaking collaborative and in-house research on performance-based design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). New multi-dimensional dense sand models are needed for this upcoming SSI research. Models developed in the project described here must be compatible with this OpenSEES-based platform. <br /><br />In addition, there is now an understanding that the element-level behavior of sands under multi&not;directional loading (in terms of modulus degradation and damping curves) is sometimes very different than under 1D loading and is a function of ground motion rotation in addition to loading. Currently the NRC has a separate cooperative program with the Bureau of Reclamation underway to develop new multi-dimensional site response tools focused on the impacts of multi&not;directional loading on shaking. Efforts will be made by NRC staff to bring synergy between these projects to the degree possible. <br /><br />The objective of this contract is to investigate an area of seismic performance in which recent work has shown that current tools and methods may be un-conservative. This work will improve understanding of the behavior of dense sands and sandy material under multi-dimensional loading through appropriate laboratory investigations. This work will then develop one or more multi-dimensional dense sand constitutive models to be used in more accurate soil-structure &not;interaction of potential seismic deformations in soils at nuclear power plants sites that are subjected to seismic loading. <br /><br />The results of this work will develop part of the technical basis for an update of Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites" Currently the guide notes that deformation assessments must be undertaken, but provides little guidance as to how that is done. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />All proposals are due in accordance with section L.7 2052.215-72 Timely Receipt of Proposals (OCT 1999). Any proposal not received by the specified time shall be considered late and not accepted into the competition. <br /><br />Any questions a potential offeror may have regarding this RFP must be submitted to the contracting officer, Matthew J. Bucher, in writing at the following e-mail address, <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bucher@nrc.gov">Matthew.Bucher@nrc.gov</a>. All questions must be submitted by May 11, 2011 at Noon (EST). Any question received after this time may not be considered and all answers to any potential questions will be made publicly available through this website. <br /><br />http://www.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html<br /><br />Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. <br />The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. <br /><br />The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $6.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541690.<br /><br />Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort. Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.

<DESC>The following questions were submitted for the subject white paper request. The responses are provided.  The Response Date remains 18 November 2011. The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) POC is Amy Cole, email is Amy.Cole@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer is Maria Martinez, email is Maria.L.Martinez@usace.army.mil. <br><br>Questions and Responses<br>W5J9CQ-12-R-0002G<br><br>Question 1: What are the historical cost bench marks? Or Do you have a specific budget for this project?<br><br>Response 1: We don't have any historical cost bench marks as each project is unique and I am not able to provide information on a specific budget for this project. I have calculated the contracting manpower equivalent (CME) for the project to be approximately 1.0. The CME is calculated by dividing the estimated number of labor hours needed to complete the research by 2080. The hours required to complete the research takes into consideration all members of the research team (e.g., senior scientists, entry-level contributors, etc.). If more (or less) time is required you are encouraged to provide an explanation to support your proposed effort.<br><br><br>Question 2: Should travel costs be included in the cost? If included, can you provide an estimated number of trips and destinations?  <br><br>Response 2: Yes, the travel costs should be included in the estimated budget for the project. Because ARI is open to different approaches to meeting the stated objectives (thus the general nature of the request), the number of trips needed to complete the work will vary with the type of work proposed. ARI would prefer a visit to Leavenworth to kickoff and closeout the contract (i.e., 2 visits to Leavenworth). As stated above, additional trips (e.g., to collect data) will be based on your proposed approach. <br><br><br>Question 3. Can the contractor substitute online or virtual meeting systems to control costs?<br><br>Response 3: This may be appropriate in some situations; but, in general, face-to-face meetings are preferred - especially for data collection events.<br><br><br>Question 4: What are the specific tasks associated with the project?<br><br>Response 4: Specific tasks have not yet been specified for this project. As stated in #2 ARI welcomes many different approaches to meeting the stated objectives. It is up to you and your research team to determine the best scientific approach for gathering the information needed to (1) answer the proposed questions (i.e., what skills facilitate socio-cultural systems thinking) and (2) develop a set of practice exercises.<br><br>Question 5: Are there any specific skills or education requirements for the personnel assigned to the project?<br><br>Response 5: Again, this will depend on the work proposed. Your research team should include individuals with the expertise needed to complete the work you propose.<br><br>Question 6. Is there anything we can submit beyond what is noted in the solicitation or beyond the 5 pages?<br><br>Response:  No. <br><br><br>Question 7:  Is corporate experience examples included in the 5-page limit?<br>Response: No, corporate experiences are not included in the 5-page limit. <br><br><br>Question 8.  Is there a minimum number of corporate experience examples that must be submitted?<br><br>Response 8:  There is no minimum. However, you should demonstrate experience relevant to the proposed work; and, as stated in the BAA, you are encouraged to include "up to three examples."<br><br>Question 9. Can the contractor substitute personal experience (along with references) for corporate experience?<br><br>Response 9:  You need to document experience relevant to the proposed work, whether that is corporate or personal.<br><br> <br>Questions / Response are also provided as an attachment.

<DESC>The Shallow Water Agile Submarine Hunting (SWASH) program intends to develop ASW surveillance and cued search capability for shallow water littorals without the use of traditional acoustics or sonar. DARPA seeks the widest range of possible sensing solutions to achieve this goal. The best solutions will allow for operations to be useful across all phases of conflict. The expectation is that sensing solutions with low size, weight, power, and cost offer the greatest opportunity for flexible integration into unmanned airborne platforms.

<AWARDEE>L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, 555 Industrial Drive South, Madison, MS 39110-9072 US
<DESC><p>As part of a broad CLS strategy to better define the Department of the Navy's NFO training requirements and to reduce total ownership costs, the Navy rebaselined the requirements for all CNATRA training platforms. Upon completion of the requirements definition process the Navy started the source selection process for a follow-on competition of this requirement. The existing contract, which has previously been extended, expires 30 September 2011; however, the follow-on contracting effort has taken longer than expected, therefore a new contract, with a nine to twelve (9-12) month period of performance is required. Without a short-term provision to bridge the gap between the end of the current contract and award of the new competitively awarded contracts, training of SNFOs and I-level maintenance services cited in Section 3 will halt on 30 September 2011.</p>
<p>The incumbent contractor, L-3 Vertex, is the only company that is in a position to immediately perform the required tasking for the limited period of time required. Any other contractor would be required to complete an inventory of the GFE, review and select qualified employees and coordinate with the unions concerning employment of the personnel covered by the Collective Bargaining Unit (CBA), and establish a management and administrative infrastructure at the two places of performance to include completion of required personnel training, licensing and certification. A Contractor other than the incumbent would need to spend a substantial amount of time during this short period of performance, becoming familiar with the platform, tools and equipment. Material requisitioning and maintenance and material management (3M) data reporting done through NALCOMIS, a system totally peculiar to the Navy, would also require considerable time to learn. Accounting of funds, inventory of all parts and materials, flight operation schedules, configuration management and delivery of associated CDRLs are requirements of this Contract that must be posted in an on-line database and accessible to Government clients on a real time basis. For this to be established in a short period of time would be extremely difficult. A sole source contract with a six (6) month base period and two (2), three (3) month options is necessary to ensure that there is no break in contract performance. Given the time constraints, there is insufficient time to award the new CLS contracts before 30 September 2011. This provision is necessary to ensure that CNATRA can complete its training mission and support fleet operational requirements while the source selection process is being completed.</p>
