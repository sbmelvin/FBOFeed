<DESC>This is a Firm Fixed Price solicitation for a Non-Personal Services Emergency Medicine Physician Service.&nbsp; Emergency Medicine Physician Service is for a part time Physician Service in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquistion Regulation (FAR) SubPeriod of Performance: 01/01/18 through 12/31/18 or until filled by a permanent employee. <br /><br />Please ENSURE references are included who have working phone numbers/email addresses. <br /><br />We must have the contact phone number and e-mail address for the submitting physician and copies of board certification, licenses, DEA certifications, and ACLS, PALS, and ATLS certificates with dates attached to profiles for this bid. Profiles / CV s will be screened for such. Applicants without the needed information will not be considered. The ER Dept. has requested the fillable application be filled out as much as possible so we can get a better picture of the qualifications of the candidates. <br />This is for Non Personal Performance Based Service Contract of approximately 520 hours each for Emergency Medical Physician slots to be performed at Indian Health Services, Northern Navajo Medical Center, Shiprock, New Mexico depending on what shifts a contractor can fulfill. The Government is seeking a candidate to help fill the difficult gaps in the ER schedule. The Performance Based statement of work is attached. The required services are to commence January 01, 2018 or upon successful credential/cleared fingerprints through December 31, 2018. <br /><br />Tour of Duty:<br />Hours: We have 10 hour shifts. There is single coverage, except for 4-5 PM and 9PM-2AM. Day shift is 7AM-5PM. Evening shift is 4PM-2AM. Night shift is 9PM-7AM. Available shifts can come from a combination of weekday, weeknight and/or weekend shifts, including Holidays (Rates to be all inclusive). There may be schedule changes; however, the Contractor will be notified immediately of such changes. On the average, there will be 4 ten-hour shifts per pay period (two weeks), but that is only an average. This can vary greatly, depending on patient load and staffing. Contractors are sometimes sought for a need of several shifts to be filled within a short period of time. Even though not convenient, they frequently have to cover single shifts when needed. This can result in significant expense for those traveling a long distance, but cannot always be avoided. Contractors may have single shifts far apart from any other shift.
