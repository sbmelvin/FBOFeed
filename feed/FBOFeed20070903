<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USDA ARS PWA Office in Wapato, WA has a requirement for a Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification, designed for high performance purification and characterization of proteins, peptides and nucleic acids, which can perform routine procedures of any complexity with scouting and method optimization, and with biomolecule characterization such as peptide mapping. The system must perform all chromatographic techniques and scout for optimal binding and elution conditions, pH, gradient shapes and flow rates and use the UNICORN? or equivalent operating software to minimize preparation, run-time and repetitive tasks while retaining flexibility for easy manual operation. The system must have flow rates of 0.001 to 10 ml/min at pressures up to 25 MPa. Desktop Control system including:
- System pump with four pump heads in two pump modules
- Mixer for precision gradient formation
- Variable, multiwavelength UV-Vis detector, 190-700nm,
- Injection valve
- Control Box
- Accessory Kit
- Unicorn software package
- Unicorn dc5750 control unit with specially configured and tested RAID 1 with dual
  operating hard drives
- 19" LCD display
*  System start-up must be included
Fraction collector must be integrated into the Liquid Chromatography System (easy to program system). Slope, threshold, time and volume based collection modes; Fraction size must be 0.1 to 100ml with event marks for easy identification of fractions and peaks; Operate at +4 to +40?C with a max flow rate at 100 ml/min.
Fraction collector must also include the following:
- Tube rack for (95) 18 mm diameter tubes
- Tube rack for (175) 12mm diameter tubes
- Tube rack for (40) 30mm diameter tubes
- Flow diversion valve 
Columns
- The system must come with Ion exchange and reverse phase columns
We require the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials. The system we will use must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.

We require a flow rate range of .001-10 mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-3625 psi. 
Because the resolution we require may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation. The system must come supplied with both a 0.6 ml and a 2.0 ml interchangeable mixing chambers for gradients at higher flow rates. Because we will be using salt buffers, the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides. The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing PEEK. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.
The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.
The system should include the option of a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. This fraction collector must have the capacity to fractionate into 96-well microplates, 12mm, 18mm, 30mm, 250ml bottles or even larger vessels with prep rack.
The system must include 4 motorized valves for sample injection, column selection, and outlet flow selection. In order to facilitate cleaning, storage, selection of our various chromatographic columns, and further automation the system must have the ability to control 5 more optional motorized valves for a total 9 motorized valves. This is necessary for buffer selection, injection, flow diversion, diverting peaks to sample loops etc.  Also, these motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.
The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs. The software must allow complete manual control of all parameters and running conditions while running a method.
Control of motorized valves, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, and autosampler must all be possible from the system controller.
The pumps, UV, pH and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.
The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g. UV wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.
The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column. The system must include 2 switch valves to allow automatic buffer blending to give desired pH and salt concentration. 
The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system. The system must include a sample pump to automatically load up to 8 samples with the sample selection valve. 
Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution must be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, so we can be certain equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.
Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left unrecorded. Access to the controller must be by user name with password and level of access by each user must be definable by administrator. The software must be able to operate on the Windows XP operating system.
Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.
In order to protect our columns, the system must have a definable pressure limit system defined when the column is selected from a list which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  We also require that the controller allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.
The controller should permit automatic running of up to 99 different chromatographic programs in a user-designated sequence. It must turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved. The system must automatically and continuously be able to record throughout each chromatographic run the following parameters: flow rate; 3 auto-scaled UV signals; actual AND programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent pH; system pressure; accumulated time of run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector - and it must allow these recorded data to be called up later for interpretation and to aid in future replication of results. It must allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports.
Installation and training must be provided by the vendor, at no additional cost.   The system proposals should include spare parts we are likely to need during the first 12 months of operation. Equipment consists of  GE Health Care items
13681701 S AKTAPurifier 10 
18117740 Frac-920 Fraction Collector 
11001170 Flow Diversion valve SV-923
17516601 Mono Q 5/50 GL
17505701 URPC 4.6/100 

A RFQ is not available for this requirement and the USDA intends on negotiating with the only known source GE Health Care Bioscience Corp. for this requirement.  Interested firm are encouraged to submit proposals to the attention of Fred Gifford as listed in the notice.  See numbered note 22.

As a part of the OCR mission we are charged with the responsibility of efficiency and timeliness in processing EEO claims. Therefore, we require a secure tracking system to manage and maintain data and provide an expanded scope of informative reports while having the ability to interface with other USPTO database applications. The OCR is currently fulfilling this need via iComplaints Software, which is distributed by MicroPact Engineering Inc. The USPTO will add a module which increases the ability to track and organize this data and facilitate end of year (EOY) reporting. Micropact Engineering is the sole owner and distributor of this software. Therefore, it is the intention of the USPTO to acquire this module, report and maintenance from Micropact. This includes a base year and 4 option years.The base year will consist of the module, reporting, and maitenance. The option years consist of the EOY report and maintenance. The total value of the contract with options is $71,250.00. If there is anyone other company who thinks they can do this work, the company may send a capability statement.

<CONTACT>Patrica A. Fort Contract Specialist 2083733910     Pat_Fort@blm.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed-price quotes are requested under Request for Quotation (RFQ) Solicitation number DLQ070067.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  This solicitation is set-aside for small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990.  The Small Business Annual Receipts for the firm and its Affiliates, for the preceding three (3) fiscal years does not exceed $6.5 million. The line item number is: Line Item 0001, Physical Closure of Seven Abandoned Mine Land Adits, Quantity, 1 Lump Sum. Scope of Work Background:  Abandoned Mine Land (AML) investigations were conducted from the years 2000 to 2004 by the Boise District in the War Eagle Mountain area within the Owyhee Field Office.  These investigations resulted in the discovery of 23 dangerous open mine workings at Eight AML sites on War Eagle Mountain and in Silver City.  All of the workings pose significant threats to public safety.  This is especially true due to the increase in public visitation to the area in the past few years.   This project will reduce or eliminate safety hazards for Seven of the top priority sites that are located on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Issue:  The sites consist of 2 open shafts and 5 open adits generally located in T 5 S, R 3 W, Sections 4, 8, & 9, Boise Meridian, Owyhee County, Idaho.  All openings are easily accessible and are potentially very hazardous to the public.  All the prospects are located on War Eagle Mountain which is readily accessible by vehicle and is getting frequent visits from the public.  Because of the physical safety hazards found at these sites, the proposal is to mitigate and remedy any hazards these sites pose to the public while at the same time protecting habitat for bats where there are concerns. Remediation of abandoned open mine workings would depend on the type of opening, stability of an opening, and if wildlife habitat within a working (bat habitat) needs to be protected.  Any adit that has the potential for bat habitat, even if bat surveys identify no current use, will have bat gates or bat gate culverts installed.  Work would consist of installing BLM Wildlife Biologist approved bat gate culverts at 5 sites and fabricating bat friendly closures at the two shafts.  Solidifying foam would be used to help close off openings and seal the bat gate culverts in place.  All work areas would utilize waste rock from adjacent mine workings for custom finish work, fill, and contouring.   Work Performance:  Specific work to be performed by the contractor is listed below by each site of concern.  Where bat gate culverts are to be installed the structures will be supplied by the BLM.  These will be placed inside the adit and then the remaining open areas around the bat gate will be sealed off with solidifying foam and finished with waste rock available on site.  The contractor will be responsible for picking the bat gate culverts up from the Boise District ware yard and transporting them to the work site.  All other structures will be fabricated and/or constructed by the contractor as part of this contract.  Work may include the use of a backhoe, track hoe, bulldozer, and pickup truck.  Welding in a remote location will require mobile welding equipment.  Contractor is responsible for transporting all materials to the project locations.
