<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Continental Microwave & Tool Co. Inc., Exeter, NH.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain AMSTAR Performance Bay wave-guide adapters & terminations.  These components will be integrated into the Millimeter Wave Radar Projection System.  The complete system will provide complex multi-channel MMW scenes to a MMW radar seeker in real time as a simulated missile flight is flown.  The first copy of this system has already been built and is being installed in the first AMSTAR test facility.  This order is for parts that make up the second system to be installed in the second AMSTAR test facility.  It is the goal of the AMSTAR development team to directly duplicate systems from the first facility into the second.  This will provide reduced development time, compatibility between systems, test duplication, easier configuration control and a reduced spare requirement.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of development, documentation, engineering, and spare costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Continental Microwave & Tool Co. meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST December 6, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Will Galvin, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Will Galvin at William.galvin@mms.gov.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for services to be procurred under FAR part 15.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Ensco, Inc., cage code 06359, on behalf of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Reactor Products Program (RPP), for Data Evaluation Support (DES) and Laboratory Quality Assurance/Quality Control Services (QA/QC).  A sources sought notice that outlined specific program details was previously released under the solicitation number shown above.  A fixed price contract with a one-year period of performance is contemplated.  This contract will be a one year “bridge” needed to synchronize the expiration of multiple contracts, after which, these requirements will be re-aligned to allow competitive procurement of as many tasks as practical.  This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  There are three primary circumstances that led to this determination.  (1) DES involves the operation and maintenance of numerous in-house systems developed for AFTAC's unique mission.  The majority of these systems are used and modified by several AFTAC directorates for their own unique purposes.  Ensco, Inc. is currently performing services for other directorates to modify and use these models on another contract.  It would not be practical or possible for two contractors to perform maintenance and modifications to these programs at the same time. (2) Technical analysis of the time required to learn and become proficient in the operation and maintenance of DES code and to become proficient in performing the in depth nuclear QA/QC services would require an extended phase in period that would lead to a substantial duplication of costs that would not be warranted given the one year duration of the anticipated contract.  (3) Other than the incumbent contractor, no firms currently possess the requisite experience and knowledge to perform the nuclear laboratory QA/QC function.  Future contracts for these services are being contemplated for FY06 and beyond.  It is anticipated that a significant portion of the AFTAC Data Evaluation Support services will be procured on a competitive basis at that time.  In order to promote competition for these services, the computer code for the DES software will be made available in the near future.  Interested firms may obtain a copy by contacting Ms. Michelle Raines at 321-494-7320.   Solicitation No. FA2521-04-R-0028 will be issued as a Request for Proposal.  This procurement will be conducted without set-aside, on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690 and the Small Business size standard is $6.0 million.  No solicitation documents exists at this time.  The 45th Contracting Squadron has determined that Ensco, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the necessary services.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort in its entirety should provide evidence of capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

This requires gathering background information on specific sites, obtaining soil and/or groundwater samples, installing monitoring wells, performing pilot studies as well as any other approved tasks deemed necessary to obtain the required information to determine the site geology and hydrology so that extent of contamination, evaluation of risks, and definition of appropriate remediation measures may be accomplished.  The A&E may be required to accomplish work incidental to site remediation.

The contract requires that the selected firm have an on-line access to E-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluations factors for all services.  Evaluation Factors (1) through (5) are of equal importance; factors (6) and (7) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

The A&E may be required to manage up to 50 different taskings concurrently at various stages of study and design over the life of this contract, and maintain schedules for the following services:  submit a final work plan 15 days after initial Notice to Proceed (NTP); and mobilize forces, complete testing on a single site, analyze results, and submit a report within 45 days after NTP.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of demonstrated long term business relationships and repeat business with Government and private customers, and performance awards/letters of recommendations received.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy in reports, to assure overall coordination between engineering and technical disciplines, their means of ensuring quality services from their consultant laboratories; and to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications.

6.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional one year periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $5,000,000 for the entire contract term.

There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Estimated start date is June 2005.  This proposed contract is being solicited as 100% set aside for small businesses; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all small business concerns.

Elvira Rd, Tucson, AZ 85706-7123 for a quantity of one (1) Dektak 8 Advanced Development Profiler.   The Dektak 8- ADP is a contact-stylus profiler that measures film thickness, surface roughness, stress and defects on samples as large as 200 mm in diameter.  Advanced tip geometries and low stylus force allow users to characterize challenging features and materials.  The Dektak 8-ADP is the only contact-stylus profiler that can measure three-inch-thick samples with a stylus force from 0.03 to 15 mg.  The Dektak 8-ADP has specifications that include:  a programmable 200mm x 200mm XY stage, programmable theta and motorized leveling, vacuum compatible 150 to 200mm wafer chuck, dual field of view optics, N-Lite low force LIS3 sensor for a stylus force range!  between 0.03 to 15 mg, extended sample height adjustment to 3 inches, vibration isolation table, Vision32 3D image and analysis software, step detection software, and computer hardware consisting of a controller with 512 MB RAM, 40 GB hard drive, CD-RW, 3.5-inch floppy, 17-inch LCD monitor and the latest version of Window XP operating system. Delivery of the items is FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 3 months after receipt of order.  Award will be issued under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR13.5). The requirement is limited to Veeco Tucson Inc. because the Dektak 8 ADP is the only contact-stylus profiler that can measure samples that are 3-inches thick and 200mm in diameter with a wide variety of styli from sub-micron styli to high aspect ratio styli and using very low stylus force of 0.03mg.  In addition, the Dektak 8- ADP is the only profiler that uses Window XP for data acquisition and analysis.  W! indow XP can store and access the very large amounts of data needed for the 3-dimensional-surface maps required by the government.  Any firm believing they can provide a contact-stylus profiler that can measure 3-inch-thick, 200mm-diameter samples using a wide variety of styli from sub-micron styli to high aspect ratio styli and a very low stylus force of 0.03mg may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than ten (10) days after this notification is published.

<DESC>The National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) is interested in establishing a National Stem Cell Bank (NSCB).  The NSCB will acquire, store, characterize and distribute the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines currently approved for federal funding, as listed on the NIH Stem Cell Registry (http://stemcells.nih.gov/research/registry/).  The NSCB will consolidate the approved hESC lines in one location, will maintain uniform quality control and will reduce the costs that researchers pay for the cell lines.  Specifically, the NSCB will:  1) Test the hESC lines in regard to basic characteristics such as karyotypic stability, molecular markers, pluripotency, etc; 2) Characterize patterns of gene expression in the various lines; 3) Determine the capacity to differentiate into specific cell types; 4) Standardize methods for obtaining stable subclones; 5) Develop standardized quality control assays; 6) Provide technical service and training for researchers; 7) Distribute the cells at nominal cost with minimal intellectual property barriers; 8) Make all data publicly available through a website; 9) Coordinate with other entities currently working with approved hESC lines.  The NCRR anticipates that the activities of the NSCB will facilitate new investigations using the approved hESC lines, leading to advances in basic knowledge and enhanced opportunities for translational research.  The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on a cost reimbursement, incrementally funded basis, for a period of four (4) years.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.  This solicitation will be available electronically on or about December 16, 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan has a requirement field aging and end-of-life emission testing on 8 small (<6hp) spark-ignited lawnmower engines, 4 of which are equipped with prototype catalysts.  The engines shall be aged up to 100 hours, followed by emission testing on 12 engine configurations, with the catalyst-equipped engines being tested with and without the catalysts.  The basic emission testing shall consist of 3 emission tests per engine.  An optional fourth test may be conducted depending on the results of a statistical test based on the initial 3 tests.  EPA will provide the 8 engines as well as the garden tractor and hydraulic test rig to be used for the field aging.  The grass cutting shall be conducted at a Contractor-selected site on grass which is 5 to 7 inches in height, with daytime ambient mowing temperatures of at least 60F. The subsequent emission testing shall be conducted at the Contractor's test facility based on the existing Phase 2 EPA regulated emission test cycle (40 CFR Part 90).   The engines are to be tested for HC, NMHC, NOx, CO, and CO2, with results reported in g/kWh.  The Contractor shall also collect and measure particulate matter (PM) samples for the 3 base tests per engine.  A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated.  In addition to price, the Government's evaluation of proposals will address each offeror's technical approach and past performance record.  All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price.  The anticipated contract performance period is approximately 10 weeks after contract award.  The solicitation will be released through the internet on EPA's home page at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Prospective offerors can download the Request for Proposals and related documents from this website on or about December 9, 2004.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Paulo Roberto Lima Haro dos Anjos, Consultor Senior, Segurança, Meio Ambiente e Saúde, Petrobras Abastecimento, Av. República do Chile, 65 - 21° andar – Sala 2101, 20031-912 – Centro – Rio de Janeiro – RJ – BRASIL, Phone: 011-55-21-2534-6079; Fax: 011-55-21-2534-1392.  .  Petrobras Refinery Fire Control Upgrades, Standards, and Training Project.  Petrobras (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to carry out technical assistance for the Petrobras Refinery Fire Control Upgrades, Standards, and Training Project.

Brazil’s state-owned Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) is an integrated company active in exploration, production, refining, commercialization, and transport of oil and its derivatives in Brazil and abroad.  In 2000 Petrobras created the Program for Excellence in Environmental Management and Operational Safety (PEGASO) with the objective of reducing environmental and safety risks. Since that time, Petrobras has invested over US$2 billion in environmental and operational safety projects.  Petrobras currently operates 11 refineries in Brazil and three abroad with a total yield of 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd).  In addition, the downstream unit of Petrobras is in the process of upgrading and expanding the capacity of five of its refineries in Brazil.  As part of Petrobras’s 2003-2007 strategic plan, Petrobras will invest US$7.9 billion to upgrade and expand its refinery capacity.  These expansion projects and new refineries will use a higher percentage of domestic crude than the current mix which, in turn, will require higher risk processes such as delayed coking, hydrotreating, fluid catalytic cracking that will require a high degree of fire control in the refinery design process.  Petrobras’s Safety, Health, and Environment Department (SEH) is seeking to develop a set of uniform standards for fire control systems and training which all Petrobras refineries (and new refinery projects) will be required to meet.  

The objective of the USTDA funded-technical assistance is to develop a comprehensive plan to upgrade fire control and process safety at Petrobras refineries, develop new standards (based on U.S. and international standards) for fire control installations at existing and new refinery projects, and to develop a training program for refinery personnel.  The main tasks can be summarized as follows:

Task 1:  Data Collection and Orientation
Task 2:  Evaluate Petrobras Refinery Control Systems
Task 3:  Recommend Actions to Upgrade and Improve Existing Refineries’ Fire Control 
  Safety Systems
Task 4:  Develop New Standards and Procedures for Existing and New Refineries
Task 5:  Organize Training Seminar at Petrobras
Task 6:  Assess Petrobras Emergency Preparedness and Fire Safety Training Program
Task 7:  Identify Necessary Equipment, Technology and Services
Task 8:  Identify the Order of Magnitude of Project Costs
Task 9:  Prepare Technical Assistance Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $630,864 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and background definitional mission and desk study reports are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 PM, January 10, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, (CMS) intends to award, under Simplified Acquisitions Procedures, on a sole source basis a firm fixed price award to Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc. (Inforum), P.O. Box 451, College Park, Maryland  20740.  The purpose of this project is for Contractor to provide CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) consulting services associated with the following activities: (1) Support for Medicare Technical Panel work.  Contractor will provide consulting services in support of CMS work regarding the 2004 Medicare Technical Panel recommendations.  This support will include running long term simulations of the economy using the Long Term Interindustry Forecasting Tool (LIFT), a detailed interindustry6 macroeconomic model.  (2)  Support for CMS research on long term modeling. Contractor will investigate the feasibility of implementing medical sector equations similar to the CMS 10-year NHE model into LIFT.  This would make LIFT simulations more consistent with the CMS short term projections.  (3) Population projections.  At present, LIFT and the Demographic Projections Model (DPM) are based on Census Bureau population concepts.  Contractor will investigate the feasibility of building DPM with population data from the Social Security Administration.  (4)  Medicare simulations. Contractor will investigate improving the handling of Medicare in LIFT to address benefits and premiums.  For recent CMS simulations, benefits were specified as a share of GDP or as share of aggregate medical spending.  The contractor is uniquely qualified for three reasons:  (1) Long term interindustry, input-output based detail is unique.  CMS OACT requires the capability to construct detailed long term interindustry forecasts.  The LIFT model is unique among large scale models of the U.S. economy with respect to its interindustry detail.  The model is based on an input-output core, and builds up macroeconomic forecasts from the bottom up.  As noted above, LIFT is a proprietary model of Inforum.  (2) Inforum has developed a LIFT feature that permits CMS and Inforum economists to modify and/or override the LIFT equations or exogenous assumptions.  CMS economists have already invested considerable time in learning how to use this capability.  Again, this feature (that is, ability for the user override the model equations in the context of a long term projection tool) is a feature that is unique to LIFT.  (3)  Inforum economists have worked closely with CMS staff for several years on various long term forecasting projects using the LIFT model.  A specific example, noted above, is Inforum’s work on integrating the CMS computable general equilibrium, (CGE) model results.  The current contract extends off this existing work.  CMS is developing a more complicated version of its CGE model and we will again need to incorporate the CGE results into a detailed industry model.  Even if another suitable model existed (i.e., a model that included the capability to  make 75+ year forecasts with input-output based interindustry detail, and the capability to implement user-specific modifications to the basic model).  CMS economists would have to retrain the new contractor on the CMS model and CMS economists would have to relearn a new modeling system.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements, which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the requirements in this synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

Installation: Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Location: Fort Campbell, Kentucky occupies over 105,000 acres on the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville, KY and Clarksville, TN.  Although nearly two-thirds of the post is actually in Tennessee, the post office is located in Kentucky, and the identification lies within that state. 

Installation Description:  The United States Army opened Camp Campbell in 1942 as a temporary site for performing military training operations.  The camp was named in honor of William Bowen Campbell, a Tennessee statesman and Brigadier General of the United States Volunteers during the Civil War.  In April of 1950, the post was declared a permanent installation and re-designated as Fort Campbell.  Since then, the fort has hosted the U.S. Army Training Center and headquarters; participated in military operations in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Iraq, and Afghanistan; supported humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda and Somalia; and supplied peacekeepers to Haiti and Bosnia.  The fort’s mission is “to support training, mobilization, and deployment of mission-ready forces.”  It strives “to provide services, facilities, and a safe and secure environment for our soldiers, civilians, retirees, veterans and their families, while transforming for the future.”

Fort Campbell is currently home to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), nicknamed “Screaming Eagles”, as well as Division Artillery, Division Support Command, the 101st Aviation Brigade, the 159th Aviation Brigade, the 101st Corps Support Group, and a number of other separate commands.  Activities on the fort include field training exercises, aviation activities, live-fire qualification and training, special operations maneuver training, and administrative and support activities.  Facilities on post include the Campbell and Sabre Army Airfields, the Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, recreational activities, historical museums, and other community support activities.

Today, the installation’s total population includes 26,500 active duty personnel, 3,900 civil servants, and 58,200 family members.  In addition, the fort supports 138,400 veterans and retirees.  The number of active duty personnel fluctuates as much as 50% depending on deployment status.  The total population is scheduled to increase in the near future due to military unit restructuring.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.  Electric System Description:  The Fort Campbell electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation defined by Section J01.10 of this section or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The system may include, but is not limited to transformers, underground and overhead circuits, utility poles, switches, streetlights, and vaults (traffic lights are not included in this contract).  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description. Under no circumstances shall the successful Contractor be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.

The installation shall retain joint use of all electrical utility poles.

All transformers have had all polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s) removed. 

Primary power enters the installation at four locations.  Power transmission lines carrying 69 kV enter the fort from Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) on the east side off of Route 41A.  An alternate 69 kV power feed and new substation (called Screaming Eagle) are being constructed near Gate 10.  Upon completion, the substation will be owned by TVA. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation (CEMC) supplies 14.4 kV power at Range 28 and Range 29. They also supply 7.2 kV to the landfill, however CEMC owns and maintains the lines serving the landfill, so this area will not be included in the contract.  Pennyrile Rural Electric Cooperative (Pennyrile) supplies 14.4 kV to Range 46.  There is an off-site location called Red River where there is an emergency water pump station.  Power commodity is provided to this area by Clarksville Department of Electricity (CDE).  

There are approximately 14 miles of 69 kV transmission line and seven substations.  In addition, there are approximately 264 miles of distribution line and 7 substations.  The fort is in the midst of a $10 million upgrade to its electrical transmission and distribution system that is scheduled to be complete by April 2005.  Average monthly consumption is approximately 20.9 million kilowatt hours with usage peaking in late summer to early fall.  Emergency generators will remain under the ownership of the installation.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the Electric Distribution System.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Christine Bond Jawish at 703-767-3298 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission Asia, Afghanistan Procurement Support Office, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from organizations interested in implementing a project for USAID/Afghanistan entitled the Alternative Livelihoods Program, a major component of the U.S. Government’s assistance to the Government of Afghanistan’s (GOA) counter-narcotics strategy.

The principal goal of the Alternative Livelihoods Program (ALP) is to accelerate broad based, sustainable rural economic development in ways that provide new opportunities to encourage the Afghan population to seek livelihoods in the licit economy.

The project is anticipated to consist of 2 major objectives: 1) Help accelerate licit economic growth and business activity development in selected provinces in which poppy cultivation is thriving; and 2) Help provide an immediate alternative source of income to poor households whose livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on the temporary opium economy.

A draft Scope of Work and Evaluation Criteria have been issued for comment on the FedBizOps website and can be accessed via the following link (http://www1.eps.gov/spg/AID/OM/AFG/postdatePrevDays_1.html).

The period of performance is expected to be three years. Currently USAID estimates the cost of this program to be $330 million with approximately $250 million to be allocated to programmatic implementation. 

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about December 8, 2004. The RFP will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on the website along with the RFP.

Potential offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically. Interested vendors are invited to register on the Interested Vendors List module, particularly those interested in teaming and/or subcontracting opportunities.  Questions regarding this pre-solicitation notice should be directed to Kyle Newkirk (knewkirk@usaid.gov) in the USAID Regional Development Mission Asia, Afghanistan Procurement Support Office.

<DESC>UPDATE (12-1-04) REVISED FINAL RFP POSTED A revised copy of the Final RFP has been posted. The documents are now in the  proper order and several "Draft" notations have been removed.  No other changes  have been made to the document.  Please note that this is a huge file, and may  not open in your browser window in a timely manner.  You may need to save the  file to your computer prior to reviewing the documentation. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-30-04) FINAL RFP RELEASE The final RFP is hereby released.  Please note Section L was accidently  duplicated and there are two identical file copies.  In addition, the document  sections, most notably, the PCO letters, are out of order due to software  glitches. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-05-04) SECTION L AND M, CLINs and SECTION H POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the Sections L, M, and H and the  CLINs and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at  your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 11 Nov 2004.  If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below.

If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (10-20-04) Change in Pricing Strategy The first draft Request for Proposal (RFP) stated that the pricing structure  for the contract will be 5 years firm-fixed-price (FFP), 3 years fixed price  with economic price adjustment (FP/EPA), and 2 years Not to Exceed (NTE).  As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

<DESC>RFP RELEASE - The Request for Proposal for the US NDC Phase 3 has been released.  The RFP and all applicable documents including RFP attachments have  been posted to the PIXS web site.  Responses to the RFP are due 25 Jun 2004.   Questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Nancy Williamson, 321- 494-1795, nancy.williamson@patrick.af.mil. INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE The US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day is scheduled for 23 January 2004.  This virtual  industry day is open to all interested parties.  Representatives from  Contracting, Program Management, and Requirements will be available to take  questions.  Interested parties must sign up for the US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day  on the MarketSpace website, https://www.mrpc.wpafb.af.mil/mktspace/ not later  than close of business 21 January 2004.  After logging in to the MarketSpace  website with your e-mail address (you will need to create a password if you are  a new user), click on "Register for an Event" in the left hand column.  Select  the US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day - 1/23/04 and click on "Register."  This  completes the registration process on the MarketSpace website. The Government  team will then notify each interested party with further instructions including  website and login instructions.  During Industry Day each participant will  login during their alloted 30 minute segment of time to ask questions or  provide comments.   PRE-SOLICITATION  NOTICE 1.  The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date. Contact Information:  Ms. Nancy Williamson, Contracting Officer, ASC/RAKPM,  321.757.1795,  e-mail: nancy.williamson@ patrick.af.mil.

The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysupgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date.

Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide clarification of the following points related to the original BAA:  

1) Provide a strategy and architectural framework for interoperability with existing legacy communications (e.g. dispatch) and information management systems (e.g.
GIS) in current use in incident command and emergency management. Include support of commonly used and accepted standards as well as systems.
2) The UICDS architecture has both information management and communications aspects. A proposal should address both aspects.
3) Any anticipated restrictions on supplied or utilized intellectual property should be stated. The Government expects that a UICDS architecture will be open and nonproprietary.
4) In addressing collaboration in a UICDS architecture, issues of information/data discovery, invitation, access control and multi-level security must be addressed.
5) HSARPA provides a teaming portal via www.hsarpabaa.com that enables teams to be formed. Teams looking for complementary partnerships should use this portal.
6) Organizations/teams should contain subject matter experts in incident command and emergency management as well as information management and communications.
7) Proposals must address satisfaction of the NIMS requirements. The focus should be on ICS (Incident Command System) and MACS (Multiagency Coordination System) and on communications and information management. Cognizance should be taken of other NIMS requirements.

<DESC>Amendment 0017 "This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at <http://www.eps.gov/> and the Navy Electronic Commerce On Line (NECO) site located at <http://www.neco.navy.mil>/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane." This is Amendment 0017 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A)  The above closing date (22 December 2004) is applicable only to those offerors with whom the Government has conducted negotiations for the Rail Interface System (RIS).  The solicitation's Item Numbers for the RIS are 0021, 0022, 0023, 0024 and 0033. B)  This amendment is issued to notify the applicable RIS offerors that the Government shall accept and evaluate revised proposals for the RIS.  The revised offers for the RIS may include revisions to technical proposals for the RIS model(s) previously proposed.  Additional product samples, however, are not requested and will not be evaluated.  The acceptance period for proposal revisions for the RIS shall be valid until 22 February 2005.  Tele-faxed proposal revisions are allowed (FAX number is 812-854-5095). C)  Additionally, in Paragraph 3.3.1.5.1 of the Performance Specification, the first paragraph following Table 6 is replaced by the paragraph and note shown below.  (The revised area of this paragraph and the note have been put in bold type.) The current and future systems that mount in the 6:00 position will require improved or alternative versions of Rail Interface System (RIS) or Rail Attachment System (RAS) forearm rails.  This is required in order to mount the EGLM and the other 6:00 systems to the M4A1 Carbine without interfering with the natural vibrations of the carbine barrel, as well as allowing use of current SOPMOD aiming accessories.  Sought are improved/alternative versions the RIS/RAS that will allow the operator to mount and remove the future EGLM and other 6:00 systems in a field environment.  A rigid or monolithic interface system is desired that will allow a free-floating carbine barrel, withstand the shock of firing all currently fielded 40mm rounds, and maintain zero repeatability when removed and remounted.  While MIL-STD-1913 rails are still required in the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 positions on the rifle/carbine forearm, alternative intermediate or supplemental interfaces will be conside! red to allow the EGLM and other 6:00 subsystems to be mounted as closely to the carbine barrel as possible without touching it.  Vendors offering any alternative intermediate or supplemental interfaces between the RIS and the M4A1 carbine and/or any SOPMOD accessories (including grenade launchers) shall provide the intellectual property rights as set forth by CDRL A010. (Note:  Paragraph 3.1.2.1 of this Performance Specification is not applicable to the RIS.  Additionally, the first two sentences of Paragraph 3.5.1 of this Performance Specification are not applicable to the RIS.) D)  Furthermore, Block #'s 5., 12., 13. and 16. of CDRL #A010 have been revised (see attached CDRL #A010). E)  Revised proposals for the solicitation's remaining Item Numbers shall be addressed in upcoming amendments. F)  All other terms and conditions in the solicitation remain the same.  Offers shall be delivered to:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Building 2521, Attn:  Don Ellison, Code 0562, 300 Highway 361, NSWC Crane IN, 47522-5001.  All required information must be received on or before 22 December 2004, 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program on or about 01 Feb 05.  The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate fellowships to U.S. citizens who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering.  Preference is given to applicants who indicate an intention to pursue a doctoral degree in science, math, and engineering (SME) discipline.  NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with an accredited program in the appropriate SME discipline.  Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military obligation.  The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the institution of choice.  Each application will be evaluated and ranked by a disciplinary panel of academic experts from the science and engineering discipline of the applicant’s proposed advanced degree program.  Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services:  the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research.  The current stipend amount starts at $30,500, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year.  The present contract (F49620-02-C-0041) was awarded in August 2002.  The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants’ stipends and academic fees.  The present contract’s period of performance for the pass through funding is scheduled to end July 2005.  AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract.  AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program.  The successful offeror will be required to work with the incumbent contractor, as necessary, to smoothly transition administration of the program, as well as be required to transition administration of the contract to a successor contractor when the contract performance period ends.  Functions required to administer the program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  advertising the NDSEG Fellowship program; soliciting qualified applicants; collect and receipt of applications in a secure electronic (online) format; distribution of applications among the disciplinary panels for evaluation to the three participating DoD services for selection; making offers of appointment to selected applicants and notifying unsuccessful applicants; administering payment of stipends to Fellows and payment of tuition and required fees to institutions; gathering and maintaining data, suitable for analysis and presentations, from current and former participants and unsuccessful applicants; organize a yearly NDSEG conference.  DoD anticipates awarding a minimum of one hundred (100) and a maximum of three hundred (300) new three-year NDSEG Fellows each fiscal year subject to the availability of funds.  AFOSR anticipates a contract with a potential length of seven years to cover five Fellowship classes.  Under the proposed contract, the administration provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement, while the pass through funds for students’ stipends, tuition and fees will be through a Cost Reimbursable arrangement.  The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $5.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  Interested sources are requested to provide a concise capability statement, limited to three pages, addressing past three years of experience relevant to the above described functions, to include:  experience in similar programs; knowledge of appropriate means to publicize the program and recruit participants; familiarity with issues related to conducting research in science and engineering; ability to attract university faculty members of the science and engineering community to serve on evaluation panels; cost accounting and financial management systems adequate to track costs, issue stipends and pay academic expenses; database management capabilities to gather and maintain data; and other resources necessary to conduct a program of this magnitude in a timely manner.  Reference to past customers for similar services should include organization name, point of contact name and telephone number.  Capability statements will be screened using the above described capabilities to identify qualified sources.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide capability statements no later than 17 Dec 04 to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Joseph Williams, at AFOSR/PK4, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Virginia 22203-1977; or fax (703) 696-6240.

<DESC>The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy’s (USMMA’s) Department of Marine Engineering has been authorized to offer a graduate program and appropriate degree in Marine Engineering. Program admissions will begin shortly, and the first cohort of students is expected to begin their graduate studies in November 2005. Students admitted to the program will be attending classes by synchronous Distance Learning. 
 
In order to provide the faculty with experience in classroom instruction using synchronous Distance Learning technologies, the USMMA anticipates a competitive selection of a product and service provider (i.e., a single entity) by not later than the spring of 2005. Initial use of a synchronous Distance Learning service will begin in that same timeframe, and continue in limited use throughout Calendar Year 2005 until classes in the Marine Engineering program begin in November 2005. Faculty will conduct hybrid on-campus synchronous instruction in selected courses in the undergraduate programs of Marine Engineering. This early use will permit faculty teaching in the Naval Architecture degree program the opportunity to acquire and refine their synchronous class planning, class management, and class administration skills.
 
It is anticipated that six-to-eight faculty at a given time will eventually participate in the Marine Engineering degree program. Some faculty members will teach at least one elective undergraduate course using the synchronous Distance Learning course prior to their first teaching assignment in the graduate degree program.
 
The USMMA is interested in identifying combinations of products and service providers which will meet the needs of conducting synchronous classroom education in its forthcoming graduate program in Marine Engineering. Any potential source shall identify its capabilities in relation to the required supplies and services AND whether those supplies and services can be provided under existing Federal Supply Schedules.  Those needs can be categorized as follows:
 
[1] Appropriate Protocols, Web Enabled Products with an Appropriate Visual Metaphor
[2] Service Providers with Sufficient Internet Bandwidth and Continuation of Operations Capabilities
[3] Course Material Storage for Forthcoming/Current Classes
[4] Course Material Storage for Past Class Sessions
[5] Student Help Desk Support
[6] Course Production Assistants and Assistance
 

APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS, WEB ENABLED PRODUCTS with an APPROPRIATE  VISUAL METAPHOR --

The product must support H.323 and T.120 protocols, or other acceptable Internet protocols, that offer voice/audio, whiteboard, application sharing, and if needed, video communication. 
 
The product must be supported entirely by a web client operating on recent versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Mozilla's Firefox web browsers. The product must provide an effective, easy-to-learn visual metaphor for the conduct of synchronous learning and participation. Faculty members must be able to call for questions among the students, identify students with questions, restrict the ability to put forth questions, and to select students whose questions s/he wishes to accept. Transcripts of text message exchanges must exist. Faculty must be able to edit transcripts and organize subsets of the transcripts in a manner chosen.
 
Students and faculty must be able to converse through audio and text messaging services. When required, video communications must not "crowd out" audio and text communications.
 
SERVICE PROVIDERS with SUFFICIENT INTERNET BANDWIDTH and CONTINUATION of OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES --
 
Students and faculty will be connecting to the Internet via commercial service providers, or the USMMA network, with DSL, cable modems, or corporate LANS.
 
The service provider offering this product must have operations supported from 9:00am to 10pm EST , Monday through Thursday --except for Federal Holidays. Service Providers must have Internet access of at least an OC3 connection, and at no time during the conduct of a USMMA course can the aggregate demand of the Academy's students and faculty meet or exceed 10% of the Service Provider's connection bandwidth.
 
Service Providers must have an alternate site to support their operations in the event the primary site is compromised and cannot function acceptably. The alternate site must provide the same bandwidth support as the primary site.
 

COURSE MATERIAL STORAGE for FORTHCOMING/CURRENT CLASSES --
 
The Service Provider must provide each instructor with a minimum of 50GB of storage for each week's classes. The instructor must have full read/write, directory, cut-and-paste, drag-and-drop, administrative privileges, and a visual metaphor for the file system, like that found in Microsoft XP Professional. All file storage must be replicated at least nightly to ensure a minimum loss of data in the event of a storage failure. Restoring lost files and data must take place on demand, and not exceed one hour from the time the request is made by the instructor.
 

COURSE MATERIAL STORAGE PAST CLASS SESSIONS -- 
 
The Service Provider must retain the directory structure, folders, and all files for completed class sessions for a period of not less than 15 weeks. At the end of 15 weeks, all course materials are to be transferred to DVD/CD and provided to the USMMA.
 

STUDENT HELP DESK SUPPORT --
 
The Service Provider must offer toll-free access to a Student Help Desk that is staffed an hour before each class session, during the class session, and one hour following the end of each class session. Help Desk Staff must be trained to provide support for Internet connection issues and PC configuration issues. There must be a Help Desk web site, and the web site must support incident reporting, publishing current performance metrics, and hosting a relevant FAQ list.
 

COURSE PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS and ASSISTANCE --
 
The Service Provider must provide each class session with a trained staff member to assist the class instructor.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.
	THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.


The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The United States House of Representatives (USHR) is soliciting industry for commercially available products that can provide an integrated technological solution for accounting for building occupants immediately following building evacuations and, during the immediate 24-hour period thereafter, the status of all House building occupants (Members, staff, contractors/vendors and visitors). 

USHR is seeking contemporary information and current state-of-the-art mechanisms that provide a reliable, robust, and rapid accumulation of real-time operationally accessible data concerning the status of evacuated personnel:

1.	who have gathered in assembly areas;
2.	who are dislocated from the Capitol campus during evacuation events but need to report their status;
3.	who have traveled or are in transit to a secondary location, or are out of the local area and need to report their status.

Additionally, proposed solutions should provide a real-time, 3-D graphical, GIS display of building evacuation/occupancy for Incident Commanders and Emergency Operations Center staff.

Due to the sensitive nature of data being collected, data security is absolutely essential for any product to be considered acceptable.

For the purpose of this request, the USHR desires that a two-phased approach to the accountability process be examined:

The overall purpose of this approach is to provide timely information to law enforcement and USHR officials as to building evacuation status and relative safe-status of employees, for use in tactical and strategic decision making by these officials during emergency conditions.   Such data (Phase 1) may also be used by first responder personnel to assist in determining the percentage of employees “accounted for,” building-by-building, and assist these responders in the use of on-scene emergency resources.

Phase 1:  (Short term accountability / building empty status) Systems and mechanisms that assist in identifying and accounting for staff who have evacuated the building.  This phase, and the systems and mechanisms being sought, should achieve comprehensive accountability/status reports within sixty (60) minutes of the evacuation event.  This should include input to a 3-D or graphical display of the affected building by room and floor, showing the status of evacuation and/or check-in of personnel based on where they reside in the building.

Phase 2:  (Long term / 100 % accountability) Systems and mechanisms that assist in recalculating and augmenting the ‘Phase 1” system, which, within a 24-hour period of time, accepts input from varying sources (telephone calls; email or web-based responses, etc.) and refines initial reporting to provide a complete picture of the status of all USHR building occupants. 

USHR is located in downtown Washington, DC.  The facilities housing USHR consist of 4 main office buildings, the United States Capitol building, and other smaller buildings clustered in an urban area encompassing an area of 0.8 square miles.  Approximately 13,500 employees work for the USHR within these facilities.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 15 February 05 to Emily Tuck  Office of Procurement  359 Ford House Office Building  Washington, DC  20515  Emily.Tuck@mail.house.gov  .  There is no specific limitation on overall maximum volume/size of submittals.  With regard to all submittals, an executive summary of no more than 12 pages should be included.  Details of individual systems described should be no more than 4 pages.  Submittals should include examples of systems currently available to support the above specified operations, to include known locations where they are in use.  Multiple systems may be proposed to meet the various needs specified, if appropriate.  For currently available systems, proposals should include an estimate of lifecycle costs to include separate specification of purchase, implementation and maintenance costs.  New design efforts to meet the needs may be submitted; however, currently available systems are preferred.

A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USHR will not release any information – marked with a Proprietary legend – received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Legislative Branch of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for all qualified sources for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work which will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy.  Respondents should address each of these capabilities.  The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires support services to assist in determining the adequacy and integrity of information and physical security implemented and operated by entities regulated by the SEC and/or their contract service providers.  Regulated entities, as defined by the Securities Act of 1934 (ACT) and rules promulgated under it, include self-regulatory organizations, national securities exchanges, securities information processors, clearing agencies, electronic communication networks (ECNs), and alternative trading systems (ATSs).  Other regulated entities defined in the ACT are excluded from the support described in this Request for Information (RFI).  Qualified organizations would provide support to (1) evaluate management assertions that categorize and describe information, information systems, inherent risks, external risks, and controls to mitigate risks; (2) identify and evaluate the logical and physical security architecture and test the security controls for physical perimeters and information systems (processing platforms, operating systems, and application systems) and their associated private and public networks (extranets, Internet, web services, public-key infrastructure, firewalls, routers, switches, and other network-enabling equipment and servers); (3) verify the effectiveness of security controls and determine the existence of vulnerabilities without compensating controls to minimize risk; and (4) evaluate management assertions regarding operational authorization for processing (security accreditation) of information systems and their associated networks.  The SEC envisions at least annual assessment of regulated entities and indeterminate (ad hoc) additional assessments.  SEC is requesting input in the form of capability statements.  Interested parties must submit brief but complete capability statements that address their qualifications, national business locations, certifications, federal security clearances, and licenses to perform the support services described in this RFI.  Each respondent must identify the geographical areas and cities in which they currently perform such work within the United States.  The SEC may require the use of standards published by other financial regulatory agencies, but respondents may suggest the use of financial industry standards and best practices in use in the United States for identifying their approach to baseline and benchmark evaluations.  Capability statements are to be submitted not later than January 4, 2005. The capability statement shall address each of the areas identified above, demonstrate the company’s capability to perform these tasks, and identify and describe previous service contracts with financial organizations for security-related assessments, and the standards it used as the basis for the work performed. Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type, and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length. This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Space Plug-and-play Avionics Testbed Simulator / Stimulator (SPATSS)
<SOLNBR>SPATSS-01
<ARCHDATE>02282005
<CONTACT>William Foster, Contracting Officer, Phone 505-846-5935, Fax 505-846-6022, Email william.foster@kirtland.af.mil - Gregory Hall, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-846-7201, Fax 505-846-7049, Email gregory.hall@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>Title: Space Plug-and-play Avionics Testbed Simulator / Stimulator (SPATSS)

Narrative:

AFRL has been engaged in the research and development of concepts for modular, plug-and-play avionics architecture.  Our motivation is to build systems in the most rapid time possible.  It takes 5 years minimum and sometimes more than 15 to build a major space system, from thought to orbit. We believe that under the right "framework", even the most complex systems could be assembled and fielded in phenomenally short timeframes, perhaps days.  Most of the barriers to this goal are: 

(1) wiring harnesses, 
(2) software, 
(3) human fallibility,
and (4) closed, proprietary "standards".  

As such, AFRL is working with government and industry organizations to create a Space Plug-and-play Avionics (SPA) approach and standard.  SPA supports a modular, building block strategy in which each component of a spacecraft has built-in intelligence to promote a "plug-and-play" (PnP) paradigm.  With SPA, every spacecraft component, from the simplest thermometer to the most complex camera payload, is ideally integratable very rapidly, much like the USB "thumb drive" is rapidly recognized when plugged into a PC. 

( The ideas of SPA directly evolved from previous work on conceptual development projects such as the Adaptive Avionics Experiment (AAE).  Publically-released documentation are cited as references at the end of this solicitation.  Further documentation can be made available to US citizens through written/e-mail request. )

This idea of SPA has led to the requirement for a real-time spacecraft simulation to support several hardware in the loop (HWIL) testbeds.  The purposes of the testbed are: (1) to validate PnP avionics; (2) to understand rapid assembly concepts; and (3) to permit mission simulation / emulation.  

The testbeds have a need for a variety of programmable stimuli and emulation capabilities, including modular, detailed, six degree-of-freedom simulation that can provide realistic inputs to and receive data from satellite systems in development. The simulation should  be built from detailed hardware oriented component models.  Current baseline components that could be included are:  deployment pyro control, inertial stellar compass, solar array control & battery charger, star tracker, lightband (launch vehicle separation) interface, reaction wheel, GPS, command & telemetry radio, thrusters, heaters, temperature sensors, sun sensor array, magnetometer, IMU, and torque rod.  The simulation much have an open architecture to support models that are developed at different times by different teams.

The simulation must support the HWIL environment.  This includes the conversion of model data to HWIL plug compatible component emulation such that spacecraft data handling systems will believe a real device is connected.  In addition, the simulation must also support the dynamic conversion of HWIL data inputs to model parameters for inclusion in the real-time simulation.  The simulation must support a varying mixture of physical hardware components and purely simulated components.

The overall real-time simulation must easily accept new models of specific or generic components.  The simulation must have a user friendly GUI for assembling the simulation from available models, parameterizing the models, and specifying the mission parameters such as orbit, ground contacts, 
etc.  The simulation must have a real-time graphical interface for displaying simulation data such as user-selected simulation parameters and spacecraft position and orientation.

AFRL is considering funding research in this specific technology area and is attempting to gauge industry / academic interest and capability. Responses should be sent to:  Air Force Research Laboratory/VSSE, Attn: SPATSS, 3550 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776.  Written and e-mailed responses are acceptable.  E-mail information to a protected USAF server: microsys@kirtland.af.mil. The information can be in the form of white papers, presentations, or proposals.  This industry survey does not obligate the government in any manner for any future acquisitions.  This is not a notice of intent to contract.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Qualified participants are invited to submit/demonstrate their interests and capability in writing.  Only detailed written  responses, received within thirty (30) days after the publication of this announcement will be reviewed.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to pursue  this effort.

<DESC>In June of 2004, Central Commands (CENTCOM) Commander identified an operational need to defeat the IED threat encountered during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  RCIEDs are one aspect of this threat.  To date, various quick reaction capability materi el solutions have been employed that disrupt/prevent certain classes of RCIED threats, but not all and not simultaneously.  A next generation one system is required to enable continued success against this pervasive, adaptive threat.  To initiate the nex t phase, Project Manager Signals Warfare (PM SW) and Product Director, Warlock Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) Devices will host an Industry Day II on 14 and 15 Dec, 2004.  This is a follow-up to the much broader, all encompassing Joint IED Defeat Task F orce (JIEDD TF) sponsored Industry Outreach Day conducted on 18 Nov, 2004 at Ft Belvoir.  The Industry Day II session will focus on specific acquisition and technical details with respect to current CREW device requirements and future planning.   Scope - Recognizing the adaptive nature of the threat and the need to provide rapid capabilities to the field, an evolutionary acquisition approach is proposed that incrementally spirals out capabilities to the field.  The ongoing Spiral 1 effort is addres sing the immediate warfighter need by fielding various quick reaction capabilities.  These systems, however, have capability limitations.  Spiral 2 is the next phase, and is the specific focus of the CREW Industry Day.  It is our intent to solicit input fr om Industry on how best to achieve the following in Spiral 2: ·	Produce/field a universal One System that addresses the full spectrum of RCIED threats; ·	Deliver increased performance in frequency coverage and minimum protective radius distance; ·	Design a system that provides flexibility for future capability growth; ·	Provide a common training and supportability approach; ·	Achieve size, weight and power (SWAP) reductions; ·	Provide adequate production facilities to meet schedule and surge capacity needs ; and ·	Balance performance & sustainment needs with an affordable solution Follow-on CREW Spirals are envisioned, however, these will only be discussed in general terms. Objectives - The purpose of the CREW Industry Day is to facilitate open information exchange so that the Government can incorporate smart ideas into the upcoming Spiral 2 solicitation process.  The primary objectives of the Industry Day are to:  ·	Identify key Industry partners that can help meet the RCIED threat; ·	Provide industry with current information regarding the OIF threat; ·	Provide Industry details/receive feedback on the overall CREW spiral acquisition approach; ·	Provide Industry with information on the CREW Spiral 2 requirements; ·	Discuss technical approaches and Industry recommendations; and ·	Lay the groundwork to establish an effective mechanism for continuous information exchange Expected Outcome - There are five key CREW acquisition tenets that relate to expected outcomes: ·	The Target is Competition  Promotion of a Healthy Industrial Base ·	Demonstrated Performance and Technical Maturity ·	Design for Supportability  Common MMI, Training and Supportability ·	Program Affordability  Balanced Performance and Sustainment ·	Schedule  Rapid Fielding of Increase Capabilities to the Warfighter For additional information regarding registration, proposed agenda, directions and information on one-on-one sessions, please go to the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (ASFI IBOP) at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

***BEGIN 52.212-1 Addendum – Specific Instructions to Offerors ***

Background:  This instruction to offerors gives specific guidance to assist in the preparation of the proposal against the Performance of Work Statement for Technical Surveillance Training Services.

Proposal Page/Format Limitation:  Limit your proposal to the following:

(i)	10 Pages - Technical
(ii)	2 Pages – Resumes
(iii)	1 Page Per Agency – Past Performance (Up to three (3) Agencies)
(iv)	5 Pages – Sample Course of Instruction
(v)	Prices Per Schedule B

Other Information:  Skills and knowledge required:  Subject matter expertise in areas of training specified in the Performance of Work Statement with a sample course of instruction for this type of training.  The course of instruction shall indicate any validations (which agency) of the course in meeting the overall objectives.

Period of Performance:  Five (5) year period of performance from date of award.

*** BEGIN 52.212-2 ADDENDUM - EVALUATION FACTORS *** 

(1) The first phase of the evaluation will consist of a review of the submitted proposals to determine whether or not the proposals comply with all solicitation requirements identified in the Performance of Work Statement (PWS) section of the solicitation. Failure to meet all solicitation requirements may result in elimination from further evaluation and consideration.

(2) The second phase of the evaluation will be comprised of three areas: Technical, Past Performance, and Price. The Technical Area Criteria are:  Development/Implementation of Curriculum and Demonstration of Types of Training. Technical is more important than Past Performance.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are more important than price. Offerors must note the evaluation of development/implementation of curriculum and demonstration of types of training will be essentially a subjective assessment by the technical evaluators. 

Technical Evaluation:  

Curriculum Development/Implementation and Training Plans – 

a) Demonstrates and identifies experiences and core competencies with expertise in developing and 
implementing Programs of Instruction (POI) using adult education methodologies.  Of particular importance is expertise in technical surveillance tactics and strategies. 

      b) Demonstrates the Offeror’s strengths and ability to develop technical surveillance training  
      programs of instruction. 

c) Identifies a systematic plan to achieve course objectives within specified timelines and funding constraints

Demonstration of Types of Training – 

       a) Experiences, core competencies, tools, and proficient personnel expertise is demonstrated and identified to  
support the types of training stated in this solicitation. 

b) Examples of such training are discussed and demonstrated in enough detail in the proposals to indicate success.  

c) The information provided demonstrates unequivocally the Offeror's strengths and ability to conduct training in the area of technical surveillance.

(4) The Past Performance evaluation includes the Offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the Offeror's record of compliance with safety, environmental and security laws and regulations; and generally, the Offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers. 

(5) Although price is less important than the other evaluation factors, it is an important factor.  Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the requirements and risks inherent in the scope of work. In addition, Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the offer within the total price proposed by the offeror.

 Cost will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and a total evaluated price for the entire length of contract.  When evaluating cost, the Government will determine if: 

·	the proposed cost reasonable for work to be performed;
·	reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; and
·	is consistent with approaches contained in the Offeror's /technical proposal

(6) Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the factors set forth in this solicitation.

(7) Offerors must provide data that specifically addresses all requirements in this solicitation.

52.212-2 ADDENDUM TO EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a)   Basis for Award. (1) The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror 
whose proposal provides the best value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the major Areas, listed in descending order of importance:  Technical/Management, Past Performance, and Price.  The Technical/Management is significantly more important than Past Performance.  Past Performance is significantly more important than Price.  The Technical/ Management and Past Performance Areas when combined are significantly more important than Price.  Offerors are cautioned that a significant deficiency in any area, factor, sub-factor or element may be grounds for exclusion of the offeror’s proposal from further evaluation and consideration for award.  Mere parroting of the requirements without detailed explanation of how the requirements will be achieved is not acceptable.  The Areas and Factors are identified as follows:

(A)	AREA I – TECHNICAL/MANAGMENT:   Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2.  

FACTOR 1 –  Technical Approach
FACTOR 2 –  Management Approach  
		
(B)	 AREA II - PAST  PERFORMANCE. 

(C)	 AREA III – PRICE 
	 
(2)	EVALUATION APPROACH.  Each proposal will be evaluated on merit, best overall value to the 
government, price and other factors considered.  In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the government that might result from making only one award, particularly the risk to the Government from a technical integration, logistics and administrative cost perspective.
 

(A)	AREA I – TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT.  The Government will evaluate the extent to 
which the offeror’s technical/management proposal demonstrates a sound, practical methodology for satisfying the requirements stated in the solicitation.  Proposals that fail to meet the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements may be grounds for rejection of the entire proposal.  
	
(1)  FACTOR 1 -  TECHNICAL APPROACH - The Government will evaluate the extent to which the proposal demonstrates the ability of the offeror to meet the technical requirements established in the Performance Work Statement to include types of training and technical surveillance curriculum development.  In accordance with the requirements outlined in the PWS, both objective and subjective data will be collected in order to assess the technical surveillance training proposal for suitability and effectiveness.   

(a)	SUBFACTOR 1:  Types of Training (PWS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 
and 1.7):    Demonstrate training experience and knowledge in types of 
training. 


(b)	SUBFACTOR 2:  Technical Surveillance Curriculum Development (PWS 2.0, 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4).  All elements are of equal importance.

Element 1:  Demonstrate technical capability and expertise in developing curriculum for types of training outlined in Subfactor 1, Types of Training. 

Element 2:  Demonstrate technical capability and expertise in developing curriculum for hands-on training for technical surveillance tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).

Element 3:  Demonstrate understanding of curriculum requirements as stated in PWS 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.

(c)	SUBFACTOR 3:  Sample Program of Instruction (POI) -  The offeror shall 
submit a draft outline of a POI for the initial four (4) week training course.  The draft outline of the proposed POI for the initial course will be evaluated to see how well it demonstrates a full and complete understanding of the training requirements IAW the PWS.

		(2)  FACTOR 2 – MANAGEMENT APPROACH

(a)	Management.  The offeror’s ability to provide management support 
necessary for the successful accomplishment of technical surveillance training courses will be evaluated.  All elements are of equal importance.

Element 1: The adequacy of the offeror’s overall management organization, its methods of operation, and its techniques and system of controls to include methods for coordinating and organizing an efficient training course on short notice (less than four (4) weeks) will be assessed.

Element 2:  The offeror’s facility management practices for providing a safe and comfortable training environment IAW the PWS (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7)

Element 3: The Government will evaluate offeror’s proposed  methodology and processes for obtaining qualified instructors that have experience and/or education in areas of training specified in the PWS (8.0, 8.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, 8.1.3.1, 8.1.3.2, 8.1.3.3, 8.1.3.4, 8.1.3.5, and 8.2).  

Element 4:  The resumes of proposed instructors will be evaluated to determine the extent of training in subject areas, operational experience in the skill sets to be trained, relevant education and appropriate skill levels to develop and maintain the training material and teach the courses.  

Rating Methodology – The following color/adjectival ratings will be used for the rating assigned in the technical/management areas as appropriate.    
Color	Rating	Definition
Blue	Exceptional	Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Special Operations Command.
Green	Acceptable	Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.
Yellow	Marginal	Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance, but any proposal inadequacies are correctable.
Red	Unacceptable	Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable














(B)  AREA II:  PAST PERFORMANCE.

1)	Performance risk considers those risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation requirements as indicated by the offeror's record of past/current performance on relevant contracts.  The Performance Risk Assessment Group (PRAG) evaluation will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor’s performance of an offeror and all subcontractors/team members.  Proposals shall be evaluated to determine if the contracts and sources submitted for the prime and subcontractors/team members are current and relevant.   If no relevant historical or current data exists then the procedures of FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) will apply.  The Government will evaluate the Proposal and data from outside sources considering the following aspects:  Cost/Schedule Planning & Control, Quality Assurance, and Cooperation.  This includes the offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers.

2)	If the offeror has no relevant prior experience, a failure to state “No Experience” may cause the proposal to be excluded from further consideration for award.

3)   Rating Methodology for Past/Present Performance: A significant achievement, 
problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of work can become an important consideration in the source selection process.  A negative finding under any factor may result in an overall high-risk rating.  Therefore, offerors are reminded to include relevant past efforts, as described above, including demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal.  Each contract submitted by the offeror to substantiate past/present performance will first be rated for relevancy by the Government and a rating of Highly Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant or Not Relevant will be assigned.  This relevancy rating will be used when considering how much weight to ascribe to each contract.  Then Contract Performance Ratings will be ascribed to the Offeror's work on that contract as follows: Unsatisfactory, Marginal, Satisfactory, Very Good, or Exceptional.  After the Government considers all factors, a Final Performance Risk Assessment will be made for each offeror.  That assessment will be one of the following:

   PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT DEFINITIONS

High Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record, it is unlikely that the offeror willsuccessfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms and conditions the contract.
Moderate Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Low Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
Neutral Risk: The offeror has no recent, relevant performance information. (To receive a Neutral Risk Rating, the offeror must include the following statement: "The offeror has no relevant past/present performance." Otherwise, one of the other ratings will be applied, with the Government determining relevancy.  Failure to provide the required information may be treated as a deficiency in the Offeror's proposal.)


(C)  AREA III:  PRICE.  

1)	Completeness and Balanced Pricing.  The proposal will be evaluated to ensure that
ALL CLINS for which the offeror is submitting prices are completed.  All proposals will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing.  Offerors are cautioned that unbalanced unit prices may be grounds for exclusion of a proposal from consideration for award. 

2)	Price reasonableness shall be determined through competitive commercial market 
prices and IAW the guidelines set forth in FAR 15.404-1.   
 
3)	Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the  
requirements and risks inherent in the scope of work.  In addition, Price will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the offer within the total price proposed by the offeror.

4)	Price will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and a total evaluated price 
for the entire length of contract.  When evaluating cost, the Government will determine if: 

·	the proposed cost reasonable for work to be performed;
·	reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; and
·	is consistent with approaches contained in the Offeror's /technical proposal


(b)   Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the factors set forth in this solicitation.

(c)   Offerors must provide data that specifically addresses all requirements in this solicitation. 

52.216-18 Ordering (Oct 1995)
(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from date of contract award through 30 Sep 2009.
(b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.
(c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered “issued” when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.

52.216-19  Order Limitations (Oct 1995)
(a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $193,000.00, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract.
(b) Maximum order. The Contractor is not obligated to honor --

(3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within five (5) days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within two (2) days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor’s intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source.
(End of Clause)

52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<DESC>Questions and Answers

1.  I was also wondering as to what detail the sample site goes.  Is it possible to sign in and take a look and can you tell me if that information is indicative of what is wanted for the new site?

	The sample site only shows the home page, but is the fun, youthful look we are seeking
 
2.  Can you tell me what the back end database was built on and if that is what is wanted for the new site?
	
I do not know about the database.  We just need to ensure that the information and children's information are secure and safe.

3. Is the requested development of the four mascots in order to select one or is to actually use four mascots for different campaigns? 

We would like to go in the following direction... 
    Our goals are to:  
        Get the kids moving
        Increase fitness programs
        Increase youth programs membership
    Four "Fit 4 Fun" areas to focus on are:
       1.  Physical Fitness
       2. Education/Mental Health/Nutrition
       3. Social Benefits
       4.  Safety

We are looking for a team of 4 characters that are the "Fit Force????" (like the Power Ranger??).  Maybe each of the 4 "Fit 4 Fun" program areas are represented by a member of the "Force"

 
4. Can you provide a list of the target markets (ie parents, children, teens, pre-teen, etc..?

Just as the first paragraph of the SOW states: "The web site and fitness program plan should be appropriate to the interest, skills, and abilities of youth 9 to 18 years of age".
