<DESC>This requirement is for the fabrication and build of one (1) Alternative Monochromator Drum Assembly in accordance with NIST drawings which shall be provided to the Contractor.

This drum consists of heavy steel shot (several tons) and paraffin filled components that have to be welded together followed by machining to very tight tolerances.

The specific objective of this requirement is to have one monochromator drum as defined by those drawings and procedures as well as a replacement support column that can, in principle, turn the monochromator into its functional mirror image.

This requirement is being procured via full & open competition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-05-R-0005.

The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about March 15, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.   

No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<SUBJECT>51 -- RFQ-5180-00-177-7033-B
<DESC>This is a Request For Quotation (RFQ) for a quantity of 1,200 of  NSN 5180 00 177 7033 General Mechanics Tool Kit  .  All offers are to be FOB destination.  In addition to the normal clauses that apply to GSA orders, the following clauses apply; 552.225-70 Notice of Procurement Restriction – Hand or Measuring Tools or Stainless Steel Flatware, D-FSS-475 Source Inspection, D-FSS-468 Non-Manufactured Wood Package Material to European Union (Nov 2001).  The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance, Delivery, and Price.  Past Performance will be based on information obtained by GSA’s Administrative Contracting Office in Chicago IL.  Any offeror within the competitive range that has not previously performed work with GSA, (therefore does not have a performance history with GSA), will be given the opportunity to provide references that will verify their ability to perform. Past Performance and Delivery when combined are significantly more important than price.  Where proposals are determined to be essentially equal the award will be made to the contractor submitting the lowest price.  For questions please contact Genia Watson at 816-823-1296, or you may fax questions to 816-823-3109.  Please fax your offers to Genia Watson at 816 823 3109 before noon on February 11, 2005.
