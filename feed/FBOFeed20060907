<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to provide analytical engineering studies to support the UH-1N Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) as part of the overall Aging Aircraft Sustainment effort. This effort addresses those concerns through investigation of life predictions and failure analyses that are a direct concern of long-term aircraft use, consideration of corrosion effects that are seen on aircraft after a substantial time in service, consideration of the effects of new structure that has been added to the aircraft due to modifications and upgrades, and investigation of aircraft usage over its service life and the comparison of that usage to original design intent. This program will compliment the existing generic ASIP program of the UH-1N program office, and will focus on identifying and solving UN-1N specific structural integrity issues listed in the Performance Work Specification associated with the 30+ year age of the aircraft.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command has a requirement for a five year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract issuing firm fixed price (FFP) delivery orders to procure a family of ballistic plates for the Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS) to improve the survivability and mobility of Special Operation Forces (SOF).  The family of ballistic protective armor will maximize ballistic protection while minimizing the burdens of weight, bulk and heat stress.  This will be achieved with the use of three (3) different plate technologies available in different cuts.  The components will integrate with the existing BALCS Releasable Body Armor Vest system providing the ability to increase or decrease ballistic protection and load.  Patterns will be provided to ensure components integrate with the body armor vests systems.  The ballistic protective components will be selected on a performance basis in order to take advantage of most current technologies.  The three systems include, 1) BALCS System:  One cut of ballistic plate that can be used as a back or a front and conform to the pattern provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 6.5 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed .750 inches; 2) Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic System:  Three cuts of ballistic plate conforming to patterns provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 6.9 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed 1.0 inches; and 3) Low Visibility Ballistic System: Three cuts of ballistic plate conforming to patterns provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 4.8 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed .85 inches.  The plates must have been previously ballistically tested (both conditioned and unconditioned); and the proposed BALCS System must have been previously tested in conjunction with a soft armor component with an areal density not to exceed 1.1 lbs.  The test data must demonstrate systems conform to the following ballistic thresholds:  BALCS System and Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic System must defeat 2 shots at 4 inches apart.  None of the shots may be closer than 1 inch from any given edge of the plate being tested.  Both the Tactical Stand Alone and Low Visibility systems will include a small cut and must meet only a 1st shot requirement.

<DESC>The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing  increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.  

An updated draft document of Section B, Contract Line Item Numbers is posted on http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=doing_business.default.  Based on comments received during Industry Day, the draft document is updated and the Government is seeking comments on the attached document. Vendors should submit their written comments and questions no later than 15 September 2006 to Mary Ann Foran, MaryAnn.Foran@navy.mil Angela Tennyson, Angela.Tennyson@navy.mil. 

There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.

<SUBJECT>T--Aerial Photography Archive Acetate Film Duplication
<SOLNBR>NAR060254
<RESPDATE>092106
<ARCHDATE>09072007
<CONTACT>Sara Oletski Contracting Officer 3032366498     Sara_Oletski@blm.gov;
<DESC>BLM Request for Proposal NAR060254, Aerial Photography Archive Acetate Film Duplication.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The anticipated award date is September 25, 2006 for a firm fixed price contract with four (4) one (1) year options. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified within their aerial film archive over 272 cans of B&W, negative aerial roll film on acetate base.  These original rolls are all 9.5 inch format and approximately 180 to 200 feet in length. Deterioration of the aging film base from what is known as "vinegar syndrome" is occurring in varying stages on each of these rolls.  The Bureau has decided to duplicate these acetate roll films onto a more stable, polyester base roll film of 9.5 inch format before placing the original rolls into cold storage for preservation.  Due to funding limitations, only a portion of the 272 rolls will be duplicated in the first year of this contract.  That number will be determined by the awarded price per roll.  The first generation duplicates created via this process will function as the "master" working version of the original acetate films and will be certified as an exact representation of same.  These 40 - 50 year old rolls of acetate film are classified as permanent, records level materials and irreplaceable.  Handling of these originals needs to be minimized and done with extreme caution.  Experience and proven performance with this process will not only be critical, but mandatory for consideration. SCOPE OF WORK: All work will be performed at the contractor's worksite using clean, fully functional and well-maintained equipment capable of producing high quality, first generation duplicate negatives from 9.5 inch B&W aerial roll film directly to 9.5 inch B&W aerial roll film.  The work under this contract shall consist of cleaning, then duplicating each original roll of B&W negative, acetate based, 9.5 inch format, aerial roll film supplied by BLM.   The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will have tested each original roll for acid content with A-D test strips.  The COR will also have visually inspected each roll for damage issues.  This information will be compiled and submitted in report format with each original roll of film with the record of transmittal and receipt.  The contractor will be required to review the film and this report for signature acceptance.  Once signed, a copy will be returned to the COR for concurrence.  This is in addition to the record of transmittal receipt that will be returned for each original roll of film shipped to the contractor's facility.   Should the contractor's review of the acetate roll film not seem consistent with the film condition report provided by the COR, the contractor will notify the COR prior to further handling of the original film.  The COR and the contractor will discuss and resolve any discrepancies to the satisfaction of both parties with the pertinent details noted on the film condition report.  The COR will then provide the contractor with a "revised" film condition report for signature and return receipt to the COR.   Original rolls of acetate film will be transmitted to the contractor in small "batches" (no more than 10 rolls per delivery order).  ALL rolls within a given "batch", along with their associative film condition reports, must be reviewed and accepted by the contractor via return receipt to the COR prior to the commencement of any cleaning and/or duplicating work. The COR will provide written authorization for work to begin on a given batch of roll film once all required documentation as described above is collected and verified for EACH AND EVERY roll within that batch. The contractor must clean all original rolls of acetate film provided by BLM prior to exposure for duplication.  This may be as simple as minimizing static build-up and removing dust particles prior to duplication.  In some instances, high free acidity levels may require "washing" of the acetate film prior to duplication.  Should this be a recommended course of action, the contractor and the COR will discuss the details and document such decisions (with matching signature verification) prior to any procedures. The contractor shall duplicate all original, acetate rolls provided by BLM onto commercial, polyester-based, B&W, aerial, 9.5 inch format, fine-grained duplicating film of same format.  Original rolls will not be combined or spliced together in duplicate form onto larger sized rolls. The contractor shall deliver each duplicate roll in its own canister.  Canisters will be of a durable, non-metal composition.  The duplicate roll film canisters will be labeled in the same manner as the matching, original roll film canister with exactly the same information as provided on the original canister label that will accompany each original roll of film.  The contractor will use blank, formatted labels provided by the COR for this task. Scheduled delivery dates will be based on a given production quantity per order which will vary with shipments of original roll film from BLM. Contractor's proposal shall include timelines for various batch sizes 1 -10. Orders will be completed and returned to the COR within pre-arranged, batch-specific time frames and all film shipments from the contractor to the COR will be via FEDEX overnight ONLY. Contractor's unit price must be FOB destination to National Science & Technology Center, Denver Federal Center, Bldg 50, 6th & Kipling, Denver, CO 80225. FILM QUALITY STANDARDS All film will be processed in accordance with the film manufacturer's instructions.  The negatives on the duplicate rolls shall be uniform in development range of density as measured by densitometric tests. QUALITY CONTROL General - The contractor will maintain an inspection system that will ensure that each task offered to the COR for acceptance or approval conforms to the contract requirements.  The inspection system will be documented and available for review by the COR.  The COR will be permitted access to the contractor's production facilities to inspect quality control records and observe production methods and equipment performance.  Any discrepancy or substandard performance noted by the COR will be cause for further test(s) at the contractor's expense to determine acceptance or rejection of product. Records - The contractor will maintain records of all calibrations, inspections, processing control data and tests throughout the duration of the contract.  The records will indicate the nature and number of observations made, the data obtained, type of deficiencies found and corrective action taken. Contractor's Calibration and Maintenance Systems - The contractor will maintain a calibration and maintenance system to control the accuracy of equipment and of the processing monitoring controls.  The systems will include, as a minimum, a prescribed calibration interval method of calibration and a processing performance monitoring system to assure adherence to contract specifications. Responsibility for Quality Control Inspection - The contractor will be responsible for the performance of all quality control inspection requirements as specified herein.  The contractor will provide space, personnel, equipment, and materials for the performance of all inspection requirements.  Testing, inspections and limited measurements will be performed at the contractor's facility. Quality Control Plan Quality Control Inspections - The quality control and inspections required herein are not intended to reduce any control programs normally employed by the contractor to assure the quality of the product. Quality Control Requirements - The contractor will be responsible for complying with the specifications and requirements of the following factors: Visual General Photographic Quality Professional standards (i.e., no scratches, tears, blemishes, etc.) - These will be assessed and noted by the COR upon receipt of each duplicate roll of film processed by the contractor.  In addition to critical, visual inspection of the duplicate film rolls by the COR for uniform density, tone, contrast and sharpness, two B&W, photographic paper prints will be provided by the contractor from two different frames on each duplicate roll of film produced.  These two frames will be randomly designated by the COR prior to shipment of the original film to the contractor.  They shall be reflective of the overall quality of the original roll film, and will aide in assessing the finished quality of the duplicate rolls. MEASURABLE SPECIFICATIONS Density and Contrast - Measurable Densitometric Specifications - A 21 step sensitometer wedge will be exposed on each duplicate roll of film produced by the contractor.  Densitometer readings from this wedge will be taken and graphed by the contractor and submitted to the COR to verify the quality and consistency of the exposure and processing of the duplicate rolls produced.  A gamma of .95 will be the target; but, with the given inconsistencies in the density and contrast of the original rolls of acetate film, some variances may be acceptable upon discussion and agreement with the COR.  Any such variances will be documented within the requirements of the Quality Control Plan and co-signed by the COR and the contractor. Silver Residual Test - A residual silver test will be performed to verify thorough fixation of photographic black and white material.  A test solution, Kodak Residual Silver Test Solution ST-1, or equivalent, will be used (reference Kodak Data for Aerial Photography Manual M-29).  The test will be performed on the emulsion side in a clear area of the processed material.  Tests that indicate insufficient fixation will be cause for rejection of that duplicate roll. Archival Assurance Test - To verify that the wash of the photographic material is sufficient to meet archival quality, a test will be performed on the emulsion side in a clear area of processed photographic black and white material using Kodak Test Solution HT-2 and a Kodak Hypo Estimator or their equivalent (reference Kodak Data for Aerial Photography Manual, M-29).  Tests that indicate insufficient wash will be cause for rejection of that duplicate roll. FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS AND TESTS Each duplicate roll of film produced by the contractor and delivered as final product to the COR will be tested by the contractor in accordance with the specifics of the Quality Control Plan as delineated above; and, each duplicate roll of film delivered to the COR will be accompanied by ALL test results as required under Measurable Specifications above. Quality Assurance Performed by COR - Preliminary quality assurance (prior to each item acceptance) will be performed by the COR (or designated representative) at the BLM's Aerial Archive facility in Denver, CO.  Recorded inspection data, tests and corrective action performed by the contractor during production of the duplicate roll films will be reviewed as part of this inspection.  Additional test(s) shall be made at the discretion of the COR.  Final acceptance of each duplicate roll will be made by the COR. Rejected Tasks - Duplicate rolls that fail to meet specifications and standards as stated in this contract will be rejected and those rolls will be replaced/corrected at the contractor's cost. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED AERIAL FILM Data Rights - This film is and will remain the property of the United States Government. The BLM retains the rights to all master negative roll films supplied to the contractor for duplicating purposes, all duplicate roll films produced by the contractor, and all information generated for reports or invoices related to the performance of this contract.  No film or information related to this contract will be used by the contractor, in whole or in part, for purposes other than the performance of the tasks specified within this contract. BLM original (archival), aerial film rolls will be shipped to the contractor via FEDEX overnight for use in performing tasks authorized within this contract.  The contractor assumes full responsibility for said film while it is within the confines of the contractor's site. All Government film furnished under this contract will not be removed from the contractor's facility except as authorized by the COR.  The contractor and COR will each maintain a record of transmittal and receipt of each roll of aerial film, listing project name, roll identification number, date of transaction, transaction (i.e., shipped film to or receive film from) and significant comments within one working day from when the transaction occurred.  A signed receipt for each roll received will be returned to sender to verify completion of delivery. This is a 100% set-aside for small business.  The standard NAICS classification is 541922.  Size standard is $6.5 million.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding special methylation studies on Environmental and Genetic Lung cancer Etiology, (EAGLE) biospecimens from lung cancer cases (blood and tissue) and controls (blood only) with The Universita Degli Studi Di Milano, Milan, Italy.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 with the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

EAGLE (Environmental and Genetic Lung cancer Etiology) is a large population-based case-control study including over 2,000 incident lung cancer cases and over 2,000 age-, sex-, and residence-matched healthy controls.  The study setting involves five cities and 216 surrounding municipalities in the Lombardy region of Italy, encompassing over 1.3 million people in the selected age range of 35-79 years.  Few studies have the wealth of data and information of the EAGLE study in order to investigate the exposure, genetic and clinical correlates of methylated gene findings.   The relationship of these changes in tissue and blood to exposure profile, histology, outcome and clinical characteristics and other molecular studies is a key focus of our effort.

The laboratory at the University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Osdedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan Italy has conducted aberrant DNA methylation and epigenetic gene expression studies on peripheral blood using bisulfite-PCR pyrosequencing and allele specific pyrosequencing for specific genes. The laboratory has conducted these studies on over 200 subjects similar to the target population to be of EAGLE, i.e. healthy individuals including tobacco smokers, selected from the same region (based on environmental exposures, age, gender, etc.)  

The laboratory is uniquely qualified to perform studies involving characterization of cancer genes from both blood and tissue. Studies cannot be conducted in different laboratories since this would make a tissue/blood comparison impossible and the variation introduced by the different laboratories would be hard to quantitate. The EAGLE samples are precious and irreplaceable. The molecular tissue assays required for this study derive from the Lombardy region of Italy in the region where the proposed study laboratory is located. The laboratory investigators understand the unique nature of this resource since they spent much of the last 5 years organizing the collection of this unique specimen collection.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.     These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare Contracting environment. CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, that will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program. As such, CMS anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 4 (comprised of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas), Jurisdiction 5 (comprised of the states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska), and Jurisdiction 12 (comprised of the states of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).       

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers. It is anticipated that this competition will result in award of three, stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four, one-year options.     Any questions should be directed to Darrell Bachman, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-7442, or by sending e-mail to Darrell.Bachman@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers. Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.     CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 30, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory in Las Vegas, NV intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price purchase order to Canberra Industries, Inc. of Meriden, CT using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain two (2) Gamma Analyst-Integrated Gamma Spectrometers to include fully integrated sample changer-based, 40 % High Purity Germanium (HPGe)  detector gamma spectrometers, lead shield assemblies, signal processing electronics, instrument integration, related software for clients and servers, and installation for EPA's Center for Radioanalysis and Quality Assurance (CRQA), co-located on the University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) campus.   CRQA is responsible for support of the laboratory's overall technical mission with laboratory-focused radiation analysis, technical support, and quality assurance assistance.  CRQA provides expertise in radiological emergency preparedness and response and provides quality technical support in the  areas of sample preparation, hotline, decontamination, and analysis.  CRQA is also responsible for the development of analytical methods in support of radiochemistry and radioanalysis and designs and implements studies pertaining to the radiological quality of the environment including evaluation,  quality assurance project plan assistance, and data validation and interpolation.  CRQA currently uses older equipment to perform radiological gamma and alpha spectroscopy - a gamma analyst and two older pieces of equipment; this equipment is operated using a VMS (Vax) system.  The VMS software  suite is obsolete and is no longer available commercially. The hardware system employs a communication system that requires an older model 386 computer system for operation and functionality. The application software for the current software platform, provided by Canberra Industries, Inc., is no  longer being enhanced or developed.    Based upon these developments, CRQA seeks to upgrade the current system take advantage of the latest developments on Windows-based platforms.   This includes client and server operation, new Web-based instruments, redundancy, and other enhanced electronics.   Under this order, the Contractor shall also upgrade the software and hardware to conform to contemporary PC-based standards.  The current system employs Canberra hardware and software, which is proprietary.  To replace the entire system with non-proprietary software will result in increased costs  to the Government and a complete shutdown of the operational units for the gamma and alpha spectroscopy analyses.  Upgrading the current system is more cost effective and ensures a turnkey non-disruptive implementation.  In addition, the upgrading of the system hardware and software to a modern  PC-based client server mode is complementary to professional contemporary standards.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334516. Based on the foregoing, it has been determined that Canberra is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's  requirement. As such, NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a written capabilities statement, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers in writing via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>Project Description:

This acquisition is necessary to meet SSA continued needs to provide all SSA health and safety representatives nationwide with annual training related to their work environment.  Training is intended for office occupational safety and health representatives located at SSA facilities nationwide in order to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1960 and SSA/AFGE Agreement, Article 9.  SSA has been fulfilling this requirement in a web-based format.  The existing training courseware was previously developed and copyrighted by Pure Works, Inc.  The courseware is hosted on Pure Works??? server and is accessed via the Internet.   Most safety training vendors offer course content primarily related to high hazard industrial environments.  The majority of SSA employees work in an office environment, therefore training related to high hazard industrial environments in inappropriate.  Pure Works is the only vendor that offers the variety of office-focused courses required.  

In addition, Pure Works has developed these SSA-specific courses that are now part of the course library and must continue to be available to SSA health and safety representatives.  These courses serve as both a reference for existing representatives and a training tool for new representatives. 

Negative Impact:

The cost of implementing a new product would not be cost effective and would be counter productive.  Elimination of Pure Works as the vendor would remove the necessary courses from the course library and necessitate significant redevelopment workloads and costs of creating a new library with a new vendor.  A new vendor could not re-create the same courses now available in our library.  Current courses contain Pure Works off-the-shelf copyrighted material and are maintained on the Pure Works server.  The use of two separate vendors (Pure Works for existing courses and a new vendor for new courses) would not be cost effective or practical.  Development time and costs to create new courses under a new vendor would delay the training of SSA employees for 6-9 months or possibly longer.  Basic set-up, review, testing and implementation to accomplish the use of the new courses would result in extensive time delays and impractical costs.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bamboo Solutions Corporation, 11417 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, Virginia 20190, to supply professional services for continued data preparation for import into the SSA Drawing Information Management System.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements?.  Bamboo Solutions Corporation is the developer and programmer of the Digital Information Management System.  Bamboo Solutions Corporation is the sole provider of support for WD3 and CAD Trak.  The products are the only ones of their kind available to SSA for electronically managing SSA building data in the Microsoft Windows Environment with enhanced data security SSA Shared Hosting Environment (SHE).  Interested parties that feel they can provide these services may respond by submitting their capability statements by email to Kim.Clark@ssa.gov by September 13, 2006.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date (September 13, 2006), the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with Bamboo Solutions Corporation.  Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned. 

The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for this acquisition will be posted separately on 09/07/2006 - Reference Number is 062657-1

<DESC>Detailed Project Description:

This acquisition is necessary to meet SSA continued needs for application development of data preparation for import into the SSA Drawing Information Management System (DIMS).  The existing Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) application and WD3 and CAD Trak EMDS applications are proprietary to Bamboo Solutions Corporation.  This application has been tested extensively by SSA and the application is ready to go into production for central office facilities personnel.  The next phase of development will focus on regional data import and deployment.  The WD3 application will be used to control and manage access / revision of SSA building plans.  

Additional applications development shall focus on restoring viewer functionally to mark-up and annotate drawings electronically and develop a project tracking application to replace the current stand alone application currently used by SSA regional teams and SSA contractors.  The new application development must support electronic data import for SSA regional building data and be consistent with all remaining SSA building import utility development for SSA Headquarters campus in Woodlawn.

DIMS will support enhanced security and revision control of SSA building information guaranteeing that SSA building information is accurate and available to authorized SSA personnel instantaneously from a desktop PC. Additionally the DIMS application will provide essential SSA infrastructure identification as required under presidential mandate Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) to SSA COOP staff members and local emergency response services during emergency situations. 

Negative Impact:

The cost of implementing a new product purchase would not be cost-effective and counter productive.  With major appropriation cuts in FY07 the likelihood of funding this type of project would be remote at any point in the foreseeable future. The time factor to process another Special Expense Item (SEI) funding request would delay this project by another 2-5 years or possibly longer. The investments in SSA hardware and software recourses would be extensive the initial award and supplemental IT funding of more than $700K would be lost on this project.

This would result in a loss of more than 170 work years for DCS and DCBFM resources allotted for this project. The implementation also required extensive changes in the Shared Hosting Environment (SHE). Those basic setup costs would have to meet again with new contractor.  Staff costs would be repeated to accomplish the roll-out of the new product. This includes a substantial loss of training funds expended by OFM since the project award of more than $125K to train facilities personnel on WD3 and AutoCAD applications.  To bring another contractor and application onboard at this time would cause extensive delays (6-9 months) for a new contractor to develop the appropriate electronic process models for OFM business to business and business to client workflows. A new contractor would also have a considerable learning curve for SSA testing processes and procedures.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) awarded a $44M, 42 month, Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract to SPARTA on July 3, 2003 to provide discrimination algorithm and decision architecture prototype development for Project Hercules.   The current period of performance expires on November 30, 2006.  MDA intends to extend the period of performance (POP) and increase the ceiling value of this  SPARTA Decision Architecture (DA) contract HQ0006-03-C-0049 by two years and an estimated twenty million dollars respectively. Under this contract, Sparta develops advanced discrimination and tracking algorithms and applies advanced decision theory to future Command Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC) concepts. Sparta will continue to provide these capabilities identified by C2BMC in blocks 2006, 2008, and 2010.  These changes are necessary to avoid C2BMC schedule delays on Decision Architecture (DA) components that Project Hercules, under the Advanced Technology (DV) Deputate, delivered to C2BMC or capability Project Hercules will provide identified by C2BMC in blocks 2006, 2008 and 2010.  Sparta has a key understanding of delivered and in-development prototype software that supports near-term C2BMC capability.  Sparta has developed and delivered the multi-sensor discrimination capability, the Integrated Engagement Planner (IEP), and also missile-type classification, all of which support C2BMC Block 08 capability.  Furthermore, the Decision Architecture has developed several additional components that are in the final stages of Project Hercules development with an intended transition to C2BMC in the 2007/2008 timeframe.  Due to the maturity of the algorithms and the Project Hercules commitment to integration of not only delivered but pending capabilities, Sparta is the only contractor whose personnel have the expertise to support the integration of and improve the delivered software within the required timeframes.  At least a two-year delay would result with a change to a different contractor.  
The proposed contract action is for algorithm development and integration support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement in writing by no later than September 22, 2006 to Shirlee R. Madeloff via e-mail at Shirlee.Madeloff@mda.mil. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Southern California, Norris Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033 for data from the International Twin Study and the California Twin Program. Twin studies are regarded as a gold standard for providing valid estimates of heritability, by comparing expected numbers of disease in monozygotic versus dyzogotic twins. The data on twins would allow several different analyses that would advance the understanding of genetics and the pathogenesis of NHL, Hodgkin?s, multiple myeloma, and leukemia.  There are presently two registries with over 2000 twins with hematologic malignancies enrolled: the International Twin Study and the California Twin Program.  The combination of these two twin registries would provide the largest numbers of twins for analysis and a length of follow-up (average is over 14 years) this would provide sufficient outcomes.  Only through this unique resource and opportunity would we obtain valid estimates of heritability.  The University of Southern California shall provide:  1)  Development of follow-up questionnaire and forms for data retrieval;  2)  For twins from the International Twin Study:  a) follow-up via telephone calls of ~500 twins still expected to be alive; b) follow-up through retrieval of death records for those deceased, consisting of death certificate retrieval with cause of death; c) link all twins to cancer registry data; d) clean follow-up data; and e) send data in spreadsheet or SAS form to NCI; and 3)  For twins from the California Twin Program: a)retrieve death certificates with cause of death for all deceased twins; b) link twins to the California Cancer Registry; c)clean data; and d) send data in spreadsheet or SAS form to NCI.  The University of Southern California is the only organization known to the NCI Researcher that has access to the data about participants in both the International Twin Registry and the California Twin Program is maintained.  This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on September 21, 2006. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions intends to issue a purchase order on a non competitive basis  to Battistello Consulting, Inc., 8120 Morning Breeze Drive, Elkridge,  Maryland 21075, to provide project management consulting services for the NHLBI, Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  The NHLBI, DIR requires the services of an expert consultant (Facilities Manager) to provide a variety of space and facilities planning, acquisition and general management services.  The consultant?s responsibilities include the monitoring of the planned renovations for newly constructed or renovated facilities.  The NHLBI, DIR also requires the assistance in the management of currently occupied space at both on and off-campus facilities.   STATEMENT OF WORK. GENERAL:  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans, coordinates, and directs a wide range of activities of basic and clinical scientific research programs within the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) in such areas as heart and vascular disease; normal and abnormal cardiovascular and hematologic physiology; genetic studies; cellular and molecular biology; cell signaling; biophysics and biochemistry; and other applied and clinically-related research interest.   Over the past 5 years, the NHLBI/DIR has had an immediate need to renovate or expand its existing space.   This need have become more pressing, thus requiring the assistance of a highly skilled Facilities Manager.  The Facilities Manager will provide expert consultant services in the areas of space and facilities planning, acquisition and general management.   The NHLBI/DIR has numerous on-going renovation and construction projects and foresees the number to increase significantly over the next three to five years.   Though the NHLBI/DIR has the responsibility to manage space and facility programs, the related services involving these programs are not inherently governmental.    Contractual support has been determined to be the most cost-efficient method to accomplish the required facilities? management.  BACKGROUND:  In 2001, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) required the immediate services of an expert consultant to provide a variety of space and facilities planning, acquisition and general management services.  The primary focus of the consultant was on monitoring of the planned renovations to newly constructed or renovated facilities.  The NHLBI also required assistance in the management of currently occupied space at both on and off-campus facilities.  WORK SPECIFICATIONS:  The expert consultant is expected to provide timely recommendations to the Division of Intramural Research Scientific Director (SD) and the Chief of the Intramural Administrative Management Branch (IAMB) on any space related issues/concerns.  The Scientific Director and the Chief, IAMB will evaluate these recommendations and will decide whether to accept or reject any recommendations made by the expert consultant.

All work performed under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, the Scientific Director, DIR, and the Chief, Intramural Administrative Management Branch.  

Battestillo Consulting, Inc., is uniquely qualified for this requirement given that they have been performing under a 5-year contract which was competitively awarded to Battistello Consulting, Inc.,  in September 2001 to meet these needs. The original contract was established to support the NHLBI and the National Cancer Institute.  Due to the increase number of renovations and other facilities planning, the last three years of the current contract was solely dedicated to NHLBI. Since the inception of this contract, the NHLBI facilities planning has included relocating newly constructed or renovated space in Buildings 9, 10, 12, 14 and 50.  The NHLBI also participated in a major renovation/expansion of 5 Research Court and several other off-campus facilities.   Battistello Consulting, Inc is currently managing more than 16 spaces and facilities projects for the DIR/NHLBI.  These projects total 51,465 square feet with a total budget more than $9.5 million.  Battistello Consulting?s expertise and years of experience are invaluable to the success of these current projects.  Battistello Consulting has played an instrumental part in the planning, designing and the managing of each of these projects.  Battistello Consulting, Inc works closely with the scientists, Project Officers, Project Managers, other institute Facilities Managers and the NIH Space and Facilities Office regarding these projects. These relationships coupled with Battistello Consulting?s years of knowledge and direct experience with NIH is critical to the success of these projects.    As we approach the end of the current contract, the NHLBI/DIR recognized the continual need of this requirement.  The NHLBI/DIR has numerous on-going or future projects that include, but are not limited to, 6-8 major renovations in Building 10, 3 projects in Building 50, 2 moves/renovations in 14E/F, Poolesville move and several projects in rental space at off-campus facilities.  These renovations as well as future projects are a high priority for the NHLBI/DIR thus, the continual service of a Facilities Manager is a necessity.  

The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise possessed by Battestillo Consulting, Inc. Battestillo Consulting would be able to continue the work already in process under the expiring contract for the period September 30, 2006 through October 31, 2006, while the negotiation of a sole source contract is underway.  An award to any other source would affect the Institute?s anticipated outcome based upon Battestillo Consulting, Inc.?s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. This is a small business set-aside requirement.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Downtown, Washington, DC, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 272,408 square feet of contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The space must yield a minimum of 250,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for a 5year firm term with two (2) 5 year renewal options.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 24, 2008.  The delineated area is within the Central Employment Area (CEA) of Washington, DC, the Southwest Waterfront of Washington, DC and the area north of Massachusetts Avenue, known as NOMA.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

The space should be located in a Class A office building that is new or modern and projects a professional and aesthetically pleasing appearance.  The space should be located on the second floor or higher and should have included 11 inside parking spaces which must be reserved for the Government agency, and include signage to clearly designate them as such.

The entire space must have a minimum column spacing of 20 foot on centers.  The space must also be capable of housing one room of the size 2,150 square feet and the other room of the size 825 square feet, both of which shall be free of building columns throughout, contain a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet, and the capability of being configured for effective and efficient layouts.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Thursday, November 30, 2006

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals from qualified professionals to facilitate its existing Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment course.  In addition, NTI may request proposers to edit/update the existing course materials.

The goal of the course is to present the Federal Transit Administration?s procedures and methods for predicting and assessing noise and vibration impacts from proposed mass transit projects.  The training modules in this three-day course closely follow the procedures contained in FTA?s recently updated guidance on the subject (Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment, May 2006).  The course gives an overview of the environmental review process and how noise and vibration assessment fits into FTA?s planning and project development processes.  Fundamentals of noise and vibration are discussed along with the specific metrics and impact criteria that are used in noise and vibration assessments.  Different levels of analysis for noise and vibration are presented, along with considerations in choosing the appropriate level of analysis depending on the type of project and the stage of project development.  The emphasis is on predicting impacts from operation of new transit systems; however, construction impacts are also covered.  The course covers all the typical transit modes as well as multi-modal highway/transit projects.  Various measures to mitigate excessive levels of transit noise and vibration are also discussed.  A number of class exercises and case studies are brought in to reinforce the concepts, procedures, and practices introduced in the course.  Ample time is allocated toward the end of the session to discuss attendees? questions and issues related to specific projects.

To obtain a copy of the complete Request for Proposal, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement & Contracting address above. Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted; telephone requests are unacceptable. Requests will be honored if received by 
Tuesday, October 17, 2006.                    .

Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small business, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses. These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Paula Kestler, 410-278-0795
<DESC>The US Army Research Development Evaluation Command (RDECOM) Acquisition Center, Aberdeen, MD intends to negotiate on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C., Section 2304 (c) (2) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2).  The RDECOM Acquisition Center intends to negotiate and award a contract to Thermo Electron Corporation, 81 Wyman Street, Waltham, MA 024 54-9046  2.1. Specimen Processing  Specimen processing consists of accepting the shipment of specimens from frozen transport, verifying the contents of the shipment, accessing the specimens into the inventory by performing data entry on the individual card board containers or by performing data entry on the individual specimens, performing quality control checks, and placing the cardboard containers of specimens in precise locations in the large walk-in freezers for storage.  Currently, shipments from the co ntract laboratory and the Air Force testing laboratory occur on a quarterly basis. It is anticipated that during the contract period, shipments from these laboratories shall occur on a more frequent basis, requiring weekly or bi-weekly specimen processing.   Currently, each shipment from the contract laboratory (currently Viromed Labs, in Eden Prairie, Minnesota) and the Air Force testing laboratory (currently at Brooks City Base, Texas) contains approximately 350,000 specimens. Shipments are currently recei ved in pallets containing cardboard containers with the specimens inside. It is anticipated that during the contract period, shipments from these laboratories may be received in non-palletized form, or be shipped to the DoDSR from one or more laboratories via commercial courier. Shipments from other laboratories may be received in non-palletized form or shipped via commercial courier. The cardboard containers containing specimens from the contract laboratory and the Air Force testing laboratory are approxim ately 6 x 18 x 3.5 in size and contains 308 specimens, each consisting of approximately 2.5mL of frozen serum. Specimens from other laboratories may be received in loose form, or in non-standard cardboard containers, requiring manual resorting and place ment into standard containers. All specimen processing steps will be performed in a timely manner. Care will be taken during specimen processing to minimize specimen temperature fluctuations. The contractor shall store the specimens at 25°C immediately af ter the specimens are accessed into inventory system.  2.2. Laboratory Operations  The contractor shall perform laboratory operations to prepare specimens for shipping to other facilities for studies when requested by the Contracting Officer or his represe ntative (COR or COTR).  Laboratory operations shall include thawing retrieved frozen specimens, preparing and labeling aliquots of serum from the retrieved specimens, preparing a determined number of aliquots for shipment, preparing and labeling aliquots o f remaining serum for further frozen storage, and reshelving of the aliquots. To support laboratory operations, timely manual retrieval and reshelving of specimens and aliquots shall be required.Currently, the single automated liquid handling platform at t he DoDSR can produce aliquots from specimens at a rate of approximately 60 per hour. With production of aliquots as the rate-limiting step, approximately 500 specimens can be aliquoted per work day in preparation for studies. It is expected that during the  contract period, the contractor shall support an increased specimen throughput of 1,000 specimens per day.  To support proper laboratory operations, the contractor shall maintain the laboratory to standards defined by Good Laboratory Procedures. The contr actor shall have a Medical Laboratory Technician Certification (MLT) or a Medical Technologist Certification (MT).  2.3. Data Entry  The contractor shall perfor m data entry in support of specimen processing, laboratory operations, and to support the conversion of a backlog of historical paper manifest records into electronic format. During specimen processing the contractor shall perform data entry to access the specimens into the inventory system. Data entry steps may include manually entering container number, manually entering individual specimen number and location data, and performing quality control checks. Currently, for specimens received from the contract  laboratory, inventory information, including container number, the specimen numbers and the location of each specimen number within each box, is provided by the contract laboratory. This information is automatically entered into the inventory system in pr eparation for specimen accession. Currently, for specimens received from the Air Force lab and for specimens received from other laboratories, specimen number and location information is not automatically entered into the inventory system, requiring manual  data entry during processing. During processing, quality control checks will be performed to verify the accuracy of data entry. During laboratory operations, the contractor shall perform data entry to record retrieved and reshelved specimens, to track ste ps in the specimen aliquotting process, to track aliquots prepared for shipment, and to track aliquots reshelved in the inventory. The contractor will enter data from a backlog of historical paper manifest records into the computer system as time permits d uring the operations of the DoDSR. During the data entry, quality control checks will be performed to verify the accuracy of data entry.  2.4. General Repository Operations  The contractor shall provide management of the DoDSR personnel and repository oper ations. The contractor shall provide a Point of Contact for the monitoring system, who shall be available to answer an alarm 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Upon notification from the monitoring system, the designated contractor staff shall immediately repo rt to the repository to correct the problem or alert maintenance personnel. The contractor will provide a Point of Contact for the government with regard to operations of the contract. The repository personnel shall assist the Project Officer with procurin g repository supplies through government channels.

Currently , specimens from these laboratories are loaded onto pallets and are packaged in shrink-wrap by the contract lab prior to transport. Currently, shipments are prepared for transportation approximately once every two months. It is expected that during the con tract period, the frequency of specimen transportation shall increase to once every two weeks. It is anticipated that should shipment frequency increase, the volume of specimens transported per shipment shall decrease proportionally. The contractor shall p rovide local transportation of specimens and shipments of aliquots to locations within a 70 mile radius of the repository. The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, and supplies necessary to transport and deliver the specimens or shipments of aliq uots. During all transportation operations, the contractor shall ensure that the storage container and material within a box is maintained at a temperature 25°C or below. The contractor shall provide fo r redundant cold storage capability to maintain specimen temperature in the event of primary freezer failure occurring during transport operations. The contractor shall obtain all necessary Department of Transportation and other government exemptions and p ermits for the transportation of biological materials, including bio-hazardous materials, and for the operation and maintenance of the truck. If leased vehicles are utilized during transport operations, the contractor shall obtain proper insurance document ation, including vehicle insurance and material insurance, prior to use of the vehicle for transport.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                   September 06
Presolicitation Conference          September 06
RFP Release                         October 06
Contract Award                      May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Navy has a small purchase requirement for Information Technology technical services.  The NAVFAC Engineering Command developed the Public Works Center Management Information System (PWCMIS) to keep track of the financial and production information used by the FECs.  DWAS replaced PWCMIS, but does not extend or distribute labor data, which is done by the Labor Management Support Information System (LMSIS). The Micro Computer Data Entry Program (MDEP) provides for different methods for update in LSMIS or DWAS.  LMSIS, MDEP and the Legacy Application Migration Database (LAMDB) require technical and interface support in accordance with the government Statement of Work.  The Navy requires approximately four (4) man-years of support effort with a man-year equivalent to 2,080 hours to include vacation and leave.  The period of performance is for one year.  Most of the funding will be provided early in fiscal year 2007.  This acquisition is set aside for small business.  Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is compliant with the solicitation, and is determined to be best value to the government considering technical, price, and other factors considered.  Award will be made under simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The point of contact is Naomi Melendez, 202-685-8051.  The solicitation will be made available the week of 5 September 2006 with closing 08 September 2006, 0900 PM.  The proposal may be obtained at: http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or upon request.  Proposals shall be submitted either by fax at 202-685-1788 with receipt confirmed, or electronically to:  naomi.melendez@navy.mil

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) Patuxent River is seeking information from potential sources regarding high effective radiated power threat simulator development at U.S Navy training ranges.  The intended use of this technology is to accurately simulate  modern, multiple target tracking electronically scanned array air defense radars in support of aircrew training. This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  The intent is to support an analysis of alternatives (AOA) that would encompass requirement definition and the use of a systems engineering process to evaluate candidate systems.  The AoA will examine the metrics including: effective radiated power, frequency range, pulse repetition interval (PRI) and PRI patterns, intrapulse modulations, simulation of multi-target tracking capability, beamwidth, gain, beam scan parameters, sidelobes, portability, programmability, etc., that meet the high - fidelity requirements for the U.S. Navy threat radar simulators.  Wide radio frequency (RF) range is of great interest to cover the maximum possible number of radar types with one simulator with an objective of matching the actual radar effective radiated power levels.  Incremental increases in capability are desirable if its spreads the procurement costs across several years but yields useful initial capability.  Actual aircraft tracking capabilities may not be necessary if the simulator can accurately replicate the transmissions and multiple target tracking capability of modern air defense radars, and can point beams accurately at tactical aircraft using Tactical Combat Training System track data.  Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to Richard Egan, Code 4.5.5, 48110 Shaw Road, Suite 3122, NAS Patuxent River, MD 20670-1906.  Interested companies are requested to provide the following information: Company point of contact, address and phone number; EW system description to include weight, size, power, and performance capabilities; data format (s); available timeframe and a description of current or past efforts in EW threat simulators against airborne targets and/or ultra wideband RF technology especially at high - fidelity effective radiated power levels.  Respondents must clarify if their organization can provide commercial or non-developmental/prototype items that could be modified to meet NAVAIRSYSCOM requirements.  Written responses are to be limited to five pages plus pre-printed brochures.  Submit responses/brochures any time on or before XX September 2006.  All proprietary portions of the submitted responses should be clearly identified and will be treated with the strictest of confidence.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  Please reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents.  Written responses are not restricted in any way to any particular entity.

Please address all technical questions to Mr. Richard Egan, Code 4.5.5, (301) 342-0051.  This announcement is NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately in FedBiZOpps.

<DESC>This is a request for information only (sources sought) and not a solicitation.  
The U.S. Coast Guard, CEU Providence requests feedback from interested, capable contractors related to an indefinite delivery requirements contract for 32 buildings at a Coast Guard housing complex in Staten Island, NY. The contract is planned to begin in FY2007 and may take from 5 to 10 years to complete given that the buildings need to be vacant and only two to four buildings will be worked on per year.  The contract may consist of two parts: 
 (1) A performance based fixed-price component for installation of a fully code compliant automatic wet pipe fire suppression system and a remote reporting fire alarm system in each building. Water supply is adequate for the entire site and within each building. It is expected that all work will be limited to the buildings? interior. Contractor shall provide sprinkler heads in all rooms, corridors and accessible common areas in accordance with the most current codes. The garage/carport sprinklers will be in an unheated space and must be installed in a manner to prevent damage during cold weather. The existing fire alarm system requires replacement as it is not remote reporting, thus is inadequate for the new wet pipe sprinkler system.
 (2) A construction fixed-price component for miscellaneous building compliance repairs. Deficiencies requiring correction include: entry and egress doors with no visible UL label, inadequate combustion air to the furnaces, inadequate exhaust ventilation from the bathrooms, excessive runs for dryer exhausts, problems with the crawl space ventilation, duct work and insulation, and electrical repairs to correctly size and replace main circuit breakers. Additional items may be required and will be identified during an upcoming design effort. Contract will also call for aesthetically pleasing refinishing or repair work for all disturbed areas to meet or exceed existing conditions.

The 32 buildings are mostly 3-story structures. Twenty eight buildings are 13,564 SF each, while the remaining 5 buildings are between 4452 SF to 13,000 SF. The buildings hold from 6 to 12 apartments, each containing 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are approx. 9 building layouts that will be provided to potential offerors.  Request industry responses include notices of interest, suggestions for solicitation format, pricing schedules, escalation factors to be used in cost analysis for work to be performed in future years, and any other suggestions industry may want to convey prior to issuance of the solicitation in FY2007. Please include your size status, i.e., Hub-Zone, small business, small disadvantaged business, large business.

Interested parties should provide responses to this notice to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Jean Bretz at the USCG, CEU Providence, 300 Metro Center Blvd., Warwick, RI 02886, or via email to Jean.M.Bretz@uscg.mil

The purpose of this purchase order is to modify the current E-Language Learning System (ELLS) application to remove the proprietary software within the system and replace that functionality with an open source software for the purpose of removing any proprietary licensing restrictions associated with the ELLS system and source code.  ED intends to share the ELLS application development with all parties interested in learning from developments that occurred during the research and development of the application.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the Contracting Officer has determined that only one source, Little Planet Learning, is reasonably available to meet this requirement.

Little Planet Learning has contributed some of the most significant advances in the elanguage learning community since the launch of the ELLS initiative. Flash, a product of the Adobe/Macromedia Corporation, is the dominant Internet-content authoring program.  Little Planet has expanded the functionality of Flash to the benefit of all web-content developers as a result of the ELLS initiative. These innovations include development of the first Flash-based Chinese character word processing application, and the ability to develop Flash content that is both SCORM and Section 508 compliant.

Little Planet has dedicated years of research and development to this and other initiatives to produce a robust and reusable software application engine to support the ELLS program for Chinese and other languages. The reusable instructional design methodology utilizing scenarios, contextual exercises, and cutting-edge voice recognition algorithms were combined, tested and perfected for a variety of ELLS applications. Every detail of the visual design and interactive elements were developed and tested to meet or exceed the expectations of increasingly sophisticated media consumers- our audience.

The outcome of Little Planet's research and development has been the establishment of the reusable software-based ELLS design and production environment, along with scripts for the remaining 30 episodes to complete the Chinese language project.  Little Planet's push to achieve production efficiency has yielded tremendous economy for the Department of Education- they are able to rapidly complete production with no additional programming expenses. Little Planet is the only vendor capable of completing this initiative for the simple cost of multimedia production. Any other vendor would require the anticipated contract term and budget to learn the established methodology and structure of the program's rich underlying features.

The Department intends to execute this purchase order on or before September 30, 2006.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy has a requirement for the continuance of the leased book plan for the Community Center Library for the period October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007.

This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid and is not to be construed as a commitment to award one or more resulting contracts.   The service is currently provided by the McNaughton Book Service (Brodart Company).   The plan consists of the BF-10 for adult lease books and the childrens book plan (90 points).

 The purpose of this request for information is to determine whether this requirement should be competed.  Changing library requirements could potentially cause a significant disruption in service and a break in continuity.  The costs of removing hundreds of bibliographic records from the library automated system would have to be born by the successful awardee and would have to be recognized in any offer.
            

Following is a suggested outline  for a response to this RFI.   This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.   Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

Section 1 Description of your alternative lease book plan and childrens book plan
Section 2 Suggestions for the disposition of the 900 titles currently owned by the incumbent contractor.
Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates.  Annual cost of your plan and your estimate of the time requirement for the Government to convert the Community Center Library to your plan.   And the tasks required to convert to your suggested plan while minimizing a disruption in service.

Section 4 Corporate Expertise
Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and business size.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.   All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.   Responses to the RFI will not be returned.   In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI), a market survey to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications to be used in planning a future performance-based requirement. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to gain knowledge regarding the capabilities and qualifications of companies interested in participating in satisfying this requirement.  Response to this RFI will not be returned.  Information received in response to this RFI may be used to assess alternatives available in determining how to proceed in the acquisition.  Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements but specific information identified as proprietary will be safeguarded as such.

The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office is seeking qualified, experienced sources to provide support for the research, development, and refinement of policies, strategies, and concepts through independent research, innovative analytical, evaluative, and researched monographs, briefings, and seminars to the Office of Force Transformation (OFT).

The Director, Force Transformation is a principle staff assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and acts as the advocate, focal point, and catalyst for transformation within the Department of Defense.  Transformation is not a process with a final destination, therefore as the Department transforms, the debate is not about the ultimate goal of transformation, but rather on its substance and the rate at which DoD transforms.  Significant progress has been made within DoD since transformation was elevated to the level of strategy, but much more is required.   Even as the Department proceeds in building the capabilities required to increase its competitive edge, transformation itself is transforming.  DoD's role in national security continues to evolve as the future nature of war is further defined, and the new security environment is better understood.   The reality of the strategic environment is resulting in changes to our national security strategy.  These changes require new military capabilities and new approaches, and thus the transforming of transformation.  The process itself must be adaptive, ready to respond with new capabilities to a world where accelerating change and increasing ambiguity are dominant features.   

The National Defense Strategy for the United States delineates four security challenges the Department currently faces: traditional threats, irregular threats, catastrophic threats, and disruptive threats.  Events such as the war in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and globalization are compelling not only the intensity of transformation, but also its character.  The OFT recognizes these challenges, and through its role as proponent for transformation the office will continue to promote and catalyze the individual ideas, the technologies, and the organizational innovations that will best support DoD's evolving role in this nation's defense.

The selected contractor shall support OFT in research and analysis of focused scenarios related to anticipated or potential missions for elements of the military.  Typically these scenarios will be of a broad spectrum of complexity and duration and of a variety of traditional and non-traditional deployments of U. S. forces at home or abroad; e.g., terrorism and counterterrorism; military measures or countermeasures; stabilization efforts; post-conflict reconstruction; disaster relief; rehabilitation of local infrastructure, including irrigation and sanitation; etc.    Products developed under this contract may be used to determine appropriate areas for study in the broader OFT effort in the development, refinement and effective management of its program of analysis, study, planning, implementation, review, and assessment of department-wide transformation strategies. Materials handled by the contractor under this requirement will generally be in the category of SECRET or below; there is the possibility that there may occasionally be a requirement that involves TOP SECRET material.

Contractor effort under this contract shall be available, as appropriate and with the consent of the Contracting Officer, to other elements of the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff.

Interested firms are requested to provide capability statements, not to exceed 10 pages, that include the following information: 1) Company name, address, point of contact name, telephone, and email address; 2) Business size status (Large, Small, 8(a), etc.); 3) Company experience - Where, when, and for whom have you done similar work before providing a brief description of each project; 4) Company capability - provide a general discussion of your capabilities and capacity to perform the above stated requirement; 5) Potential performance metrics - Describe what performance measurements would be appropriate for this effort, including the item to be measured, how the measurement would be accomplished, acceptable level of quality or performance, etc.

All responses shall be submitted by email.  Telephonic or verbal responses will not be accepted.  Email responses to marty.heule.ctr@whs.mil or ed.chevalier@whs.mil.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Notice of Intent to Negotiate a Sole Source Contract
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH), intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole-source contract with HomeFree Inc. to provide a wireless resident/patient monitoring system to include system training and an extended maintenance agreement. 

The AFRH requires that residents have the dignity and freedom to walk throughout the Campus's 200 plus wooded acres with multiple accessible buildings. For purposes of safety it is necessary to keep track of the 1,300 individual residents throughout the campus in a non-intrusive manner at all times. HomeFree Inc. is the only company that provides the products to meet the agency's goal of monitoring the residents in a dignified, inconspicuous, and non-intrusive manner at all times. 

The watch has multiple sensors, including strap tamper, body sensor and motion sensors described as follows: a) Strap Alerts - The watch will alert when the strap is open or cut, a message will be sent to the pagers indicating resident name and location. b) Body Sensor - In the event a resident is able to slide the watch off the hand, the body sensor will alert staff that the watch is removed. c) Motion Monitoring - The watch is equipped with a sensitive motion sensor indicating the residents' real-time motion level. Staff can set timeframes (e.g. night time) in which extensive motion readings will be reported. The system will also alert in the event a resident is motionless for a long period of time. 

The contractor will be required to install the monitoring system in seven buildings, designated outdoor areas, and other areas as required to provide total campus coverage. This installation will be at the AFRH's Washington, DC campus facility. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition is implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(2) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; when the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source. Firms that want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firm's ability to provide the above services. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within 15 days of the posting date of this notice.

<SUBJECT>B -- Renewable Energy Potential Initiative
<DESC>Estimates of the potential of renewable energy (RE) are needed to support decisions about energy investments and energy policy.  While some estimates for RE resource, technical, economic, and market potential have been made, they are not detailed or comprehensive.  Energy businesses, investors and public policymakers have expressed interest in using RE to meet a larger share of U.S. energy needs, but this would require more robust analysis of RE potential.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is seeking partners for developing a Renewable Energy Potential Initiative.  The major goal of the Renewable Energy Potential Initiative is to analyze and explore in a comprehensive and systematic manner the long-term potential of RE to support a substantial share of U.S. energy use.  NREL is a national laboratory owned by the Department of Energy and managed and operated by Midwest Research Institute and Battelle under DOE Contract No. DE-AC36-99-GO10337.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This justification and approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics’ Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department’s PKI program. The DOS PKI program uses Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers hard ware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers).  Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers.  Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration.  As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKI/BLADE  configuration. IRM/OPS/ITI/SI Requires Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers to be procured on a brand name only basis  Therefore, 41 USC 253©(1), only one responsible seller and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements , implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 is sited as statutory authority. Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers.  If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product.  Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware.  This is a product that the US Department of State Currently has installed.   Installation of different software versions may have the following issues: 1) Non compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations.  2) The Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers.  Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3) Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.

All groups would need to be networked to use the printers provided. Pipe & Drape - The site of the Plenary Sessions for the Summit is presently a large open space with pillars in an 1850's building.  It will need to be pipe and draped to provide an enclosed comfortable environment for the Plenary Sessions.  The space is approximately 300' by 300' to span with draping material.

It should be approximately 24 feet long and 12 feet deep, skirted with coordinating colors of the Summit. Rental furniture: --  Tthe site of the Plenary Sessions for the Summi, presently it is a large open space with pillars in an 1850's building.  There is no stage in the space.  A plenary session stage will need to be constructed for the presenters for the Sessions.  The stage will need up to 8 comfortable chairs and a podium (with room for the Summit logo on the front).   The Press availability room and the Summit communications offices will both need comfortable chairs to provide Government Officials and the media a way to interact in a comfortable manner.  The Press availability room should have a love seat and two matching chairs and a coffee table.  The Summit communications office should have - beside the tables and chairs provided by the hotel for work spaces - five comfortable chairs around a coffee table for the staff to use for internal meetings as well as meetings with working media. A/V - The stage should be flanked with Image magnification (Imags.) screens.  There will be a full stationary camera package for the center of the rear of the Plenary Session as well as one portable unit to be used as needed to augment the images of the speakers.  The podium microphone will feed into the sound system provided for the event and use speakers provided by the A/V company for the plenary sessions.  The Imags. will be using the images provided by the cameras and will need to provide power point images as required by the speakers.  Further, if there is a video presentation, the system will need to have that capability.  There will be a requirement to tape these sessions in a format to be compatible with news services and government agencies to use.   Streaming text/deaf interpretation - The spoken words of the speakers will need to be shown on the Imags for those in the plenary sessions that will need assistant in hearing what is said, but to not require sign language interpretation for the hearing disabled.

Beside the paper program, list of Summit participants, list of resource organizations, there will be other documents that may be required to assist the participants in making the Summit as success.  While the program, the list of participants, and the resource organizations will be designed and printed ahead of the Summit, there will need to be established an ability to print materials on an as needed basis during the Summit.  A contract with a local firm for all materials will reduce the cost of shipping the programs and other printed conference materials to the site of the Summit.  Signage - During the Summit each breakout session and evening event will need to be "branded" in order for participants to know they are in the correct location for their breakout session or evening event.   Signs with the Summit logo and reusable plastic sleeves for information pages should be created for use during the Summit.  The National  Park Service has appropriate specifications for these signs.

<SUBJECT>A -- Quantitative Tumor Size-Survival Relationships in Oncology Clinical Trials
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-1020531
<RESPDATE>091306
<ARCHDATE>09282006
<CONTACT>Angela  Dash, Contract Specialist , Phone 301-827-5094, Fax 301-827-7101, Email angela.dash@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO AWARD THIS PURCHASE ORDER AS A SOLE SOURCE TO:
JOO YEON LEE
1733 ANDERSON RD
FALLS CHURCH, VA  22043.

ANY INQUIRIES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO ANGELA DASH AT 301-827-5094.

Background:
Reliable biomarkers of clinical outcome can streamline drug development by reducing both the time and number of patients needed to demonstrate efficacy. In oncology drug trials, tumor size assessments obtained at baseline and repeatedly during treatment are used to determine the category of best response to the drug. The primary end-point in these trials, however, is survival. The relationship between response rates and survival, particularly the ability of response rates to predict survival in these trials, remains unclear. Additionally, there is a need to evaluate quantitative measures of tumor size, including model-based analyses of longitudinal tumor size data, which may permit more sensitive predictions of survival than categorical response rates that ignore tumor kinetics. 

The relationship between tumor size and survival will be examined for drugs used in the treatment of lung cancer, which has become the leading cause of cancer death in men and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in women. Mortality in women due to lung cancer has increased significantly over the last century, from 3% in 1950 to 22% in 1994. This project also aims to examine sex-related differences in disease progression and response to treatment in this disease, which could be substantially beneficial to women, as well as men.  

Objectives:
The overall objective of this project is to evaluate quantitative measures of aggregate tumor presence, both at baseline and after treatment, for their ability to predict survival in clinical trials of treatments for lung cancer. We also plan to test for any sex-related differences in the relationship between quantitative tumor measures and survival. Our goal is to quantify the impact of changes in aggregate tumor amount on patient outcome and identify any individual predictors of response. In doing so, we aim to develop analytic methodology to improve therapeutic development. 
This project is designed to create a standardized database of clinical information from randomized non-small cell lung cancer trials submitted to the Agency. After creating a database of survival, demographic, and tumor size data from trials of treatments for lung cancer, we will quantify relationships among patient characteristics, rates of tumor progression, and survival (treatment response).

Personnel:
Several individuals with diverse backgrounds will contribute to this research project. Investigators from CDER include clinical pharmacologists, pharmacometricians, statisticians and medical oncologists. As requested in this Memorandum of Need, a candidate is needed for data/information collection, database management and statistical analysis. A candidate with a MS or PhD or other equivalent training, with strong skills in statistics, modeling and database management is needed. Experience in the use of SAS, S-Plus and NONMEM is strongly desirable. 

Tasks and Deliverable Items: 
a)The Contractor shall survey NDA files and the necessary material as mentioned above to build a database across several lung cancer studies submitted to the Agency. This database will provide the knowledge base to conduct analyses to achieve the objectives of the study. 
b)The Contractor will access the datasets and create a repository and analyze data according to methods to be determined by the Investigators.

Deliverables Timeline:
Establish a repository of clinical trials in standard format - Weeks 1-8
Identify predictors of survival in clinical trials in the database - Weeks 8-46
Create a summary report of results - Weeks 46-52
Submit progress reports - Every 2 months
Update database as new data are submitted - Ongoing

Period of Performance:
Contractor for this segment of the project is needed from Date of Award to 10-Sept-2007.

Billing:
The contract will be set up as an invoice.  

Security Requirements:
The Contractor shall obtain FDA security clearance prior to beginning work.   Contractor shall sign a confidentiality agreement prior to beginning work under this contract.

Facilities:
Contractor shall conduct research in space provided by FDA. FDA will also provide appropriate equipment.

                  Infrared Camera Requirements

Resolution must be 600 X 400 or greater.  We will be using the IR camera to look at remote targets and need as much resolution as possible.  

IR Camera must be capable of taking IR and visual images.  We need a visual reference image with our thermals to properly document electrical faults.  IR cameras that do not have an integrated visual camera are unacceptable. 

IR camera should have a built in lamp to illuminate low light targets so that an acceptable visual reference image can be taken.  This is necessary for our application as many of our targets are in dark areas and require illumination for proper inspection.

Visual camera must be 1.1 mega pixels or greater. Visual camera must have interchangeable lenses to approximately match the Field of View of the available IR lenses.

Thermal and visual Images must be in JPEG format.  This will allow us to view these images in Microsoft Explorer as thumbnails or include in a Word Document.  JPEG’s also allow us to send images to anyone for review without requiring custom software to open.  Proprietary image formats are not acceptable.  Images that must be converted to a standard format are likewise not acceptable for our use.

Must have tilt-able viewfinder and built in 5” or larger LCD.

IR camera must have at least an 8 to 1 continuous zoom and pan.

IR camera must have auto focus and also be able to be focused manually by hand.

IR camera must have voice annotation.  

Camera must run for a minimum of 3 hours on a single battery.

Camera must weigh less than 4 lb.  

IR report generated must be a WORD Document.  Proprietary document formats are not acceptable for our intended use.

The CCR can be accessed at Internet address: www.ccr.gov/.  Confirmation of CCR registration will be validated prior to awarding a contract.      Evaluation Factors:  Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.   Provide the following information with your offer:  1. Technical Capabili ty.  If providing an equal, please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal.  NOTE:  Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard pro cedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient.  Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating.  2. Past Performance.  Vendors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires to two firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment.  Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote.  If a vendor provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award  decision.  It is the vendors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing date and time.  The Contracting Officer may  also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government.  Vendors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past perfo rmance information rests with the vendor. 3. Price.  4. Award will be on an all or none basis.      Evaluation Process:  All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well  as Technical Capability.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the ba sis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the Governments requirement.  2.  The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price and p rice related factors.  In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.  3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined , are significantly more important than Price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to be worth the high price premium.  The trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.

The solicitation is unrestricted and is associated with NAICS code 32120.  Statement of Work is as follows:  The division of Biophy sical Toxicology, located at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Walter Reed Medical Center, is a DoD laboratory that performs screening and follow up testing for depleted uranium and other trace metals in support of the United States Armed Forces, as well as various National, State, and local law enforcement agencies.  For the analysis we are using inductively couples plasma mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively couple plasma atomic emission spectrometry.  All of the abov e techniques use argon gas derived from high purity (99.997% Ar) liquid argon tanks.  Due to the quick evaporation of the gas, we can not maintain too many cylinders in the cage.  However, it is essential to have the argon gas available at all times which will result on the instrument to go down less times and thus increased analysis time.  Please note that all gas delivery must be prompt and must have a quick response time.  The supplier shall deliver all items ordered within three business days between th e hours of 9:00 AM and 3:30 PM on weekdays at no additional charge to the government. The supplier must provide MSDS sheets and certification of purity with all tanks ordered.  AFIP will order tanks weekly and no more than 80 tanks a year.

In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.

9.  Responses to questions posted on Sept. 6 indicated, ?the cost for assessment should not be factor for vendor providing service under this contract?.

Will EPA reconsider allowing the contractor to include such costs?

Contactor may include costs to administer a 360 assessment however; this contract does not require the client to have a 360 assessment.  The award money for this contract is for coaching services only.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is RFQ60068 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.     This is a total small business set-aside. The NAICS is 541690 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.

A.	The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a requirement for an evaluation of the level of usage of the NIDA Goes Back to School (NGBTS) National Dissemination Campaign.   The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the level of use by requestors of the NGBTS materials.  NIDA is presently developing a questionnaire to collect this via a Web survey, and is preparing a Supporting Statement to obtain OMB clearance for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.  To conduct this evaluation, NIDA requires the assistance of an experienced contractor to conduct the Web survey of requestors, and to analyze the information collected.

 The key study questions of this evaluation are: 1. Are the NGBTS materials disseminated being used by school personnel requestors, and by community leader requestors? 2. What has been the difference in use level in each year of the campaign? 3. Is there a difference in use level between those requestors responding to a campaign activity and those requestors who were not intervened by campaign activities? 4. What barriers to use of the materials are being reported by requestors?  The primary source information being proposed will have an inherent limitation due to memory recall, especially for the earliest year of the campaign. Secondary source information, from the requestor forms, will be used to verify information from the earliest year(s), and to determine its usability in the evaluation.  In addition, 
1.	The contractor shall conduct the information collection and analysis of the information using methodology agreed to by the IC staff. The contractor shall use all necessary methods to ensure that evaluation questions are answered based on the information collected. 

2.	The contractor shall submit, as part of the proposal, a preliminary implementation plan and briefing statement on the database, for the evaluation services to be provided based on the information provided in this Statement of Work. 

3.	The following is a list of required tasks for completion of this contract. This list is not all-inclusive. The tasks are listed sequentially; however, several tasks will be done concurrently, and some tasks will be continued throughout the entire contract period. 

Specifically, the contractor shall:

Task 1.    The contractor will present a briefing statement to the NIDA Project Officer and IC staff, on the database of the requestors and the items of information in the database of relevance to the evaluation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the database, the potential gaps in the available information will be described, a description of how the contractor works with the gaps in the information analysis presently being conducted will be provided. The contractor will provide a brief work plan to describe how the evaluation services will be conducted, and a preliminary analysis plan.
 
Task 2.    The contractor will draft a sampling plan for random sampling from the database of requestors who ordered materials in the years of the campaign. The sampling plan will include sampling of intervened requestors, and of non-intervened requestors.  Stratified sampling will be used as necessary, to ensure adequate representation among the different sub-group comparisons that NIDA will need to answer the evaluation questions. The sampling plan will be designed to yield accurate information with the appropriate representation of the population and its characteristics such as the geographic regions/socioeconomic regions that the requestors are located in. The sampling plan will minimize non-response error.

Task 3.   The contractor will conduct sample selection from the database according to the sampling plan.  Based on its experience with these groups of requestors the contractor will use its expertise for maximizing response rates and dealing with non-responses, as necessary for a one-time participation event. 
 
Task 4.  The contractor will review the questionnaires prepared by NIDA for the school personnel and community leader requestors, and make recommendations to the IC staff, based on the experience with Internet survey taking and response rates.  The contractor will finalize the questionnaires with the revisions as needed, on information from the pilot tests of the instruments and as advised by NIDA project staff.

Task 5.   The contractor will draft the email request to participate in the survey for review by the NIDA Project Officer, and will make revisions to the email request as necessary. 

Task 6.  Upon NIDA obtaining OMB clearance, the contractor will upload the finalized questionnaires into the web survey tool to be used in the study. 

Task 7.  The contractor will conduct the survey. The contractor will review the incoming response forms to track incomplete forms needing a subsequent email request, and to track non-respondents. The contractor will conduct accuracy checks for consistency in the responses and to minimize response error to the extent possible. Such items as name of requestor, place of employment, could be matched on information in the requestor forms used in the study.  Non-matches will be tracked for reconciliation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the requestor population, subsequent email requests will be sent to participants for reconciliation or phone calls will be made if a contact number is provided. Response forms with irreconciliable error will be excluded from the study.   

Task 8. The contractor will prepare the information for analysis.  Analyses will be conducted blinded and in the aggregate. Excel formats will be prepared for extracting information from the response forms, to maximize accuracy, consistency, and standardization in extraction for the anticipated quantitative and qualitative analyses. The contractor will develop a database of the survey information, blinded for all personal identification of the requestors. 

Task 9.   The contractor will conduct analyses of the blinded information. Analyses will be focused to answer the evaluation questions. Descriptive quantitative analyses will be conducted. Qualitative information will be analyzed using qualitative methods that will be appropriate for the information and relevant to the purpose of information collected.  The contractor will work with IC staff to determine the most appropriate analytic methods needed for the information obtained. The contractor will conduct the analyses. The analyses will be reviewed by IC staff and make recommendations as necessary. The contractor will incorporate recommendations, and summarize the results from analyses in a PowerPoint presentation and a final report. 
    	All information materials developed pursuant to this contract are the property of the U.S. Government and fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act. The contractor is enjoined against unauthorized release of the facts, findings, and written materials from this contract without the expressed, written authorization of the Task Leader. 

Each deliverable shall include, at a minimum, information as described in each task above. For the purpose of this schedule, week 1 shall be considered to be the first week after the contract award date.

Contractor shall provide and install polished porcelain tile deck covering.  No QPL or Mil-Spec currently exists for these materials.  All products must meet the requirements of commercial standard A137.1.  A copy of this standard can be obtained from: Tile Council of America, Inc., 100 Clemson Research Blvd., Anderson, SC 29625, phone: 864-646-8453, fax:864-646-2821, URL: http:/www.tileusa.com.  Contractor shall Contractor shall remove existing deck covering down to bare metal surface.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with NSTM Section 631.  Install an underlayment, adhesive and grout that is epoxy based.  The cement based underlayment products available will not hold up under forklift traffic.  The compressive strength is not high enough, and the underlayment has been seen to crumble, leading to failures and breakage of the porcelain tiles.  Additionally, the underlayment may not fully cure in the center of the non-permeable tiles.  Therefore, contractor shall provide ultra-lightweight underlayment (<1.0 lb/sf @ 1/4") that meets QPL-3135, Type II, Class 2, and that the adhesive and grout are also epoxy based.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new porcelain tiles throughout entire areas specified iaw best commercial standards for this type of product and the fact that it is being installed on board a U.S. Navy ship.  A rubber leveler coat is authorized once underlayment base is established.  Contractor shall understand how critical this deck leveling stage is to the overall success of the installation.  An non-leveled surface could result in deck failure and be reason for contract default for latent defect and or non-conformance to the specifications herein.  Recommend using a 3/8 notched trowel and back butter the tile 100% for a nice level setting bed when installing border and field tiles.  Ship's representative shall choose Crossville tile style, size, color selection and final design.

Contractors need to certify upon submission of their proposals that they are quoting iaw RFQ and Amendment 0001.
