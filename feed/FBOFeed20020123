<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is seeking a certified Health and Human Services Laboratory Contractor to provide personnel, equipment, and materials necessary to support NIJ's Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring program by processing urine specimens that are generated by this program and work directly with the ADAM Data Collection Contractor (DCC).  This requirement shall be for four years (base year plus three option years).  The ADAM DCC will collaborate with NIJ on the design, implementation, and management of
 the ADAM program.  The ADAM DCC is the National Opinion Research Center, 1155 East 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637.  The contract number is OJP-2001-C-003.  The ADAM program will operate in a minimum of 35 sites and a maximum of 75 sites throughout the United States by the end of the second contract option year, fiscal year 2005. The expansion is subject to modification based on future decisions made by NIJ that will be dependent on potential funding and policy redirection.  The contractor shall follow the guidelines that are current operating procedures and any modified procedures in place for the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program.  The anticipated ADAM data collection procedures are as follows: In each site, for approximately 2 weeks every quarter, trained interviewers will collect voluntary and anonymous interviews and urine specimens from adult male, adult female, juvenile male, and juvenile female booked arrestees.  On occasion, additional bioassay will be collected from sampled arrestees.  Interview data will detail, among other things, self reports of drug use. Urine specimens shall be screened. Names or other personal identifiers will not be collected, but a common ID number shall be attached to the interview form,  the specimen container, and any addenda instruments so that information from a specific interview can be matched to a specific specimen.  The Urine specimens will be screened for a panel of ten drugs and all amphetamine positives will be confirmed by GC/MS for methamphetamine positives.  

Each site shall send urine specimens to a central laboratory where the specimens will be screened for a minimum of ten drugs. The results shall be delivered to DCC both via mail and email. At DCC, the urinalysis results will then be merged with the interview data, analyzed by DCC and/or NIJ, and reported on a quarterly and annual basis. It is strongly recommended that applicants review past ADAM publications and annual reports.   Recent ADAM publications may be obtained from the National Institute of Justice/National Criminal Justice Reference Service, Box 600, Rockville, MD 20850, by phone at 1-800-851-3420 or on the web at askncjrs@ncjrs.org, or at the ADAM web site at www.adam-nij.net.

At each site, urine specimens will be separated by gender and by age groups -- adult male, adult female, juvenile female, and juvenile male -- and will be boxed separately, and then mailed to the laboratory. Since sites collect data over a 10-day to 3-week period, urine specimens will usually be mailed in batches. Urine specimens will not usually be refrigerated at the site, but will be normally mailed within one to three days of data collection. After the last box of urine specimens for a gender/age group is shipped out, the site will fax an End-of-Batch notification (Attachment VI) to both DCC and Laboratory contractor to indicate  that data collection for that gender/age group has been completed.

Data collection shall take place on a quarterly basis in each site on a staggered schedule. Thus, in a given calendar quarter, it will be likely that at least one site will be collecting data in any given month. In addition, adult and juvenile specimens will usually be collected at different times within each quarter.

In contract option year-3, each site shall collect data through an outreach program on an annual basis in coordination with the Local Coordinating Councils (LCC). The outrea

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The United States Naval Facilities Engineering Command issues a Second Notice of Intent for the construction of Overlay Runway 11-29, NAS Keflavik, Iceland. The work includes application of a 50mm overlay to the entire length of runway 11-29 at NAS Keflavik, Iceland, with the exception of the intersection with runway 02-20. Removal by milling of deteriorated bituminous pavement and micro-surfacing prior to the new overlay, transition milling and new bituminous surface course at adjoining airfield pavements is required.  Deteriorated bituminous pavement at numerous locations throughout the runway will be milled and replaced with a 50mm thick bituminous concrete prior to overlaying.  The deteriorated surface of both overrun areas will be milled and resurfaced.  The bituminous mix design will require highly durable aggregate not locally available.  The overlay will raise the centerline and some flush-mounted sideline lighting using extension collars.  On completion of the overlay and resurfacing the pavements, the entire runway and both overrun areas will be re-marked.  This work will require coordination with other on-going airfield restoratio work.
All applicants must be cetified by the NATO procurement officer at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Telecommunications Technologies. Please submit all requests to be nominated to Alexis Kemper (fax: 202-482-5834) by COB 01 February 2002.

<DESC>Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost.  Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations.  For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users.  Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference.  Therefore there is a need for both (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) affordable reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.  In the past two years, ONR has been conducting a series of Science and Technology Projects in (1) GPS Anti-jam Technology, (2) Tightly Coupled GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) devices, (3) Atomic Clock Development and (4) Non-GPS Navigation Devices/Systems such as Bathymetric Navigation and Gravity Gradiometer Navigation.

Objective and Areas of Interest: The Office of Naval Research (ONR 313) seeks proposals for efforts that aim to develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation concepts, devices, and systems in navigation and timekeeping.  Specific areas of interest include: GPS User Equipment; Next Generation GPS System applications to Naval and Maritime Platforms; GPS M-Code Applications; GPS Embedded Engines; Military Pseudolite approaches; Inertial Navigation Systems (INS); Quartz Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs); Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS); Small Stable Clocks; Time Transfer Technology; Distributed Time Standards; the integration of multiple navigation/timing technologies/systems in unified communications/ navigation/ identification (CNI) architectures; focussed and/or multidisciplinary concepts that develop/apply new antenna/array technologies, such as Anti-Jam Antennas; Advanced Signal Processing; Multi-sensor/multi-tracking filter; Multi-tracking filter Improved Algorithms; Celestial Navigation Systems; Navigation Simulation; and other ideas for next generation concepts, devices, and systems that apply to navigation and timekeeping. 

Available Funding Levels, Period of Performance and Expected Award Instrument: Individual proposals are desired in the cost and period of performance range set forth below:

- Yearly Funding:	        Up to $500,000/year
- Period of Performance:	Up to three years
- Total Amount of Award:	Up to $1.5M

ONR anticipates that funding will be available to make a total of approximately four (4) awards using applied research (category 6.2) or advanced technology (category 6.3) funds, as appropriate.  Proposals for less than the maximum dollar award/performance period are welcomed. Awards will primarily be in the form of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts. However, the Government reserves the right to award grants, cooperative agreements, or other transaction agreements to appropriate parties, should the situation warrant use of a non-contractual instrument.  

General Requirements for White Papers and Full Proposals: White papers/full proposals should be submitted to the following address: Office of Naval Research, Ballston Tower One, Attn: Sheila Richardson, Rm. 619, 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5660.  The information submitted in the white papers/full proposals must be unclassified.  However, classified work can be proposed under an offered project as long as no classified information is included in the white papers/proposals.  White paper/full proposal submissions must be in hard copy, with one (1) original copy and nine (9) photocopies. White papers/full proposals submitted electronically or by fax will not be considered eligible.  Font should be 12-point, Times New Roman.  The page limitations s

This is not a notice for solicitation.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting market research with regard to the acquisition of services of a skilled and experienced staff to manage and operate the Optical Sciences Laboratory (OSL) within the USGS National Mapping Program, Eastern Region Geographic Science Center.  The OSL is the only full service laboratory in the Western Hemisphere for the precise calibration of civilian aerial mapping camera systems and lenses used in the aerial mapping programs of all State and Federal agencies.  The OSL primarily performs Camera Calibration Tests on precision aerial mapping/reconnaissance cameras and their components to determine their geometric accuracy when compared to a known measured target standard.  These tasks are described in the 'Calibration of Aerial Mapping Cameras Procedure Manual' and many have been learned via years of on- the- job training.  Based on the information currently available, the USGS considers the required services to be sole-source and plans to enter into non-competitive discussions with the The Orkand Corporation of Falls Church, VA.  Requests for a copy of the Statement of Work and the 'Calibration of Aerial Mapping Cameras Procedure Manual' may be made by e-mailing the Contracting Officer- Sharon McDowell at smcdowell@usgs.gov or faxing a request at 703/648-7367.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses to this synopsis should contain sufficient descriptive literature describing the ability to provide these services.  Responses will be evaluated to determine whether a potential firm has full knowledge and capabilities to meet the USGS' requirement.  An on-site Operational Capabilities Demonstration (OCD) will be required of all potential vendors.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this synopsis. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  All responses to this request must be received by close of business February 7, 2002.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>19--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT -- LANDING CRAFT UTILITY REPLACEMENT PROGRAM, LCU(R) CONCEPTS, STUDIES AND ANALYSES
<DESC>Points of Contact: 
Contracting Officer: Stephen V. Piasecki, SEA 02222, 202-781-2969, piaseckisv@navsea.navy.mil or Richard D. Braendel II, SEA 02222B, 202-781-0481, braendelr@navsea.navy.mil

The Naval Sea Systems Command and the Program Executive Officer, Expeditionary Warfare (PEO EXW) are seeking information from interested sources toward a potential future replacement of the LCU 1600 Class Utility Craft.  (The nature and format of the information requested is discussed later in this announcement.)  The LCU(R) will provide a technologically advanced, heavy lift, utility landing craft to complement the high speed, over-the-horizon, ship-to-objective amphibious lift required by Operational Maneuver - From the Sea (OMFTS) and Seabased Logistics. Primary and Secondary missions, Required Operational Capabilities, Threat and Threat Environment, Constraints, and Operational Environment for the LCU(R) are depicted in the LCU(R) Mission Need Statement (MNS). The MNS and other official LCU(R) documents that can be found on the LCU(R) web site at http://lcur.navsea.navy.mil.

The craft will be built to ABS and commercial standards, specifications and practices.  The production contract will specify the preliminary delivery of two (2) Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) craft in FY06 for operational testing and evaluation. Upon completion of the testing period, estimated at twelve(12) months or less, the government will authorize Full Scale Production (FSP) of the remaining craft (presently set at 14 to 22 craft).

Note: The current SCN budget is about $60M/yr and is based on the replacement of five (5) LCU per year for a duration of seven (7) years starting with a "Best Value" contract award in FY05.

The current status of the LCU(R) program is as follows: The LCU(R) Program is in the Concept and Technology Development Phase. The objective of this phase is to obtain Concept and Feasibility Design Studies from Industry for the purpose of developing a Performance Specification (PS) that will respond to the LCU(R) Mission Need Statement (MNS) and Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The Performance Specification will be the Technical Data Package used to award a multi-craft procurement contract starting in FY05. It is planned that any procurement for the production of the LCU(R) will be on a competitive basis, regardless of whether the offerors participated in any of the LCU(R) design phases.

As part of the Concept and Technology Development Phase, a BAA (PSA 2754) similar to this BAA, was issued 26 December 2000 for concept papers that would lead to the awards of contracts for Feasibility Design Studies.  The December 2000 BAA anticipated an LCU(R) design with a maximum 30-ft beam. Upon review of the white papers submitted in response to BAA (PSA 2754), contracts were awarded to ten (10) of the participants to conduct Feasibility Design Studies (FDS).  No contract awards for the development of a Performance Specification have been made as a result of the 30-ft. beam Feasibility Design Studies.  

Contractors, which received contracts for Feasibility Design Studies in June 2001, may not submit another proposal or proposals under the BAA described below.

This BAA is for Feasibility Design Studies for an LCU(R) with a maximum 45-ft beam.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is being developed by the Center for Naval Analysis (CNA) to evaluate the operational effectiveness and estimated cost of alternative systems. The studies resulting from this BAA are, in part to support the AoA in determining number and size of craft necessary to meet LCU(R) mission needs and required operational capabilities.  Final AoA report is due late May 2002, upon which the Navy will decide an alternative to pursue in order to best meet its overall amphibious lift requirements. This decision is not expected to take place until June/July 2002 time frame.

<SUBJECT>A -- BAA 02-01  Submarine Escape, Rescue and Divers Safety Effectiveness Research and Development
<DESC>BAA 02-01:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWC DD COAST SYSTA), Panama City, Florida is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied biomedical research focusing on Submarine Escape, Rescue, Diving Safety, and Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more details below. It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be opened for a period of two years from the date of this publication (or until 1/22/2004). However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2003.

(1) Primary Interests

This program?s objective is to focus on diving and submarine rescue survivability and escape research that can be rapidly transitioned to fleet capabilities by improved procedures or increased levels of safety and survivability.  The typically project will be two years or less although three year projects are considered.  

The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are:  (1) increasing survival in a disabled submarine to seven days through improved carbon dioxide removal, control of oxygen at non-toxic levels, improved measurement and control of atmospheric contaminants, prevention of pressure build-up, prevention of hypothermia, and improved first aid measures for trauma and illness; (2) extending the capability for escape to depths deeper than 600 feet through improved escape procedures and equipment;  (3) extending the capability for rescue under pressure to 5 ATA through novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression; and (4) improving medical treatment of escape and rescue casualties though improved diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, better definition of surface interval risk, better techniques to triage casualties, non-recompressive treatments of decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, and techniques for management of hypothermia in hyperbaric chambers.

The areas of primary interest in diving safety and effectiveness are:  (1) objective diagnostic test(s) for DCS and AGE; (2) prospective and/or retrospective studies of the risk associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO);  (3) improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE) in humans though imaging of damaged tissue, non-invasive measurement of intramedulary pressure in bone, measurement of electrophysiological, immunological, and biochemical correlates of DCS and AGE; (4) improving the safety and effectiveness of diving in contaminated water through development of  field-deployable screening tests for biologic and chemical contamination, improved laboratory assays for contaminants in salt and brackish water, estimates of the amount of contaminated water inhaled and swallowed with different classes of diving equipment, estimates of chemical absorption rates through wet skin, development of decontamination techniques including rapid decontamination techniques that will allow employment of surface decompression tables, and improved risk assessment and management techniques (Current contaminated water scenarios of greatest interest are fuel oils, human remains, PCB's, and heavy metals); (5) improving ability of free-swimming and tethered divers to operate in thermal extremes (both hot and cold) through improved suit materials, insulating materials, heat exchangers, and heat storage devices, and through physiologic study to determine optimal warming and cooling methods; (6) improving decompression procedures through human studies on the optimal placement of decompression stops and optimal use of oxygen during decompression, use of nitrogen to accelerate decompression from helium-oxygen dives, and quantification of acclimation and "over decompression" phenomena in divers; (7) minimizing the risk of oxygen poisoning through improved understanding of cerebral blood flow / arterial CO2 relationships,   improved central n

<SUBJECT>R -- Rural Power of Poverty Reduction (RPPR) Program in Bangladesh
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to 
Bangladesh intends to award a five-year contract to National Rural Electric 
Cooperative Authority (NRECA) to implement the final stage of the Rural Power 
for Poverty Reduction Program (RPPR-II) in Bangladesh. The authority for this 
non-competitive procurement is AID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) 706.302-70, 
Impairment of Foreign Aid Programs. A justification and approval for other 
than full and open competition has been prepared based on AIDAR 
706.302-70(b)(5); the award is for the continued provision of highly 
specialized services when award to another resource would result in 
unacceptable delays to the program. The primary purpose for extending further 
support to the Bangladesh Rural Electrification program is to ensure the 
sustainability Mof the rural electrification effort through a well-planned 
program phase-out. USAID believes NRECA is uniquely situated for this award 
given that they are currently mobilized in the field with staff and 
monitoring systems already in place, the existing program was created based 
on a model developed by NRECA, and NRECA has established a collaborative 
working relationship with the Government of Bangladesh's Rural 
Electrification Board (REB) and the Rural Electric Cooperatives (PBSs) that 
would take several years to replicate. NRECAs long-term association with the 
Bangladesh Rural Electrification Program has promoted the development of a 
strong working relationship between NRECA, the REB and the vast network of 
PBSs. Since this program is closely patterned after NRECAs U.S. Program, 
REB/PBSs have strong confidence that NRECA understands their organization and 
the challenges they face. The trust and congenial relationships that have 
been established between NRECA and the Bangladesh partners are invatluable in 
terms of accomplishing our Rural Electrification objectives. Placing a new 
contractor in the field at this stage, no matter how qualified, would be 
disruptive and not understood by Bangladeshis, particularly when this is the 
final stage of the program. It is, therefore, the opinion of USAID that 
mobilization of a new contract team would undermine the successful phase out 
of USAID's assistance to the Rural Electrification program. Qualified 
companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to the 
requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive 
proposals. However, submissions received before January 31, 2002 will be 
considered by the Government. Information received will normally be 
considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a 
competitive procurement. NAICS: 541690  Competition Level: Sole Source, and
