<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to partner with the Optical Society of America (OSA) in the development and evaluation of a prototype biomedical interactive archive, and associated journal, which will allow viewing and analysis of curated, supplemental biomedical source data, published in conjunction with a peer reviewed manuscript.  The newest generation of biomedical instrumentation allows unprecedented measurement precision and accuracy, providing the potential for transforming diagnostic medicine into a truly quantitative science.  Data associated with medical research and clinical trials is currently often sequestered and not available to the greater scientific community for analysis and review.   Moreover, convenient tools for viewing and analyzing the data are not generally available, source data is often only indirectly linked to journal articles, and digital data is published in non-standard formats with limited ability to search metadata characterizing the associated measurements.

The OSA is the world?s leading scientific society devoted to advancing the science of light.  OSA members are actively involved in developing advanced imaging and spectroscopic biomedical instrumentation such as: optical coherence tomography, photo-refractive keratectomy, diffuse optical imaging, and confocal microscopy.  Three OSA journals are currently indexed in Medline.  Over the past two years OSA has been actively investigating developing a Biomedical Archive Network Center to provide an infrastructure for collecting and archiving biomedical source data and associated metadata, and providing the links to peer reviewed articles describing the research and clinical studies which generated the data.

OSA and NLM propose to develop a prototype interactive e-journal with links to source data and associated metadata, providing the research and clinical communities with unprecedented data access and analysis tools.  This is not a request for proposals.  NLM believes that the OSA is the only biomedical publisher with journals indexed in Medline which has already made the necessary infrastructure investment to successfully publish an open-access prototype interactive e-journal within a one year time frame.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with MI Technologies, Inc., 1125 Satellite Blvd., STE 100 Suwanee, GA 30024-4629 for the purchase of the following item: 

ITEM 1: Microwave Receiver Upgrade
QTY: 1
P/N: MI-1797B-11
DESCRIPTION: Consisting of MU-1797B-11 High Performance Receiver 0.1-20 GHz; MI-3393 LO Extender; MI-1797-IL-025 (MI-1797 IF TO LO/IF Cable, 25 ft); MI-3390 Local to Remote Control Cable 60 FT; Engineering Support and Material Installation and Operator Familiarization Operator and Manuals.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334290.

Sole Source Justification:

MI Technologies is the only source that can provide a direct replacement that is both physically and electrically compatible with our current measurement system. Extensive software has been written which interfaces the AFRL measurement to the existing MI receiver. If anything other than a new MI receiver is purchased, AFRL will have to develop a whole new array of interface software and possibly be required to purchase additional interface hardware. This would be a lengthy and expensive undertaking which could severely impact the schedule of ongoing test efforts. In particular, this system is currently being utilized to perform measurements for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program, which directly supports homeland defense. MI Technologies is the only company capable of producing the microwave receiver which directly supports AFRL/IFGE?s existing antenna data acquisition system.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:     The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM), 1800 N Kent Street Suite 1060, Arlington, VA 22209.  The proposed acquisition will be for one base year with four one-year options for technical and administrative support for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) Task Force; to include developing plans to resolve GMDSS implementation problems, facilitating meetings, and supporting development of recommendations for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Subcommittee on Communications, Search and Rescue (COMSAR).  The GMDSS now being implemented by the IMO has charged the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention to provide a major upgrade of maritime safety communications procedures and equipment.  This upgrade will affect not only SOLAS ships over 300 tons, but all users of marine radio services. The GMDSS transition period ended February 1999 with most ships converted, however many shore implementation actions are incomplete. Therefore, the USCG and other government agencies cognizant of this issue have sponsored a National GMDSS Implementation Task Force to facilitate the transition and recommend further action.  The most appropriate North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 813920, Professional Organizations, with a small business size standard not to exceed $6,500,000.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  All capability statements received by 5:00 PM EST on 01 June 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determination whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>Attached is a Draft RFP for advanced planning, review and comments for the MOUT Training Systems.  Please note the planned pre-solication conference details in Section L of the RFP.  This Draft RFP contains a full set of CLINs desingated for East Coast installations; however, it only has a partial set for the West Coast and OCONUS.  For your review, consider the the East Coast CLINS to be duplicated in full for the West Coast and OCONUS.  The RFP attachemnt will be re-released as it's updated and completed. This effort is for a Worldwide Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract for the production, test, installation, and delivery of the USMC Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Training Systems located at U. S. Marine Corps or other DOD Installations.  The contractor shall perform a mix of engineering analysis, design, fabrication, and installation of MOUT Training Systems. Extensive studies by the Marine Corps War Fighting Laboratory has shown that units trained to operate an integrated combined arms team are more successful within the urban battle space and suffer fewer casualties.  This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world operations in the Third World.  MOUT Training Systems are required in order for the Marine Corps to conduct quality and credible Advanced Urban Warfare Training.  MOUT Training Systems will primarily be used for company and battalion force-on-force and force-on-target maneuver training.   Non live fire training typically utilizes  Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) ammunition and/or Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) equipment.  Live fire training typically utilizes 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, and 50 caliber ballistics.  Individual MOUT Training Systems may be used exclusively for non-live fire training, live fire training, or a combination!   of both.   The MOUT Training System will provide a realistic environment to support a variety of training tasks related to the deployment and maneuver in an urban setting and enable Marines to conduct training in an environment replicating realist third world urban conditions.  The training system will provide a challenging and complex urban training environment replicating the difficulties Marine units will face as they communicate, coordinate, maintain situational awareness, navigate, execute, and track urban operations.  The MOUT Training System also allows Marine units to master the challenges of urban navigation, movement, target acquisition and engagement, and cross boundary coordination.  The MOUT Training System provides Marine units a full range of tactical challenges from humanitarian relief efforts to peacekeeping and law enforcement to direct combat that might be encountered in a complex urban setting within a relatively brief timeframe or a small physical area – known as t!  he “three block war”.   To accomplish the realistic third-world training mission, the MOUT Training System may be configured to include the following functional components:  Government, Industry, Education, Commercial, Medical, Religious, Public Areas (including Athletic Fields and Plazas).  Some of the components are live fire and non-live fire environments.  These components are comprised of non-permanent building structures constructed of various materials.  The structure, character, density, and features of each town, village, zone, or district reflect logical functions that are typical within that setting (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, recreation, religious, etc.). This annoucement is for advanced planning, review and comments and in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided. It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Subpart 13.5 -- Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (as supplemented with additional information included in this notice). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-07-Q-5226 applies and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved. The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Bruker AXS Inc.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This acquisition is for two X-ray diffractometer systems, one with hot stage and one with 2-D detector.  The systems meet the following specifications required for analysis: Both systems: •	Spacious safety cabinets with door opening 30 x 40 inches to allow access for user-designed environmental chambers and other experiments •	Theta-theta goniometer with minimum step size 0.001 degree; accurate to better than 0.01 degrees throughout entire range; stepper motor design for rapid position location •	Tube stand accepts standard design ceramic tubes •	System and software capable of convenient microdiffraction profiles across samples using small beam, 2-D detector, and laser/video alignment system, including computer programming of locations •	Software written for Windows XP, includes goniometer control, includes search, structure solution, profile fitting, Rietvelt refinement, quantitative measurements, stress measurement, and texture analysis Powder diffraction system: •	1-Dimensional Compound Si Strip Detector, at least 3.5° coverage at 435 mm Texture system: •	Theta/theta goniometer similar to above, including third ring with laser alignment video microscope •	Centric ¼-Circle Eulerian cradle with Chi circle motorized range –11 to 98 degrees, Phi circle motorized infinite range •	Motorized X-Y-Z positioning with 80x80x2 mm range •	2-D Multiwire detector, based on a sealed proportional counter technology, with minimum 11 cm diameter aperture, integrated pre-amplification circuit, and over 1000x1000 pixel resolution; detector is true photon counter with zero dark signal The Bruker AXS systems are the only known systems that meet all of the above specificatiosn and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by August 22, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Loop Stability Analysis System. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the Loop Stability Analysis System, NI GPIB-USB-HS, Injection Transformer Kit, Clip-On Injection Transformer, 100A Input/Output Impedance Measurement Set, and Calibration Certification from Venable Industries. Venable Inc. is the only company to meet all the requirements stated below. The Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) requires the use of a frequency response analyzer to measure and test the load impedance rating upon the specifications for any new electrical power consuming equipment that enters into the space craft system. To perform this test, JSC must input an AC signal from a frequency analyzer which will be coupled by a transformer to form a normalized base DC input impedance. In order for the transformer to couple the AC signal the current rating requirement of 100 amps must be met. This rating ensures that there will not be a core saturation that will alter the test results. The system must also meet the magnitude limit over the frequency range of 50Hz to 100kHz. The minimum load input impedance is identified to avoid potential stability problems with the electrical power system (EPS) and an electrical power consuming equipment (EPCE) with insufficient input filtering. This system provides a frequency range of .01Hz to 2.2MHz. By meeting the specified frequency range, and possessing a frequency analyzer that can read lower range impedance, JSC can easily identify the impedance level sooner before reaching the bounded 50Hz to 100kHz range.	  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 3, 2007.

<DESC>Hardware and software techniques are sought for protection of DoD critical technologies (CT).  The focus of this effort is to discover innovative anti-tamper hardware and software techniques to aid in the protection of Critical Electronics Technology and/or COTS hardware within which critical program information (CPI) or critical information (CI) software (i.e., algorithms) are executed.    Volume protection concepts should address detection of tamper attempts and an appropriate penalty as the result of the tamper attempt.  Thought should be given to reliability of the product as well as flexibility in assessing a significant penalty if tamper is detected.   Anti-tamper techniques should be capable of lengthy unattended and unpowered environments.  The anti-tamper techniques should have low probability of false alarm as well as very high probability of detection of a tamper attempt.  Methods of destruction of small electronic parts techniques are desired.  AT techniques are most effective if they are undetectable in the host system architecture and they protect CPI without giving any direct indication that the tamper event has occurred.

<DESC>NASA seeks information from industry to assist in addressing global issues affecting the Agency's overall strategy for Commercial Space Transportation Services.  The information will facilitate acquisition planning for future procurements.  The primary purpose of this RFI is to collect information on key parameters that would help NASA refine and mature the acquisition plan for procuring safe, cost effective, and reliable ISS logistics re-supply services. The information will assist in Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 2 planning.  This information will also be used for future acquisition planning for other payloads to orbit. ISS Requirements: 1.	Cargo Delivery and Return/Disposal Capability -- Typical missions could include delivery to the International Space Station (ISS) of approximately 2000 - 3000 Kilograms (Kg) of pressurized and/or un-pressurized cargo with the first mission needed as early as last quarter FY2010.   Cargo disposal and/or return capability is also desired.   A portion of the cargo delivery, return/disposal complement will not be determined until a short period of time prior to launch.  Typical cargo characteristics are provided as a reference.  NASA is also interested in delivery and return/disposal capability that does not specifically match the described mission.   2.	Rendezvous, Proximity Operations and On Orbit attached Operations -- Transportation will include rendezvous and proximity operations for docking/berthing to the ISS and on orbit attached operations.  The provider will, at a minimum, need to meet the ISS COTS Interface Requirements Document, SSP 50808, for these activities. 3.	Launch and On Orbit Support Services -- Several mission services will be required for the end to end ISS resupply mission.  These will include standard services at the launch and landing sites for manifest specific cargo processing that could include offline laboratories, oxygen, nitrogen, and water; standard ground support equipment required to load pressurized and un-pressurized cargo; flight support equipment to accommodate pressurized and un-pressurized cargo on the vehicle providing resupply services to the ISS; and contractor provided operations control centers needed for launch and on orbit operations.   Future Payload to Orbit Requirements:  -- Typical missions could include delivery of approximately 1600 - 3000 Kg payload to a circular sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 675 Kilometers.  NASA is also interested in delivery capability that does not specifically match the described mission.	 Responders are invited to provide information regarding transportation capabilities that meet the NASA requirements noted above.  Provide any clarification on cost, technical, or schedule drivers or restrictions, and any suggestions to improve mission flexibility and reliability.   NASA is specifically requesting the following information: 1.	Company Information      a.	Company name, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address.     b.	Major development activities underway related to this transportation service.     c.	Provide sufficient information to determine if your company qualifies as a United States commercial provider of space transportation services as defined in Public Law 105-303, Commercial Space Act of 1998, meets the U.S. National Space Transportation Policy of 2004, and the Iran-Syria Non Proliferation Act. 2.  ISS Cargo/Re-supply Transportation Services Capability  Provide a description of current and planned capability:  a.	Launch site/infrastructure - include launch and landing sites. b.	Production/annual launch capability - include general description of manufacturing/production template, vehicle processing flows and turnaround, and number of flights and upmass/downmass that optimally may be accommodated in a year.   c.	Plan and schedule for demonstrating commercial space transportation services, including orbital rendezvous/proximity operations, and operational readiness to provide these services to the public and private sectors.  Indicate whether your interest is as a prime or subcontractor. d.	Estimated lead time from mission authorization to proceed (ATP) to launch. e.	Facilities and corresponding acquisition plans. 3.  Safety, Programmatic, and Technical Risk  a.	Describe the safety, programmatic, and technical risks you consider to be the drivers from a program execution perspective and any mitigating actions that may be appropriate for NASA to consider in its planning.  b.	Provide suggestions for accommodating launch date flexibility (i.e., late determination of launch date, changes in launch date, etc.) and specific cargo manifest changes while minimizing cost impacts. c.	Provide feedback on the application of, or elements within, the following NASA policy directives - NPD 8610.7, Launch Services Risk Mitigation Policy for NASA-Owned and/or NASA-Sponsored Payloads/Missions and NPD 8610.23, Launch Vehicle Technical Oversight Policy (http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov	 ).  What is NASA doing, as a result of these policies, that could be changed or eliminated without increasing launch risk?   What items are driving service cost without adding significant benefit?  Discuss risks and benefits to NASA and the supplier for any of your proposed changes in these oversight/insight policies. d.	Suggest ways NASA can incentivize a service supplier to provide safe, cost effective, and reliable services. 4.  Acquisition Terms and Conditions  Responders are invited to provide suggestions on what terms and conditions are beneficial for industry and NASA for this service. a.	Describe and provide rationale for the desired type of pricing in a fixed price service contract (e.g., fixed price by launch vehicle class, fixed price per mass or volume or other unit measure of payload capacity).  Address any known or potential risks associated with your recommended arrangement and provide any appropriate mitigation techniques.  b.	Suggest terms and conditions to implement the incentive approaches described in your response to Section 3. c.	Provide comments on unique ways mission success could be measured for ISS cargo missions.  Note:  Due to on orbit timeline constraints, specific cargo condition may not be immediately verified upon receipt on the ISS. d.	Provide recommendations regarding payment schedules, milestone events, and any related cash flow implications.    e.	Provide recommendations for commercial service contract terms and conditions (e.g., IDIQ versus firm and/or optional requirements, termination for cause and convenience provisions, liability, insurance, warranties and intellectual property rights).  5.  Background  The historical documents listed below reflect NASA activities to date that are related to a wide variety of Space Transportation Services.  The documents are listed and attached for reference purposes only and they may be used to obtain additional information on COTS Phase 1, ISS cargo requirements, and NASA commercial launch services.   1.	COTS Phase 1 Announcement  2.	COTS Phase 1 Space Act Agreements  3.	ISS Cargo characteristics  4.	NASA Launch Services Request for Proposal, Rev.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four DME MACs under contract to CMS.     The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME PSCs).     These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function.

The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare.

The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to     1. coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); 2. provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; 3. provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; 4. develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs; and, 5. establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations.

The successful offeror must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS.     There are no exceptions to this requirement; offers which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.

In addition, the successful offeror:

- must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days);

- must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame;

- will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier;

- must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors;

- must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and

- must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes.

CMS intends to issue a solicitation for a competitive procurement for the PDAC Contractor - Medicare Administrative Contractor (PDAC MAC). It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<DESC>GSA Great Lakes Region 5 anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of a telecommunications local service contract for the six states within Region 5 area to include Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

Existing Program and Anticipated Replacement

The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Information Technology Services (ITS) Network Services Division (NSD) of the General Services Administration (GSA) currently provides local telecommunications services in the Region 5 area under multiple Metropolitan Area Acquisitions (MAA) contracts and a Regional Local Services Contract (RLSC).  

The current MAA and RLSC contracts offer a broad portfolio of commercial services and products at very competitive prices- including voice, data, video, internet access, broadcast news service, customer premises equipment (CPE), and technical services.  This requirement is to establish a method to replace the local dial tone services provided under the Region 5 Metropolitan Area Acquisition (MAA) contracts for Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Minneapolis and also to replace the Region 5 Regional Local Services Contract (RLSC), all of which are scheduled to expire in 2008 and 2009. MAA?s for Chicago and Cincinnati have been competed separately because of their contract expiration dates but provisions will also be in place to add these cities at either the end of their contract base years or an option year if it is in the best interests of the Government.

Acquisition Strategy

The Government has defined two service groups: voice services and data services, with related technical support and ancillary service enabling devices.  The Government?s approach to the acquisition of these services is as follows:

Voice Services (VS) ? Offerors shall propose voice services to be eligible for a RTAS award.  Voice services are specified in a functional manner in order to allow Offerors the flexibility to meet voice requirement with either traditional or emerging technologies.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the Associated Fund Administrators Botswana (PTY) Ltd, Gaborne, Botswana. 

Associated Fund Administrators (AFA) was incorporated in 1990 to administer the Botswana Public Officers Medical AIDS Scheme (BPOMAS) and PULA Medical AIDS Fund.  The BPOMAS and PULA make up approximately 73% of private medical aid scheme reflecting a nationwide coverage. The AFA administered scheme has 4,200 persons on antiretroviral therapy thus, having the second largest HIV/AIDS disease management program in the country after the government's MASA program. AFA is the largest medical insurance administrator in Botswana and the only one with national coverage which reaches most of the private practitioners. This capacity has not been seen with any other organization and AFA is the only organization with an existing link with the KITSO training program able to offer nationwide training according to national guidelines.  

The purpose of this contract is to do the following:  
(1)  provide four Continuous Medical Education (CME) training sessions utilizing KITSO courses to a total of 200 doctors and pharmacists; (2) finalize the training of staff on the development of informational tools; (3) finalize the development of program specific leaflets, and; (4) train staff in managed care outcomes and monitoring concepts.  

It is imperative to utilize Associated Fund Administrators (AFA) for this contract.  AFA is the only known source with the capacity and expertise to provide these services in the country of Botswana. Selecting a different contractor will require significant training and capacity building, which would be cost prohibitive and significantly delay the delivery of the services.

The North American Industry Classification Code is 611430.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The CDC/NIOSH/NPPTL has a requirement to build a firefighter?s heat sensing instrument and conduct a program of data collection using several heat sensing instruments. The provider of this data must possess a compact instrumentation system that accurately characterizes firefighter thermal loading without adding encumbrance to the fully equipped firefighter.  The design and efficacy of the instrumentation package is essential to the successful completion of this data collection project.  The appropriate thermal data collection device must rely solely on thermocouple input.  With appropriate tools analyzing these temperature data, a methodology should be used to derive information on the thermal exposure of firefighters and on the recommended limits of such exposure.  The proposed methodology should be supported by a significant validation database collected independently from this effort.  The data gathering strategy and the computational elements of the device should be developed independently from this effort.  Only the design modification, construction and testing of the specific devices used in this project will be included within this scope of work. 
The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland Fire Protection Engineering Department since the instrumentation needed to facilitate the temperature data collection project has already been conceived and designed by the staff.  NIOSH is unaware of any other qualified contractors available for this specific approach which involves a cooperative effort to collect the data required for these programs and to further develop the proprietary equipment that may lead to functional thermal warning devices.

No solicitation is available; however interested parties may request a copy of the scope of work. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of Maryland Fire Protection Engineering Department as the only contractor who currently has developed the concept for the unique instrumentation and data analysis algorithm. 


The time period for this project is September 1, 2007 through January 30, 2008. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Purchasing Agent within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please submit capabilities and supporting information to: James J. Ambrozic, REFERENCE: 0000HCCL-2007-46015, CDC/PGO/AAFB, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, v 412/386-6690, fax 412/386-6843 or e-mail eud7@cdc.gov. The Government will review any/all information submitted and determine if other qualified sources that could perform the effort. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, per FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be on a sole source basis conducted with the University of Maryland Fire Protection Engineering Department as the only source meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Supplies for DNA Sequencing Core (Seq. Buffer cat#4337457, POP-7 cat# 4363929, TAQ Gold cat# 4311818, 3730 Buffer cat# 4335613


Purpose/Brief History:

DNA sequencing is a core function of genome science.  Investigation of DNA sequences is the backbone of the Genetic Branch's research.  The current prevailing technology used in automated cycle sequencing is to generate a ladder of flurochrome tagged molecules from the sequence of interest.  This ladder is then fractionated by capillary electrophoresis and detected by laser excitation using a highly sensitive real-time imaging capture system.

These reagent kit are specifically designed to work with the GB's government owend Applied BioSystems Inc (ABI) fluorescent DNA sequencing machine.  It consists of an amplification and labeling formulation utilizing a proprietary energy transfer dye system which is unique in both its sensitivity and accuracy. Using reagents not developed by ABI may seriously jeopardize results. The GB has been using this reagent kit successfully for several years and to change kits now would introduce new variables into ongoing research projects. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Applied Biosystems is the sole source provider of these sequencing supplies, which are going to be used in the GB's government owned ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. Using reagents not developed by ABI may seriously jeopardize GB's results. The GB has been using these reagent kits successfully for several years and must continue to use the same kits throughout its research projects.

Washington, DC


The United States Government currently occupies 12,757 BOMA rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Washington, DC, that expires on January 23, 2010. The Government has a requirement for an additional approximately 41,528 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

?	South on Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

? Proximity to Metrorail
? Parking (reserved inside spaces for official Government vehicles)
? Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)
? Others

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government?s entire requirement for a five year term, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Please submit your responses via email only, no  later than August 22, 2007 12pm est. to Courtney-Lynn Barnes,  Courtney.Barnes2@pica.army.mil.

<ARCHDATE>11202007
<CONTACT>Ken Helms, (757)878-5909
<DESC>This is a synopsis for a noncommercial program entitled Visor Projection Based Helmet Mounted Display Flight Test.  The objective of this program is to integrate a non-developmental Helicopter Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) with visor projection into  an AH-64 Apache, and other U.S. Army Helicopter and evaluate its performance during flight-testing.  The system shall be capable of accepting, interpreting and projecting symbology, targeting, and night vision video imaging onto the visor.  The visor will  be see-through at a percentage acceptable to operate the helicopter while looking through, and offer sunlight reduction during day flight time.  The system will have integrated night vision that will be displayed using the visor projection display during night or dark flight time.  The contractor shall be required to provide incidental engineering and technical support to integrate the HMD system into the AH-64 aircraft and interface it to required aircraft systems (sensors, databus, power, etc).  The HMD system shall operate on 28 VDC aircraft power.  The integrated system will be used for testing and evaluation on an AH-64 Apache, and other Army Helicopter selected by the government to assess the viability of utilizing a visor projection HMD to allow cont inuous eyes-out flight and targeting in day and night conditions in an effort to increase the safety, and situational awareness of the aircraft pilots.  A sole-source award per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no oth er supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements of a Helmet Mounted Display using Visor Projection of all display information.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) IDIQ contract will be awarded to Thales Avionics Inc., who is deemed to be the only respon sible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  This acquisition will be conducted pursuant to the terms of FAR Parts 6 and 15.  Market research has identified only Thales Avionics Inc. as having a flight worthy Visor Projection HMD for Helicop ters.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Thales Avionics Inc.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Thales Avionics Inc., consistent with alpha cont racting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  The Thales HMD system is known by its trade name, TopOwl.  The TopOwl system is currently under production for applications in other helicopters, including the U.S. Marine Co rps (USMC) AH-1Z, and UH-1Y helicopters.  TopOwl is a Helmet Mounted Sight and Display system with integrated intensified night vision on the helmet, generation and display of flight symbology, navigation, weapons control and targeting, and sensor video on to the helmet visor.   The system has a fully overlapping 40º field of view, battery back-up in case of power loss, and a helmet tracking system.  Each helmet is personalized to give a precise fit to the pilot.  Thales is the original designer and develope r of TopOwl, and is deemed the only firm holding the technical data and having a mature visor-projection helicopter HMD without substantially duplicating cost and schedule.  The ordering period for this IDIQ is sixty (60) months.  The North American Indust ry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA- C (Ken Helms), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Mr. Helms phone number is 757-878-5909.

Population Status and Trend Monitoring
in the Methow Basin. Background Information on Methow basin steelhead project:

PIT Antenna Arrays

WDFW will construct and install PIT tag antenna arrays in the lower Twisp and Methow rivers.  The PIT tag antenna arrays will provide information regarding the distribution and run timing of wild and hatchery steelhead (for both adults and juveniles).  WDFW may also initiate PIT tagging adult steelhead at Wells Dam as part of the stock assessment activities that are currently ongoing.  

In addition, WDFW will purchase PIT tags for tagging steelhead parr encountered during residual steelhead surveys.  PIT tagging juvenile fish in the Methow River has been ongoing since 2004 and adult PIT tagging was initiated at Priest Rapids Dam in 2006. Data collected on within basin migration patterns of juvenile steelhead will increase the understanding of summer and winter habitat use.  

Increased redd counting effort/test current methodology

Surveys will be conducted to obtain total steelhead redd counts in the Twisp River.  The entire Twisp River will be surveyed each week for comparison with results from the current expanded index estimates (funded by Douglas PUD).  Total redd counts in the Twisp River will also be used to assess spawn timing and distribution of hatchery and wild fish through a tagging program conducted at the Twisp river weir.

The total estimated adult returns are currently determined by expanding the number of redds found in the surveyed index areas to the total spawning area.  In addition, steelhead redd abundance in low order tributaries is estimated based on redd density of similar sized index streams.   Total redd counts obtained under this contract will provide an assessment of the accuracy of the methodology used in the Methow Basin.  

TASKS/SERVICES:  The contractor shall:

?	Construct and install PIT tag antenna arrays in the lower Twisp and Methow rivers.
?	Tag steelhead parr encountered during residual steelhead surveys.
?	Conduct total steelhead redd counts in the Twisp River.

The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA  intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Archipelago Marine Research LTD for test applicability of EM technology to collect the necessary data aboard vessels that are unable to carry human observers due to size, weight or safety limitations.



The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC) is the government agency responsible for monitoring and managing west coast fisheries.  Within the NOAA?s Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division (FRAMD) is responsible for monitoring groundfish fishing off the west coast.

This contract is in support of the current at-sea observer program administered by FRAM and specifically addresses monitoring of the groundfish fishery that is too small or unsafe to deploy observers on.  Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) may be an applicable monitoring tools for a certain portion of the fleet in lieu of human observers.

This statement of work describes an electronic monitoring project to be designed for and deployed on the commercial fixed gear vessels operating off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California.  The overall goal of this project is to collect at-sea data to aid in monitoring groundfish bycatch by west coast fisheries.  An Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) can support at-sea bycatch coverage on the west coast by collecting vessel information from digital closed circuit television (CCTV) imagery of fishing operations, data from global positioning systems (GPS), and data from other on-board sensors.  This data will be used to verify total catch and areas fished. 
Fixed Gear Groundfish fishery
The west coast commercial groundfish fleet includes fixed gear (bottom longline and fish pot) vessels that fish coastwide and vary in length from kayaks to over 50?.  This fleet incidentally takes overfished groundfish species as bycatch.  Monitoring the fleet for fish discarded at-sea is essential to provide an estimate of total mortality to fishery managers. 
Timeline
The term of this project will be conducted over approximately 18 months.

Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers.  Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified herein below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance.<BR><BR> Contact ClientServices@FedBid.com or call 1-877-9FEDBID to address any questions or comments<BR><BR>New equipment ONLY,remanufactured products<BR><BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission<BR><BR>FOB Destination CONUS (CONtinental U.S.)<BR><BR>No partial shipments unless otherwise specified<BR><BR>IF AN ALTERNATE PRODUCT IS FURNISHED UNDER A CONTRACT OR ORDER FOR AN EXACT PRODUCT, THE ALTERNATE PRODUCT WILL BE AN UNAUTHORIZED SUBSTITUTION, AND MAY YIELD CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN ADDITION TO ANY CIVIL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT.<BR><BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.  Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justificaiton and Approval (J&A) on a brand name description is essentail to the Governmen’t requirements for Department of State infrastructure interoperability and connectivity with mission critical communications systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Network Appliance products as a key component of the Deparment’s core Microsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure on OpenNet.  The equipment listed above is required to support continuing operations of the Departmen’ts Enterprise E-Mail systems.  The curent Network Appliance systems provide storage for over 14,000 user mailboxes.  This acquisiton will allow MSO to support the Department’s IRM Bureau consolidation efforts and provide storage for 25,000 users on OpenNet.  This will also enable MSO to provide increased storage space for users – 500 MB mailboxes vs current mailbox size for users which is restricted to 100 MB.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO have committed to shared platform at a common alternate site for disaster recovery capability based upon Network Appliance technology. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core Micrsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure.  Network Appliance provided hardware, software, and services provide support for current E-Mail Central Site operations.  Network Appliance systems are tightly integrated with Microsoft Exchange and integrate semealessly into the Department’s networking infrastructre.  Therefore, Network Appliance has a thorough understanding of Microsoft Exchange and the Department’s operational requirements.  No other supplier possesses this level of capability and understanding.  Acquistion of storage systems from any other supplieir would involve substantial risk in the areas of quality and continuity of operations, cost for maintaining current operations, and schedule for deployment of Central Site consolidation capabilities.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO will be able to exploit a common platform based upon Network Appliance architecture and systems for  disaster recovery.  Economies of scale gained through the use of this common, shared platform for disaster recovery will result in savings of $1M to $3M for the Department.<BR><BR>

The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. You may, however,  download and print the file from the web site. 3. There is no fee for this solicitation. 4. A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and  F.W. Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. 5. A registration page will be attached to the web site. You are not  required to register. However, when you register, you will receive notice  of any amendments and/or addenda that may be issued to the solicitation.

<DESC>RFI Number:  	HSSS01-07-R-0035
Original Posted 
date:			19 July 2007
Response due date:  	30 September 2007

The following questions and answers are provided to each vendor.  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services. 



1. Is this opportunity going to be procured under DHS EAGLE? 

A: The USSS has not determined if this requirement will be procured under DHS Eagle, because this is a request for information (RFI) and not a solicitation for proposal, nor does it constitute a current or future government requirement. Please feel free to provide any information showing your company capabilities to meet this requirement. 
2. What information is available on the current databases that everything is coming from? 
A: The USSS is requesting your company to provide the database.
3. Is there an expectation that we will take input from existing databases or become the primary repository?
A: The USSS is requesting your company to provide the database.
4. Any information on current database technology usage: e.g., is it Oracle, SQL Server, etc.?
A: Either Oracle or Sequel Server could be utilized. 
5. What web architectures: UNIX/LINUX, Windows, etc.?
A: A windows based web architecture should be utilized.
6. What are the primary security and access issues that are known?
A: The USSS is requesting access to commercially available information that your company would provide.  
7. Any possibility of getting sample data upfront for development and testing?
A: The USSS is requesting your company to provide the data.
8. Assume the due date for the RFI response is 30 September 2007?
A: Yes. 
9. Is the government willing to entertain a demonstration of a capability that we believe fits this problem?
A: The USSS would encourage your company to provide a sample of your product via pamphlet, screen shots or other means.  Any material your Company provides will not be returned. After the USSS reviews this information your Company may be contacted for a demonstration or further discussion. 
10. I was hoping to get some background information on this study. Does the agency currently have a database that it is hoping to replace or is this a new effort? 

A: The USSS currently has contracts with several commercial database companies that provide a variety of resources.  The USSS has issued this RFI with the hope of identifying new and innovative products that contain the latest and most accurate commercially available information from a larger resource pool.  
 
11. Is there a preference for possible vendors to work at their facilities or in Government facilities?

A: The USSS would require vendors work at their own facilities. 

12. Which Agency office would be responsible for database deliverables? Any clarification you can offer is greatly appreciated.
A: The USSS is requesting your Company to provide the database deliverables.
13. We are trying to determine whether this RFI is to provide the Secret Service with access to the actual data listed or for database software to store, search and retrieve this type of data.
A: The USSS is requesting your company to provide the database.
14. Will Capability Maturity Model Integration Certification be required?

A: Certification requirements have not yet been determined. 

15. Where do we find the specific questions you would like answered in this RFI?
A: The USSS would encourage your Company to provide a sample of your product via pamphlet, screen shots or other means.  Any material you provide will not be returned.  The USSS would like your Company to use this opportunity to demonstrate your products.  Upon receipt and review of information received.  The USSS may contact your Company for further discussion or demonstration. 
16. Are the responses to be submitted in a particular format or length?
A: Your Company?s responses should be provided as you deem appropriate.  The USSS is attempting to locate new and innovative commercial database providers.  The USSS would encourage your company to provide a sample of your product via pamphlet, screen shots or other means.  Any material you provide will not be returned. 
17. Does Commercial Database for USSS refers to acquisition of COTS system to manages the types of data referenced or whether it is to procure the data itself (from services such as Choicepoint, Acxiom, infoUSA, Equifax, Dun & Bradstreet)?

A: Your Company would determine where your source of information originated.  Your company would organize and compile the data and provide a clear and complete report based upon the searchable information provided ie: telephone number, name, address, etc.

<DESC>This is an update to the notices N00019-06-P7-ZD180 and N00019-06-R-0052, posted on 24 March 20006 and 28 June 2006, respectively.  The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Program is being transitioned to the Navy Unmanned Combat Air Systems (N-UCAS) Program.  The N-UCAS Advanced Development Program Office (ADPO) has a requirement to develop and demonstrate technologies and operational concepts that will provide effective, affordable, survivable, and supportable Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) systems.  In support of this requirement, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to hold a limited competition to develop, build and test an aircraft carrier (CV) based Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) Demonstration System.  Participants will be limited to the current J-UCAS sources, which are: The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company (Boeing); and the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop).  Boeing and Northrop are the only known responsible sources with the required technical expertise to satisfy the Government?s requirements.  Award to any source other than current J-UCAS participants would result in substantial duplication of costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition.  The Demonstration System effort will be structured to mature critical technologies and reduce risk for aircraft carrier integration of an operationally relevant UCAS with a Low Observable (LO) planform.  The UCAS demonstration shall include, but is not limited to, Carrier Control Approach (CCA) operations, launch and recovery, deck operations and supportability.  Activities will focus towards a suitability demonstration of a relevant LO planform aboard ship no later than 2013.  The UCAS demonstration system will include an Air Vehicle (AV) and Mission Control System (MCS) design approach.  All correspondence and Request for Proposal will be posted to the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil (select Doing Business and then select Open Solicitations).  To date, no other company has expressed an interest in the Navy UCAS requirement.  A formal Request For Proposal (RFP) is planned to be released in late November 2006.  All questions and correspondence regarding this synopsis shall be sent to the Contracting Officer.  See Note 22.

Original Synopsis (7/9/07):  Mangrove Clearing at Various Locations, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  The Contractor shall work together with the Government to clear mangrove at various locations, Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii by means of a firm fixed-price contract.  Work shall be performed in accordance with acceptable horticultural practices and industry standards and methods.

The Government will grind, haul and dispose of the green waste generated by the mangrove clearing work.  The Government will also haul and dispose of refuse exposed by the clearing work.  The Contractor shall:  1) Cut mangrove on firm ground down to existing ground level without disturbing the ground.  Cut mangrove in water down to a uniform height between mean lower low water (MLLW), based on tidal datum on local tide table, and six inches above MLLW.  Cut mangrove without pulling of the roots and disturbing the sediments.  Minimize disturbance and generation of sediment turbidity.  The Contractor may clear trees and vegetation other than mangrove if it is more efficient and cost effective to do so in order to clear the mangrove; 2) Remove and segregate green waste generated by and refuse exposed by the clearing work immediately after the cutting work and load onto Government trailer truck or stockpile in area adjacent to and in close proximity of the respective project area as and where designated by the Government; 3) Furnish a tub grinder with operator for grinding of the green waste generated by the mangrove clearing work.  Mobilize the tub grinder to the various clearing sites to facilitate the grinding work at the respective site; 4) Not discharge any material into navigable water (e.g., harbor, streams).  All debris generated by the clearing work shall be contained within the project areas and shall be removed immediately; 5) Do all stockpiling on shore s in a manner that does not cause material to runoff into navigable water (e.g., harbor, streams); 6) Use mechanized equipment (if used) from the shore.  The equipment may not enter navigable waters (e.g., harbor, streams).  The equipment may tread over the uncut mangroves for greater reach as long as the cut mangrove and debris are removed immediately thereafter.  Workers may walk onto the mudflats or tidal areas to cut mangroves by hand or with chainsaws.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561730 and the annual size standard is $6,500,000.  The contract term will be approximately six months.  This is a new procurement.  It does not replace an existing contract.  No information exists on prior contracts.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/ when it becomes available.  All interested offerors shall register at the website.    No notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors.  The proposed contract listed here is 100 percent HUBZone set-aside.  The Government will only accept offers from certified HUBZone business concerns.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposal receipt date is approximate.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the response date for submittal of responses to this sources sought notice from 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 10 Aug 2007 to 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 20 Aug 2007.

COMNAVAIRSYSCOM is seeking information from potential suppliers regarding the H-46E torque indicating system.  The torque indicating system provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot.  The system consists of six torque sensors, two temperature compensators, two signal conditioners and two torquemeter indicators.  Inaccuracies in the existing torque indicating system have resulted in unnecessary maintenance and parts replacement.  Also, support equipment required to maintain the torque indicating system has become obsolete and is no longer procurable.  The new torque indicating system will incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that resembles the existing torquemeter indicator.  Minimal new support equipment will be required and the requirement for existing torque test sets will be eliminated.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This sources sought synopsis is seeking information from sources that are capable of manufacturing torque indicating systems.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis should be in the form of a technical approach that outlines processes needed to ensure that all aspects of a torque indicating systems engineering methodology are used in the execution of the program.  At a minimum, (1) the new torque indicating system will be compatible and integrated with existing H-46E equipment; (2) meet or exceed accuracy of the H-46E onboard aircraft integrated maintenance system (AIMS); (3) resemble the current H-46E torquemeter indicator; (4) provide torque signal validity; (5) require minimal peculiar support equipment for maintenance; (6) have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) combine functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes existing location on both the pilot and copilot consoles.  Due to the urgency of the need and the need for the torque instrumentation to interface with other on board systems, the Contractor shall possess recent H-46E engine instrument development experience for this effort.  It is requested that all interested parties submit a capability statement/documentation (under 25 pages) specifically addressing the technical approach to be taken to satisfy their statement of work tasking, potential teaming arrangements, related past performance, general corporate information, and their business size.  TELEPHONE REPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING (i.e. fax, email, or letterhead).  All responses will be kept confidential and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any proposal preparation costs associated with responding to this synopsis.  Proprietary Data in the responses will be protected where so designed.  All responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 20 Aug 2007.  All responses must be submitted to the Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Julie Paul, Code: AIR-2.4.3.3.2., Bldg. # 2272, Suite 353, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Email address:  Julie.Paul@navy.mil; Telephone Number (301) 757-6570; FAX (301) 757-9039.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Columbia Environmental Research Center, has a requirement to conduct research on the food habits of the San Marcos salamander and evaluate its associations with submerged aquatic.  This will require differentiating native floral species (e.g. Texas wild-rice; Zizania texana) from invasive species.  The outcome of this study will be used to adjust diet and the use of specific vegetation types for cover, reproduction, and feeding.  Work includes field collection of diet-related samples, vegetation data, and water quality to follow a stratified random sampling design. Because of the specific geographic focus of this project, it is critical that local expertise be enlisted to conduct these field studies.  Also, problems associated with shipping this rare species preclude conducting research at other facilities.  Period of performance includes one 12 month base period and one option year.  Based on the above the U. S. Geological Survey considers this a sole source to Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this imagery may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer, USGS, P.O. Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado  80225 no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ) the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  No number notes apply.  Any questions please contact Teresa Henninger, Contracting Officer at (303) 236-9319 or email thinning@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Heath Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a twelve (12) month purchase order with the Legal Action Center (LAC) to provide training, technical assistance and information to current and potential grantees in the CSAT and CMHS criminal justice grant portfolios in order to improve their clinical interventions and to improve their overall effectiveness with individuals with substance abuse and/or co-occurring disorders who are involved with the criminal justice system. SAMHSA has a lengthy history of supporting programming to assist individuals with substance abuse and/or mental health disorders who are involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems.  Through its Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), SAMHSA has funded hundreds of grants to provide substance abuse treatment infrastructure and services to substance using/abusing criminal defendants and/or offenders.  One of the paramount issues facing justice-involved populations is the numerous barriers these individuals encounter in seeking employment due to their criminal record.  SAMHSA is interested in assisting individuals with criminal records in accessing job training, employment and education. LAC will write a guide due in 180 days after award for SAMHSA/CSAT and its cohort of grantees dealing with treatment services for justice-involved clients.  This guide will provide information to strengthen the ability of treatment and recovery support services providers to assist their adult and juvenile clients with criminal histories in accessing job training, employment and education.  After dissemination of the guide, LAC will conduct a series of presentations and technical assistance at mandatory annual CSAT and CMHS grantee meetings.  These presentations will be either in person or via Internet Web casts. As required, LAC will provide additional technical assistance such as issue-specific briefs and toolkits. LAC will provide a summary report describing the successes and weaknesses of this initiative, any discernable outcomes related to grantee use of the materials, and recommendations to SAMHSA/CSAT on any next steps in dealing with this issue.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Heath Services know of no other potential organizations that possess the skills and resources to perform the tasks within budget (less than $100,000) and the required timeframe. The Legal Action Center is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks of this purchase order for the following reasons: The Legal Action Center (LAC) provides technical assistance to criminal justice agencies, workforce development programs, and policymakers on federal, state, and local legal barriers faced by people with criminal records in order to facilitate their successful re-entry into society and reduce crime and recidivism. The LAC conducts a wide range of programs to protect and advance the rights of people in recovery or still suffering from alcohol and drug problems, people at risk for or living with HIV/AIDS, and individuals with criminal justice histories, and to promote sound public policies in these areas. The most common subjects on which LAC services are sought include: 1) Alcohol and Drugs 2) HIV/AIDS and 3) Criminal Justice. LAC helps improve the criminal justice system by aiding qualified people with criminal records obtain employment and services needed to re-enter society successfully, assisting programs that work with them, and conducting public policy advocacy and research to reform sentencing laws, expand community corrections, and promote other sound policies. LAC's National HIRE Network operates a national clearinghouse of information and technical assistance for non-profit and government agencies working to improve the employment prospects of individuals with criminal records. The national clearinghouse serves as a central repository of information pertaining to the employment of individuals with criminal records for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers around the country. The clearinghouse includes information about model programs and policies, best practices, legal issues such as negligent hiring and employment discrimination, relevant research, and potential funding sources. This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 or via email at awebb@psc.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a twelve (12) month purchase order with the Legal Action Center (LAC) to provide technical assistance and information to stakeholders in the field of Substance Abuse Treatment through the development and dissemination of a Resource Kit designed to assist States, localities, and treatment organizations incorporate Recovery Support Services (RSS) into their delivery systems by addressing key issues related to regulation, oversight, financing, and quality assurance.  Specifically, the Kit will build upon the efforts initiated by SAMHSA on recovery support services as articulated in a report conducted by the Legal Action Center, ?Recovery Support Services Oversight and Diversification:  Existing and Emerging Practices?.  This document is considered by SAMHSA to contain the state of the art knowledge base related to RSS implementation. In support of its vision of ?a life in the community for everyone,? SAMHSA has focused significant attention on helping administrators and provider organizations in the addictions field shift their focus toward recovery-oriented systems of care (ROSC).  In December 2006, SAMHSA convened a stakeholder meeting to explore the role of recovery support services in a recovery?oriented system of care.  Within SAMHSA?s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), a number of initiatives supporting ROSC have been undertaken, including the Recovery Community Services Program (RCSP), Access to Recovery (ATR), and the 2005 CSAT National Summit on Recovery (?Recovery Summit?).  Creating ROSC requires a transformation of the entire service system as it becomes more responsive to and increasingly driven by the needs of the people and families seeking services. To be effective, ROSC have to infuse the language, culture, and spirit of recovery throughout their continuum of services.  To help people sustain recovery for the long haul, episodes of acute treatment often need to be augmented by recovery support services (RSS).  These RSS can be provided prior to treatment (?recovery priming?), during treatment, after treatment, or as an alternative to formal treatment.  RSS are often delivered in community-based settings by nontraditional providers, such as faith-based personnel and peers in recovery. The purpose of this purchase order is to collect and analyze existing resources and RSS materials, and compile these resources into a user-friendly resource kit.  The RSS Resource Kit will be reviewed by stakeholders in the field, and ultimately made available by SAMHSA in both hard copy and electronic formats. Additionally, LAC will compile existing resources and materials that can be used by a range of audiences to include: state, county, city and other government entities, provider networks, community organizations.  The resource inventory is designed to be used in the implementation and in oversight and quality improvement of RSS. LAC will design a user-friendly resource kit that provides informational resources for the development, delivery, and oversight of RSS. The Resource Guide shall not exceed 100 pages and should be designed to be disseminated in hard-copy and on-line. LAC will gather and analyze various documents, websites, and other materials on RSS.  Based on materials gathered, LAC will prepare a useful resource kit that includes user-friendly information on important issues in the implementation of RSS at various systems levels.  Examples of previously developed materials that should be reviewed include, but are not limited to: 1)SAMHSA?s White Paper on Recovery Support Services; 2) Materials from SAMHSA?s Recovery Community Services Program; 3)Materials from SAMHSA/CSAT?s Partners for Recovery regional meetings on recovery; and 4)Materials from the CSAT National Summit on Recovery. The Legal Action Center is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks of this purchase order, and the Government is aware of no other potential organizations that possess the skills and resources to perform the tasks that are required for the following reasons: This requirement is an extension of the work conducted by LAC in an earlier initiative resulting in a report to SAMHSA about the regulation of RSS in states. This report required an extensive amount of time and effort devoted to assessing the state of RSS implementation in selected states and analyzing information collected. This involved building relationships with many stakeholders on related issues in order to compile needed information. SAMHSA is now interested in taking the findings from this report and bringing them to scale nationwide via the development of a resource kit. LAC?s knowledge and skill base developed in their work on this initial seminal report will allow for a cost-efficient approach to the proposed scope of work since no time or resources will be required to become familiar with the research previously conducted in preparing the initial report to SAMHSA. In summary, there is no other entity that has the background that LAC has acquired through their ongoing activities, as well as through the report previously prepared for SAMHSA on oversight of recovery support services. This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 or via email at awebb@psc.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<RESPDATE>090607
<CONTACT>Dennis Scanlon, (202) 267-9422
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking competitive proposals from qualified companies to fulfill a requirement related to the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).  The following is a brief summary of the requirement.  Potential Offerors should not rely on this summary, when deciding whether to submit a proposal. The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, TCAS II Version 7, known internationally as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS II), was released in 1998 and incorporated significant operational and technical improvements over the previous version (6.04A).  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandated ACAS II equipage in ANNEX 6, Part I, chapter 6.18 by January 1, 2003, for certain operators internationally.  This mandate elevated ACAS II as the worldwide collision avoidance standard.   Subsequent to the release of TCAS II/ACAS II, the FAA and other ICAO states established monitoring programs to measure ACAS performance operationally in the airspace.   Several issues have been identified via these monitoring programs and simulations that warrant a detailed review and analysis of the collision avoidance system.  Some of the issues have been identified and discussed within the international collision avoidance community (ICAO Surveillance and Conflict Resolution Systems Panel).   Some ICAO member states have proposed a change to the TCAS II Version 7 collision avoidance algorithms, known as SA01, which could improve coordination of collision avoidance maneuvers, thus increasing the level of safety provided by the TCAS/ACAS system.  Through further detailed analyses and collaboration, it has been determined that a change to the collision avoidance logic is required and an implementation effort is currently underway to resolve this issue. Additionally, recent technological developments in airborne surveillance technology, specifically Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), could also enhance the performance of TCAS/ACAS.  Civil and military operators have expressed interest in incorporating Hybrid Surveillance; however, civil standards require development to achieve the standardization and interoperability of Hybrid Surveillance Systems.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) under contract to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).           

The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME Program Safeguard Contractors [PSC]).     These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function.

The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare.

The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to     (1) coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); (2) provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders, including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; (3) provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; (4) develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs;     (5) establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations.

In order to be considered for this requirement, an offeror:

a. must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS.     There are no exceptions to this requirement; offerors which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration. 

b. must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days);

c. must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame;

d. will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier;

e. must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors;

f. must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and 

g. must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes.


Business Information:     Please provide the following in your response:

a.       DUNS # 
b.       Company Name 
c.       Company Address
d.       Current GSA Schedules, if applicable, appropriate to this Sources Sought
e.       Do you have a Government approved accounting system?     If so, please                                                                                                                                                                                     
identify the agency that approved the system.
f.       Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran                                            owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).                                      All offerors must register on the CCR located at                                                           
                            http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.     
g.       Company point of contact, phone, and e-mail address 
h.       Point of contact, phone, and e-mail address of individuals who can verify       
the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.


Responses must be submitted no later than August 22, 2007.     They should clearly reflect the respondent's ability to meet the requirements included in this notice.     Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.     Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of their submissions.     Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential small business set-aside. The maximum number of pages for submission is 10.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal (RFP), or other solicitation and in no way obligates CMS to award a contract.     The sole intent is to obtain capabilities for set-aside and procurement planning purposes.       


CMS intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the PDAC MAC. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 4 option years. CMS anticipates the release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, which will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Office - Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO C4I ) PMW 160.2 Cryptographic Modernization Program Office (CMPO) is interested in modernizing the KWT/R-46 used aboard submarine platforms and associated shore sites so as to comply with NSA/CSS Policy 3-9 CM tenets and provide certain functionality already inherent in the legacy KWT/R-46.  The KWT/R-46 is a legacy teletype encryption device.  The KWT-46 provides link encryption, while the KWR- 46 provides link decryption.  The modernized KWT/R-46 (encryption/decryption device) will be utilized on submarines and shore sites. The KWT/R-46 operates over High Frequency (HF), Low Frequency (LF), and Very Low Frequency (VLF) broadcast from the shore to the submarine.  PMW 160 is investigating the feasibility of modifying an existing or near-term Cryptographic Modernization (CM) compliant cryptographic product to meet KW-46 CM requirements.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Inverter and Energy Management System Funding Opportunity Announcement Schedule Change
<DESC>THE U.S. DOE Solar Program is announcing a schedule change in the release of the Advanced Inverter and Energy Management System Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). The original schedule called for a release of the Advanced Inverter FOA in the late July/early August timeframe. However, due to promising interim results that we have received from the Renewable Energy Grid Integration (REGI) Study, DOE have decided to reschedule the release of the FOA at this time. The REGI studies are a series of analyses commissioned by DOE to study specific issues involved in the area of grid integration of renewable energy. The specific studies are: * Advanced Grid Planning and Operation * Distributed PV Systems Design & Technology Requirements * Test & Demonstration Program  Definition * Customer & Utility/Wholesale Value Proposition * PV Market Penetration Scenarios We feel that the information obtained from the results of these studies will assist us in releasing a better, more focused Funding Opportunity Announcement, thereby increasing the quality of the responses. The revised scheduled FOA release date is October 2007. If you have questions regarding this schedule change of regarding the FOA in general , please contact Dan Ton at 202-586- 4618 or dan.ton@ee.doe.gov.

<SUBJECT>W -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The reprocurement will comprise of a base year and four-one year options.  

Description:  Redi-Plex/Quad Shell Unit of approximately 46 feet X 58 feet

Maintaining the incumbent prevents substantial non-recoverable duplication of cost (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)).  Additional costs would be incurred due to the teardown and removal of the existing trailers, in addition to the installation and modifications of the new trailers to meet operational configuration objectives.  It is not reasonable to expect to recover these costs through competition and it is not reasonable to pay for requirements the Government has already paid (i.e. communication and security configuration modifications, delivery and set-up fees).  In addition, maintaining the incumbent precludes unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B)).  It is required that this procurement involves no disruption in continuity or cohesion.  Interested parties would have to furnish facilities on MacDill AFB during the installation, conversion and reconfiguration of the new trailers.  These facilities would have to be fully capable of meeting operational objectives.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332311.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 3448.

<SUBJECT>A -- Automated Aerial Refueling (AAR) Phase II Integrator Industry Day
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Vehicles Directorate, will be hosting an Industry day on 15 -16 Aug 07 at Crowne Plaza Dayton, OH.  The purpose of this industry day is to discuss the AAR Phase II program and address the technical role of AAR Phase II Integrator.  A BAA is anticipated to be released on 5 Oct 07 for the AAR Phase II Integrator.  Information contained in the final BAA synopsis takes precedence over any information that is presented at Industry Day.  

The AAR Phase II program seeks to build upon the success of the AAR Phase I Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The goal of the program is to mature the Phase I ATD technology into a system for automated boom/receptacle refueling.  The AAR Phase II program will use a spiral approach to develop the system.  The first spiral will seek to mature the AAR architecture developed under Phase I which incorporates Internet Protocol (IP)-based communications and relative navigation using Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System(GPS).

<SUBJECT>D -- SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT - ENHANCEMENTS TO ONE FORM DESIGNER PLUS (OFDP) SOFTWARE
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract with Amgraf, Inc., a small business, on a sole source basis to satisfy user requests for enhanced OFDP functionality and training and support for the OFDP software.  Background - The Forms and Mail Management Branch (FMMB) of Administrative and Customer Services Division (ACSD) began their use of Amgraf, Inc. software in 1991 to design questionnaires.   When the IBEAM project was initiated, the goal was to pass questionnaire content to ACSD in a controlled format.  At that time, it was determined that the most efficient approach would be for Amgraf, Inc. to write the software, which would provide interface - the means of information transfer - between the Amgraf software and IBEAM.   The project to create the interface between One Form Designer Plus (OFDP, Amgraf software) and the IBEAM system was successfully completed.  Future Requirements - Since the initial phase of the extended project, Amgraf, Inc. has been successfully called upon to provide similar services for the past two years on this critical phase of the project, and the expertise of this proven team of experts remains needed through 2011. The continuing use of their expertise and past experience of Amgraf, Inc. on this project, will help ensure its success.

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing , and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Albert E. Kennedy at the U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division, via email address albert.ernest.kennedy@census.gov.  Ensure subject is titled ENHANCEMENTS TO ONE FORM DESIGNER PLUS (OFDP) SOFTWARE.

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to Amgraf, Inc. without further notice.

<SUBJECT>--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) -- Regarding Commercially Available Field/Portable Surgical Scrub Sinks
<DESC>Description:  The Army is seeking information regarding commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) ruggedized surgical scrub sinks.  The Army is researching information for a lightweight, portable, self-contained scrub sink that provides hot and col d running water under different types of power and water supply conditions.  The sink will be used in austere field environments, so it is essential that it be rugged, lightweight, transportable, and easy to use and maintain.  It should also have standardi zed connections, consume minimal power and water and be usable both in the presence and the absence of electricity and pressurized water sources.  The current field sink used by the Army is no longer procurable.  This item is necessary in the combat suppor t hospital and other field medical settings for scrubbing of hands in preparation for surgery and for cleaning of instruments and trays used in the operating room or elsewhere.  In addition to requesting written responses to this RFI, the Army also encoura ges manufacturers of scrub sinks that meet (or come close to meeting) the Armys requirements to display their products at the next military medical Vendor Day scheduled for 5 September 2007.  Vendor Day is a cooperative venture between the military serv ice medical logistics agencies located at Fort Detrick in Frederick, MD. The agencies involved include the Defense Medical Standardization Board (DMSB), U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA), the Naval Medical Logistics Command (NAVMEDLOGCOM), the Air  Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA), and the Air Force Medical Logistics Office (AFMLO).

<SUBJECT>--Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE) 07-1  Advanced Biological Agent Identification Technologies for the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) Identifier Upgrade Effort
<DESC>Refer to the original Federal Business Opportunities announcement for this effort, which was published on March 20, 2007. Phase I of the TRE was completed in May 2007 and organizations which were invited to participate in Phases II & III of the TRE w ere notified by letter. This announcement is issued to provide additional information concerning the remaining Phases of the TRE. This announcement is not seeking additional participants for the upcoming phases, and any responses received as a result of th is notice will not be considered. As communicated in the March 20, 2007 announcement, Phase II evaluates identifier technologies for use with the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS). The tests are designed to provide data for the assessment of identifier technologies which may offer performance superior to that of the current system identifier. The U.S. Army is under no obligation to select any of the participating technologies. TRE 07-1 is a separate and distinct effort which has no connection to any of the JBPDS programs ongoing contract actions. Phases II & III will conduct laboratory evaluations of the proposed technologies, and are scheduled to occur at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT beginning on or about 1 October 2007, for up to four wee ks in duration. All contractors selected in Phase I are encouraged to participate in the subsequent phases. Phase III will evaluate the technologies capability for automated identification of inactivated antigens in Formulated Tap Water. This testing will  be scored separately from the Phase II portion of the TRE and will commence after Phase II testing has completed. Phase II participants should also be aware that at the current time the Government has no other venue, other than the TRE, through which upgr ade identifier technology will be evaluated for future block upgrade to the JBPDS. All questions concerning the TRE should be submitted to the US Army Technology Readiness Evaluation Team, monica.kelley1@us.army.mil. Format is plain text.

Prohibition Of Discrimination Against Individuals With Disabilities.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 including Section 302, which provides that:

No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.

Background:  

Although drug use among America's youth has declined in recent years, far too many young people continue to use these harmful substances.  Results of the 2005 Monitoring the Future Survey show that in the 30 days prior to the survey, use of an illicit drug was reported by 8.5 percent of 8th graders, 17.3 percent of 10th graders and 23.1 percent of 12th graders.  Annual prevalence rates for these age groups  were 15.5 percent, 29.8 percent, and 38.4 percent respectively.

The consequences of drug use by this vulnerable population are clear.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, students using illegal drugs are more likely to have negative attitudes about school (2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health0 and to have engaged in the following delinquent behaviors during the past year:  gotten into a serious fight at school or work, attacked someone with the intent to inflict serious injury, carried a handgun, sold illegal drugs, or had stolen or tried to steal something worth $50 or more (2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health).

In addition, an analysis of data from the national Household Survey on Drug Abuse over a three year period (1994-1996) found that frequent marijuana users were more likely than less frequent users to report delinquent behaviors such as running away from home, stealing, and cutting classes or skipping school.  Clearly, drug abuse both interferes with a student's ability to learn and disrupts the orderly environment necessary for academic achievement.

Since 2003, ED, working in close collaboration with the Office of National Drug-Control Policy in the Executive Office of the President, has awarded grants to 87 school districts and other entities to support implementation of student drug testing in the nation's schools.  This program has been identified as a priority by the Administration and the President's budget request calls for significant increases in its funding in fiscal year 2008.  In light of this anticipated growth, ED and ONDCP need information about the implementation of these grants in order to assess the efficacy of the programs and respond to requests for information about drug testing.

The Office of Management and Budget has approved a 30-item questionnaire that will be sent to all grantees.  ED will mail the questionnaires to each of the grantees in July 2007, provide any follow-up that may be necessary to encourage grantees' voluntary participation in the survey, and collect all surveys that are returned by the grantees.  An 80 percent response rate is anticipated.

The contractor will receive the questionnaires from ED, enter the responses into an appropriate database, analyze the information, and prepare reports of the findings.  At the conclusion of the period of performance, the contractor shall deliver to ED the data base and all data on each of the grantees.  Data from these reports shall not be made public or used in any manner by the contractor without the express written consent of ED.

<DESC>The 96th Contracting Squadron, 96 CONS/MSCBB at Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a Firm-Fixed Price, Sole Source contract to Weidlinger Associates, Inc., for the services listed below.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The announcement number is F1T0CY7205A001. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, with a small business size standard of $6.5M. 


The Air Force requires computational support for its multi-hit program to help plan tests and verify test configurations for detonations of weapons embedded in bare or soil covered reinforced concrete slabs. An advanced nonlinear transient analysis, three dimensional Computational Structural Dynamics code is required for these computations. This code should have advanced constitutive models capable of modeling cratering, spall and damage in blast and penetration environments as well as multiple loading states for reinforced concrete, metals and soils. In addition, there is a need to perform parametric studies for different penetration scenarios and multiple sequential and simultaneous loading sequences to help determine the effects of key parameters on damage to buried bunkers and slabs. This data will be used to help understand both small and full scale test results, relate small scale tests to full scale tests and generate a data base that can be used for fast running tools in such codes as MEVA and IMEA.


Final inspection and acceptance will be at Eglin AFB, FL 32542.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. If your company is capable of providing this item, pricing and product literature must be received no later than 1:00 P.M., Central Standard Time on 10 August 2007. The quote is at the discretion of the offeror. Send all packages to 96 CONS/MSCB, Attn: A1C Thomas Harvey, 205 West D Ave. Suite 541 (Bldg 350), Eglin AFB, Florida 32542-6862, by phone (850) 882-0327, facsimile at (850) 882-1680, or email at thomas.harvey@eglin.af.mil.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following: 1)   17-4 PH Thrust Runners.  Qty 20 Thrust Runners should be permanently marked by stamping or etching on the edge.  Designation should be 17-4/1, through 17-4/20. 2)   Inconel 718 Thrust Runners.  Qty 20 Thrust Runners should be permanently marked by stamping or etching on the edge of the runner.  Designations should be Inc 718/1 through Inc 718/20. Foil Bearing and Thrust Runner Description Gas foil bearings utilize ambient air for hydrodynamic lubrication between surfaces in relative motion.  Two fundamentally different types of foil bearings exist for supporting rotating shafts.  Thrust and journal bearings are used to support load in the axial and radial directions respectively.  Thrust runners are the rotating disks used in foil thrust bearing research.  These disks are generally made from Inconel 718, a high strength nickel based superalloy used in many high temperature applications.  The runners are coated with different materials including electrolyzed chrome and PS304, a high temperature solid lubricant developed by NASA for use with foil bearings.   Thrust Runner Specifications Two drawings are included for thrust runner fabrication, one calling for Inconel 718 and another for 17-4 PH, a high strength stainless steel alloy.  Each of these materials is necessary for testing thrust bearings over a broad range of operating temperatures and speeds.   Thrust Runner OD:	4.000 inches Hub OD: 	1.688 inches Overall Length: 1.900 inches Undercut:	0.015 inches deep within specified diameters, undercut is excluded on half of the runners required for each material Materials:   -Inconel 718, heat treated to specifications on included drawing 	     -17-4 PH, heat treated to specifications on included drawing Delivery Time:	40 complete runners, 20 of each material are to be delivered within 6 weeks of the contract award. Thrust runners spin at speeds in excess of 80,000rpm at temperatures up to 1200°F, therefore geometric tolerances and heat treatments are important for manufacturer selection.  Required tolerances are as tight as .2mil of flatness and parallelism on a 1.688in diameter.  Runners will be coated, ground, and balanced at NASA Glenn prior to use.   The number of thrust runners to be made can be changed based upon the unit price quote provided from each manufacturer.  A minimum of 20 runners, 10 per material, is established as the least amount required for current thrust bearing research.	Request quotes for various sized orders from 20 to 100 runners.  More runners are desirable if a bulk order can keep cost low. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-18.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

Objectives for this BIM Solicitation:
?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services such as Fire, HVAC, Data/Communications, Security, and Lighting that may be utilized for building design, construction, and operation.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.
?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.
?	To create a 4D model to facilitate tenant phasing during construction.
?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in 1.1-1.3 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-7033. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 dated 06/30/2007. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase  custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray? Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT. Delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items;  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall have posted their FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items at website http://orca.bpn.gov.

Task Area 1 ? Hardware

Please provide a quotation for the hardware and licenses listed in Attachment 1. Please submit quote using the provided spreadsheet format.

Task Area 2 ? Hardware Integration

Please provide a quotation for the hardware prep work, installation, system configuration. Please include estimated travel expenses.  

Task Area 3 ? Oracle Database Conversion 

Please provide a quotation for the tasks listed below: email amcgee@cc.nih.gov for attachment

Initial database installation and setup
Engineers will install and configure DBMS software and database to provide for both uninterrupted 24x7 database service and top database performance. Particular database deployment depends on the client's hardware configuration, business needs and installed applications. Engineers will also create and configure standby or replicated databases for dual systems configurations, setup database backup, configure automatic database maintenance and performance gathering scripts and perform initial database performance tuning.

Database upgrades
From time to time, database management software and underlying database needs to be upgraded to resolve critical bugs or because previous DBMS version becomes de-supported (Expected lifetime of database software is currently 2 to 3 years). Database upgrade is often required as well when application code is upgraded to support new functionality. 
Engineers must have all the necessary knowledge to perform database upgrades for db_VISTA (RDM), ORACLE database engines and they will make sure that the database version transition goes fast and smooth.

Ongoing database maintenance
Create and prepare the database(s) for test or upgrade system, load or unload data to/from the database, initialize database in full or only certain areas (i.e. patient data only).

Database monitoring
Database monitoring can detect problems before they become critical, identify performance bottlenecks and warn about possible inconsistencies in the database, system or software. 

Problem determination and resolution
Databases may fail or experience errors due to a number of reasons, including power fluctuations, system crash, hardware failures, bug in a software or a user error. Problem determination and resolution, thus, requires the person to be the expert in a number of fields, including system administration and engineering, database administration and LIS software. 
Critical performance problems ("deadlocks", "lock ups", or "very slow system" events) can often be resolved "on the fly" to minimize client's downtime and adverse effects of slowdown.

Database backup, recovery and failover.
It is essential that patient data is protected and recoverable should the disaster strike. Engineers will create and set up backup configuration, adjusted to our hardware architecture and requirements. 
Database backups monitoring and verification is a cooperative effort between engineers and the client, DCRI will check their database backup daily and report any failures to engineers  to make sure database is continuously recoverable.
Although backups are normally performed as automatic or semi-automatic jobs, recovery is a complex process, which requires significant knowledge of database engine and is usually a manual process, performed by domain expert.
For dual systems configurations, database operations can be fail overed to the auxiliary system, if the primary system fails.
Database administrators are trained and certified in database backup and recovery and database failover.
Database performance tuning

Performance of applications depends to a large degree on a performance of the database. Properly configured and tuned database can increase database through output and reduce average wait times several times, compared to an untuned one on the same hardware. Engineers will collect and analyze database performance statistics over representative time period and perform necessary adjustments to database(s), based on the current workload, underlying system configuration and business needs. 
Conduct periodic workload analysis and adjustments are necessary to make sure database is running on peak efficiency.


Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Government Furnished Information:

The government will provide the contractor with the necessary facilities to support task completion, including desktop computers, software and network services.

IR1052-00-025 SHIPPING LABEL INSTRUCTIONS  

All contractors shall clearly mark the procurement award number(s) on the shipping label of each delivery of supplies, products, components, equipment or any other package to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. Department of Treasury Bureau or any other Government location under this award.  The unique IRS award number is the number that is of primary importance on the shipping labels in order for the IRS to track inventory.  The IRS designator could consist of the following: the IRS Contract Number, or Purchase Order Number, the IRS Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Number against a GSA contract, and the Delivery Order or Task Order Number against an IRS, GSA or other Government agency contract/BPA. If the product being delivered has multiple procurement award numbers, each of those numbers shall be clearly marked on the shipping label.  For example, an award under an IRS BPA should list the BPA number first, followed by the order number on the shipping label.  GSA contract or FSS numbers are only required on shipping labels when the order has no unique IRS award designator.; 

 IR1052-01-001 ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT) PAYMENTS  

Effective May 1, 2002, in order to receive payments under this contract/award, contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Beginning October 1, 2002, CCR will be the primary database used to obtain contractor information for all Federal Government contracts. Contractors can complete the on-line CCR registration process by accessing http://www.ccr.gov.  Annual renewal of a contractor's registration is a requirement.  There are mandatory fields in CCR that need to be completed before the registration can become active.  For example, contractor business, name, address, telephone, point of contact, business start date, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (plus 4 digits, if applicable), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) account numbers to permit receipt of electronic payments, are all mandatory fields.  Registration via the internet can generally be activated within 48 hours, if all the information is complete and accurate.  Registration via another method can take up to 30 days.

The CCR web site contains information and a telephone number (800-333-0505) where a contractor can call to get an expedited DUNS number, in order to start the registration process. Contractors must obtain the EFT account numbers from its own financial institution, if not already known.  Contractors will be ineligible for awards, if they are not registered in CCR, unless they meet an exception or apply for a waiver.  Contractors requesting a waiver from CCR registration must apply via the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to incorporate clarifications and responses to questions discussed as a result of the site visit held July 13, 2007.  

Question 1: If flooding or standing water prevent installation of trees, during the established period of performance, will the Government extend the period of performance to allow performance the following year?  

Response 1: We do not anticipate abnormal weather conditions preventing installation of seedlings on this property.  Interested parties are expected to take into consideration the site conditions of this wetland.  The government will evaluate offerors technical capability to purchase, deliver, coordinate storage, and install tree seedlings as specified.  If extreme abnormal conditions threaten the successful installation of tree seedlings, for example if the site is flooded for weeks at a time, the Government will offer relief on the delivery schedule.

Question 2: If extreme weather conditions cause flooding which prevent the installation of the tree seedlings, who will take responsibility for the unused tree seedlings?  

Response 2:  Offerors will submit documentation to support their proposed delivery schedule, technical capability to perform, and past performance documentation.  The documentation should include offerors proposed Delivery Schedule.  The Government will evaluate documentation received and process an award to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government.  The evaluation of the contractors technical capability will take into consideration the offerors proposed number of workers (crew size), number of trees per day per person expected to install (delivery schedule), contingency plan for making up days lost due to bad weather.  If after award the Government determines extreme weather conditions have prevented successful installation of tree seedlings, the Government will negotiate purchase of any unused tree seedlings.  This in effect will eliminate any risk to awardee for extreme weather conditions preventing installation of tree seedlings.  Awardee is responsible for notifying the Government of extreme weather conditions which prevent the successful installation of tree seedlings. 

Question 3:  What warrantees are required?

Response 3:  The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Guaranteed survival rate of seedlings after planting shall be specified in offerors quotation.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.     

Note: The occupation code under the Service Contract Act DOL wage determination for Atkinson County Georgia is as follows:  08340 ? Tree Planter ($8.94/hour plus benefits).  Reference 
Wage Determination No: 1974-1218 Revision 30, dated 5/29/2007.

Note: The Atkinson County Georgia Forestry Commission will allow refrigeration trucks to be stored in their parking lot to facilitate restoration of this property.    

Note: Response time is extended; responses are due by 12:00 PM local time, July 24, 2007 at USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, 355 East Hancock Avenue, Suite 202, Athens, Georgia 30601.

<DESC>Questions and Answers to FDA-SOL-07-00338 (Sterilizers)

1.	Specification stated requirements for Automatic Steam boiler Blowdown and secondary low water cutoff which are for steam generators. However, spec state house steam is available, no power is available for a boiler, and no clean steam is available either. Is a clean steam generator required? Will the power be available? 
A steam filter will be put in place to clean up the steam.  Power will be available for any need for the operation of the unit. 
2.	Specification states requirements for a vacuum pump. However no power is available for the pump. Please advise if the vacuum pump is required or if power will be made available for the pump?
The vacuum pump is needed to evaluate the steam and dry the contents of the autoclave to remove as much steam and water as we can. This will keep the vials from collecting water in and around the vials
3.	A Cross Contamination Barrier is requested but it looks like only a single door is required.  Cross Contamination Barriers are used with double door units.  Is this unit a single or double door?  
The unit requested is a single door.
4.	If it is a double door, which side should the Cross Contamination Barrier be on, the control side (load end) or the remote end (unload end)?  

Not applicable, we need a single door unit.  

5.	A boiler control and safety device (CSD-1) option is requested but the unit does not request an integral boiler.  This option is only used in conjunction with an integral boiler and you have house steam available it looks like.  Please verify.  

No, in checking with the on-site engineers, we do not need this device.  There was some confusion about this matter with the architects, but I think we have resolved the issue.  
 
6.	The Auto Blowdown option is also only used in conjunction with an integral boiler and you have house steam I believe. Please verify.  

We do have house steam and since we do not need the control/safety device, we also do not need this option.   

7.	Stainless Steel piping to the chamber is requested and typically a facility has clean steam available when stainless piping is used. Is this in fact the case or if you do not have clean steam?  I think you might want to consider using copper and brass piping to save money if clean steam is not available.  

Clean steam is not available in this facility, but we had anticipated installing a filter on the steam line to remove as much physical debris as possible before the steam enters the autoclave jacket to protect the unit.  Where possible, we would like to have stainless Steel, perhaps on the downstream side of the filter.  Above the filter, we could specify Copper and brass piping.  

8.	What is being sterilized that a vacuum pump is required?  The unit you specified comes with a water ejector to create a vacuum and run the vacuum cycles.  The addition of the vacuum pump option is only used to pull a deeper vacuum after the water ejector.  I do not think this is required and can save significant cost as well.  

We have to dry wrapped goods in the unit, and were under the impression that additional vacuum was necessary to dry these materials.  Because this was not specified in earlier purchases, a unit was purchased that did not have any vacuum cycles.  We wanted to be sure that we can dry wrapped goods in the unit; perhaps those are the key words we need in the request.

PROJECT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
1) Question-What sort of video input sources will you be using with the projectors(DVI, VGA, Composite, component)? We need specific information so the cables can be made accordingly. Please list all that apply. Answer-Composite AV is one source, the second one is VGA for the replacement projectors and composite AV for the new install with second input as component.

2) Question- Where is the video cabling being routed to? The distance of each cable run is important as well as if this it to be interior an existing wall or inside an exterior-wall conduit. Answer- The cables are each 45? to 50? average and are routed to/from PC and VCR within the room, typically at the front of the classroom. All cables are above ceiling tiles and or inside hollow walls. 

3) Question-How far away from the power source will these projectors be? It would be most cost effective if there is a uniform length you want the power cords to be made. Answer- Power source is next to each projector and standard length power cords are needed.

4) Question- What sort of surface will these be mounted to (joist beams, false panel ceiling, other)? Answer-False panel ceiling.

5)  Question- Is cabling required for 4 new installations?  Answer- Yes. 
5a) Question- If so what is average length of cable run. Answer- Cable runs will average 45? to 50?.

6)  Question-Does repositioning mean simply adjusting a mounted projector or moving projector and mount to other part of the room?  Answer- It could be either since not all projectors have the same distance throw to fill the 96?X74? screen, so you may have to do a minor zoom adjustment or maybe move the projector and mount forward or back in order to obtain the correct image size.

7)  Question- In the rooms that are not having new systems, will we use the existing cabling?  In other words will we use the existing cabling or do we pull out the old cabling and install new for all rooms? Answer- Hopefully yes that is the plan; 10 of the 14 classrooms if not all can reutilize the existing cabling.

8) Question-  CLIN 0003 requires 2 each long throw lens for the JAG School Court Room.  Just to clarify this room is only getting one projector but 2 long throw lens. Is this an error or correct?
Answer- The courtroom and the conference room need the long throw lens. 

9)  Question- CLIN 0005 requires new Chief or equal Unity mounts for the new projectors in all rooms.  Photo 0425 shows a pipe that is incompatible with the 1 1/2" needed for the required Chief mount and there is not enough detail in photo 0428 to clearly define the required pole and ceiling kit.  This will be one of those areas where a change order could occur unless addressed now.  Should we quote ceiling kits and mount poles for all required mounts? Answer- Four of the old projectors will need the 11/2? pipe, the others already have one. 

10)  Question- .  What is the exact throw (distance from the projector lens and the projector screen) for JAG School Conference Room (Room 103) and JAG School Court Room?.  Answer- JAG School Conference room throw distance is 23 feet and JAG School Court room is 33.5 feet.

11)  Question- What are the screen measurements in the JAG School Conference Room (Room 103) and JAG School Court Room? Answer- The screen in the Conference room is 96? x 72? and the screen in the Court Room is 84? X 78?. 

A building diagram showing projector locations and digital photographs of classrooms and existing projector setup are available.  If you would like copies, please email your request to frank.spencer@maxwell.af.mil.
