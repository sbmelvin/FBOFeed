<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness Directorate,
Warfighter Training Research Division, (AFRL/HEA) is issuing this DRAFT solicitation.  There will be a final solicitation issued in regard to this requirement at a date TBD.  A pre-solicitation conference will be conducted at 6030 S. Kent Street, Mesa AZ 85242 on 19 January 2005 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Offerors must report to Bldg 561 to be escorted to the actual pre-solicitation conference room.  The purpose of the pre-solicitation conference is to solicit industry comments and questions on this draft BAA.  Also at the pre-solicitation conference, the technical POC will conduct a tour of the facilities at AFRL/HEA, and he will conduct one-on-one discussions with potential offerors to promote understanding before the final BAA is released.  The one-on-one discussions will allow offerors to communicate potential improvements and unclear areas in the draft BAA, and to provide other suggestions. 

The dramatic transformation in America’s strategic environment demands an equally dramatic transformation in how we prepare the force.  The effects of the transformed strategic environment on the force are many.  The emphasis has shifted from deliberate planning to time-sensitive planning, from permanent organizations to expeditionary organizations, and from large hierarchical organizations to smaller forces capable of operating anywhere, anytime, day or night, and in all weather.  Training must, therefore, transform to support the needs of the force.  Training must prepare the force to learn, improvise, and adapt rather than to merely execute fixed doctrine to standards.  Training Transformation will focus on continuously improving defense readiness by providing dynamic capabilities-based training in support of national security requirements across the full spectrum of service, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations. The objective of the Warfighter Readiness Science and Technology Program is to research, develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and transition leading edge technologies and methods to improve warfighter readiness and optimize human-centered logistics processes, enabling the expeditionary aerospace force to achieve their mission goals.
Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) not to exceed $25,000 for Information Technology (IT) on site training as described below.  Proposals are being requested by January 21.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  <>  TPL Tables for Windows Introduction:  
This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need to understand the process of creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  TPL TABLES is a general-purpose cross-tabulation software package.  It is based on the BLS-developed mainframe TPL system. TPL TABLES has been commercially available since 1987.  It is used at government agencies, private companies, associations, and universities around the world.  TPL TABLES is used to summarize data and present the results in a tabular form.  Its tabulation engine is fast and efficient.  The output produced by TPL TABLES is considered publication-quality.  This course will teach the participants how to use the MS-DOS editor or the Windows editor to create the text files used in TPL TABLES jobs, how to write the data description file (codebook file) needed to create tables, how to design table request files that specify the structure of the table output, and how to write format request files to produce the publication ready table formats.  

  <>  TPL Tables for Windows Intermediate:  
This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need advanced knowledge for creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing, analyzing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  This course will briefly review the material taught in Introduction to TPL TABLES for the PC and cover more advanced topics, including generating statistics, sophisticated table design, and complete table formatting.  

  <>  TPL-SQL for ODBC:  
This is a two-day, hands-on course.  The TPL-SQL database interface gives you direct database access from TPL Tables.  It eliminates the need for you to first extract the data from the database before creating tables.  You do not need to know SQL commands, because TPL Tables automatically generates the required commands and extracts only the data it needs.  TPL-SQL works via ODBC to access databases for which you have ODBC drivers.  Some examples are SAS, Sybase, MS Access and SQL Server.  The TPL Codebook Builder makes use of the data descriptions stored in the database to help you build a TPL codebook (data description) interactively.  

The BLS has three training rooms in the Postal Square Building (PSB), each of which is equipped with Dell Pentium desktop computers for up to eighteen students.  Classes will have a minimum of 8 students and the training will be conducted on-site in the PSB.  The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.  The training is to provide participants with new capabilities to significantly improve the way complex systems are analyzed, designed, developed, and implemented.  Offerors must be able to document instructor qualifications and experience in presenting the training described in this announcement.  

Any questions concerning the training in this announcement must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 13.  Proposals complete with pricing must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 21.  U.S. Postal Service deliveries to the PSB may be delayed due to special processing requirements.  To ensure on-time arrival, all submissions should be transmitted by fax or by e mail to the contacts listed below.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.  All correspondence must reference this FedBizOpps solicitation number.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE:  This requirement is for the procurement of a qualified construction contractor to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Removal and Replacement of the Exterior Aluminum Curtain Wall, windows and entries of the John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building, Boston MA. The facility consists of a main lobby and connecting link, a high rise tower of twenty four stories with windows, two stair towers and curtain walls, two entries of one and two stories with curtain walls and a low rise building of four stories over a basement parking level. The building exterior façade is constructed of pre-cast concrete panels with operable windows.  The work includes but is not limited to the removal and replacement of all windows and curtain wall systems; and new entrances. The major portion of the work will be completed during off-hours to accommodate continued occupancy by the government during construction. This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is 64 weeks. 

The successful firm must have previous experience with construction projects of similar size and scope with particular emphasis in off hour renovations in occupied buildings.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: Window replacement of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $5 million dollars or more and/or window replacement projects in occupied high rise buildings of approximately $5 million dollars or more. In addition, the successful contractor will be required to provide engineering services for design with experience in Glass Retention, and to demonstrate compliance of the proposed curtain wall and window systems with the project requirements. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated project cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the “best value” to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.   

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance Window Replacement projects of similar size and complexity, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing window replacement projects in an occupied high rise building.
3 Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238150, Size standard is $12 million.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. Copies of this Solicitation (RFP), minus technical specifications and drawings will be available through the World Wide Web only on or about 6/30/04.,

<DESC>The systems to be purchased will be used by the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory to capture and print images of evidence under microscopic examination.  Their firearms division examines and documents bullets, cartridge cases, and a wide variety of toolmark evidence.  They use comparison microscopes to compare evidence collected at a crime scene to test fired ammunition and/or test impressions made by questioned tools in the lab.  The system will be used to visually document these comparisons.  The camera must mount and focus properly on the microscope used by the crime lab.  The imaging system components must be compatible with the Leica UFM 4 and/or Reichert comparison microscopes. These microscopes cost many times what this imaging system does and it all has to work together.

Line item 2 is for their Trace Evidence Division and will be used for similar purposes to document various types of trace evidence (e.g. hairs, fibers,glass and paint fragments, etc.).  It must be compatible with the Leica FS4000 comparison microscope.

F.	Maintain the control boxes in the Operation Center and Maintenance Control centers to ensure proper function.
G.	Update any software pertaining to the system as needed.
H.	Provide 24/7 maintenance of entire system.

4. Evaluation Factors
Contractor’s proposals will be judges for merit and BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT based on the following criteria:

4.a. Technical Factor:  This factor considers the degree to which the proposal demonstrates the ability to meet the solicitation’s technical requirements.  Information considered in this factor includes the proposed approach to the solicitation’s technical requirements: sample maintenance plans illustrating a grasp of the complexity of the work and quality of the solution.

4.b. Management Factor:  This factor considers the degree to which the proposed management and implementation approach provides effective organization, visibility and control of the contract and deliverables.  Information considered includes knowledge and ability to professionally, efficiently and safely manage all aspects of the maintenance agreement contract.

4.c. Relevant Experience and Past Performance:  This factor considers the degree of the contractor’s experience and past performance to the probability of successfully accomplishing all aspects of the contract.  Degree of experience considers the contractors relevant experience in performing services similar in size, content and complexity.  The past performance aspect considers how well the contractor performed on similar projects.

4.d. Cost/Price Evaluation:  This factor considers the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed cost/price to repair or replace components of the system.  While price is not the primary evaluation factor, it is important and will be considered when determining who will be awarded the contract.

5.  Base Bid and Options
The contractor shall submit a quote for the cost to maintain the system as well as additional costs in the event any of the equipment should fail (e.g. cost to replace any equipment not under warranty)

7. Hours of Work
All work shall be performed on a needs basis.  If any or all of the equipment fails, the contractor shall be present within 24 hours notice upon request by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Technical Representative to repair the system.

8. Sanitation Facilities
The Contractor shall be permitted use of the facilities in building 3172, provided that his/her personnel or any subcontractor, do not create any additional cleaning burden upon the U.S. Coast Guard.

9. Removed Materials
All parts of the installed video surveillance system are owned and operated by the United States Government.  Under no circumstance shall any equipment be removed from the grounds of Air Station Cape Cod without the approval of the Contracting Officer and Property Officer.  The removed equipment shall be replaced and/or repaired as soon as possible prior to re-installation.  Material that requires disposal shall be disposed of in an appropriate manner.  The Contractor and a government representative shall determine the appropriate disposal method.  The government will assume responsibility for those items that require disposal and salvage in accordance with CG policy.

This material shall be disposed of by the Contractor at a Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) certified solid waste facility.  The Contractor shall not cause, suffer, allow, or permit handling, transportation, or storage of any material in a manner that results, or may result, in emissions that cause or contribute to a condition of air pollution.

10. Coordination of Contract Work with Government Activities
The Government will continue to work within its buildings and areas during all maintenance activities.  The Government will keep interference with the Contractors operations to a minimum.  This is an active aircraft maintenance and operations unit, therefore the Contractor will make all efforts to not interfere with the unit’s operations.

<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN San Diego intends to issue a modification to an existing contract N66001-04-D-5019 previously awarded on a sole source basis to Telcom Network Team, a small San Diego, CA business.  The contract covers JTF WARNET, IBGWN, NGN, WNW, VRC-99 radio and other systems engineering support services, development and integration into the Navy's IT-21 Communication Architecture. The Government intends to extend the Period of Performance with TNT through 09 February 2006. The current period of performance expires 09 February 2005. The ceiling price of the contract remains unchanged. This modification is necessary due to anticipated funding not being provided as originally anticipated at the time of award. This extension will allow the Government to successfully complete the existing effort as originally anticipated.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Mar 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06; and FY 07 by 15 Nov 06.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2007, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to use innovative, disruptive technologies to collect and process ELINT signals and their associated SIGINT information.  Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and enhanced or new digital processing hardware/software, will be used to: (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management; and (3) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software analysis to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future. 

The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following:  (1) Target specific characteristics identification/ correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) levels;  (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Network centric collection management .

Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows:  (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation:  Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources.  One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a “brute-force/labor intensive” effort:  (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing.  Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets.  This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination ('flagging') of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized.  Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes using ‘fingerprinting’ techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts; Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars.  (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing:  Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena.  Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives:  Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Host processing systems will be low power and weight so the resident software processing systems will need to employ a digital receiver and processing schema that operate modularly, in parallel, and in firmware.  (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques:  Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (6) Network centric collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-int sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management.  Deliverables will be technical reports, any software developed, and, when appropriate, demonstrations. 

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $8.0M; FY 06 - $8.5M; and FY07 - $8.0M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $250,000 to $350,000 per fiscal year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current sources, i.e., General Electric Company and BAE Systems, Inc.

Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award.  The solicitation will contain instructions for obtaining further information on this requirement.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with General Electric Aircraft Engines, Cincinnati, OH.

Note:  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

Responsible sources who can provide the above requirements may submit written quotations no later than 15 days from published date of this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, spare parts, materials, and work uniforms, except those furnished by the Government, for the operation and maintenance, facilities operations, management and administrative support services to Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) and Information Technology (IT) support for the Sugarcane Research Unit (SRU). The performance work statement (PWS) specifies the services required to provide the full range of operational and maintenance support to the Center twenty-four hours a day seven days a week. 

Facilities operations and maintenance functions shall include the areas of work management, preventive maintenance, building maintenance, shop services, alteration and repair, ground maintenance, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, electrical, housekeeping, information technology and administrative services.  

The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with all applicable USA and Louisiana State laws, regulations, codes, technical manual specifications, manufacturer’s guidelines, and USDA and ARS directives unless otherwise specified or directed. The Contractor shall prepare and submit required reports, compile historical data, perform administrative work, and submit any necessary information as requested or specified.

This type of assistance normally would be in the locating of various utility lines, valves, piping, switches, relocating equipment or components, moving equipment or components, shutting down or turning on of various equipment, utilities, valves, and switches. Depending on the complexity, on average this would take about one hour total per any one task.  Such functions are in direct support of the research mission of the Center.

Answer #1:  This is a new requirement.  Previously, this requirement was handled via several different contract vehicles and contract types.

Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (10-20-04) Change in Pricing Strategy The first draft Request for Proposal (RFP) stated that the pricing structure  for the contract will be 5 years firm-fixed-price (FFP), 3 years fixed price  with economic price adjustment (FP/EPA), and 2 years Not to Exceed (NTE).  As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. ***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. DHHS/OPHEP/ORDC has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of novel therapeutic products for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to treat U.S. civilians exposed to weapons of mass destruction, including nerve agents.  Nerve agents include organophosphorous insecticides, soman, sarin, tabun, VX and Non-Traditional Agents (NTA’s).  HU-BCHE has been demonstrated to be effective as a prophylactic against nerve agent induced mortality and morbidity.  HU-BChE is isolated and purified from the Cohn Fraction IV-4 of human plasma. The Government has an interest in identifying sources of GMP HU-BChE and developing capabilities for the licensure of an appropriately formulated preparation of HU-BChE for either intravenous or intramuscular injection.  While proof-of-principle animal studies have been completed, additional animal challenge studies are likely needed to support the eventual licensure of the product. In responding to this RFI, indicate the proposed process for extraction and purification; potential formulations for intramuscular injection; and production capacity annually (estimate).  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources of HU-BChE, manufactured under a commercial scale GMP process, tested for efficacy in animal models of nerve agent exposure and for safety in human volunteers.  Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Information must be submitted by March 15, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, phone 202-401-3693, email darrick.early@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted.

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

This PRDA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. Technical POC: James Perretta, Laboratory Program Manager; telephone: 315-330-2632; email: James.Perretta@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC:  Lori Smith, Contracting Officer; telephone: 315-330-1955; email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  The AFRL Sensors Directorate at the Rome Research Site, as DARPA/ATO's technical and program execution agent, is soliciting white papers for innovative next generation spectrum assignment approaches to improve effective spectrum use for communications and sensors. This is a four-year open-ended Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development white papers for the DARPA/AFRL Next Generation communications program. The desired overall result of the XG program is the transformation of spectrum assignment technology for DoD applications through dynamic spectral use. This effort covers a broad range of requirements in the area of next generation radio frequency spectrum use. Emphasis is placed on novel dynamic, autonomous spectrum assignment methodologies for communications and sensing, through integration and application of technology that can increase spectrum access through adaptive use of available spectrum. Concepts are sought in one of more of the following areas: a. Real-time sensing of spectrum usage; b. Real-time Characterization spectrum usage; c. Autonomously Reacting to and planning spectrum usage through selection of frequency, waveform, directionality, polarization, temporal characteristics and other novel usage approaches; d. Dynamically adapting to changes in spectrum usage. Although implementation is not required, communications techniques that are extensible to include Information Security (INFOSEC), Transmission Security (TRANSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) are desired. Awardees will prepare concepts and designs for demonstrations to address these requirements, and will perform analysis of the anticipated performance, including increases in spectrum access over existing technologies and practices.  BACKGROUND.  Currently, U.S. forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate, due to competing civilian and government users of spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force planning, and may preclude the operation of critical systems. Coalition and Allied operations are even more complex to manage, and spectrum assignment issues may severely limit the U.S.'s ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information technology. We need a mechanism for rapid and efficient utilization of the shrinking military bandwidth in the dynamic environment of the 21st century and a viable solution to the commercial carriers' demands for additional spectrum. Assured communications (currently limited by spectrum availability) will be the difference between success and failure in the modern battlespace. The need for higher and more complex data services (a projected 250% increase in the next 10 years), coupled with the explosion of the commercial wireless market (request for additional 100 MHz of DoD assigned spectrum for 3rd Generation cellular), strain the current limits of military spectrum allocations both domestically and abroad. The military is transitioning to new warfighting systems (that require high degrees of situation awareness for survival) and new doctrine (that requires connectivity for coordination). It is estimated that temporal and spatial reuse of the spectrum by DoD emitters is much less than 1%. This low utilization is due to the inefficient use of the available bandwidth by legacy communications systems and allocation procedures. Additionally, the current and projected in-garrison problems are compounded by the inconsistencies of the international spectrum allocation environment when forces deploy. The advent of dynamic spectrum allocation will ameliorate the potential crisis for DoD spectrum availability for military and government systems. Dynamic spectrum allocation and control will require developments significantly beyond those taking place in the 3rd Generation cellular world, taking the U.S. beyond the 3rd Generation and into the next generation following it. It is the intent of AFRL and DARPA to fill this development need. The DARPA neXt Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through the dynamic redistribution of allocated spectrum. DARPA's vision is to develop and demonstrate a range of innovative approaches to enabling technologies and system concepts to improve spectral utilization of military radio frequency emitters by a factor of 20. The XG program approach is to develop the theoretical underpinnings for dynamic control of the spectrum, the technologies and subsystems that enable reallocation of the spectrum, and the system appliqu? prototypes to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequency emitters. The approach plans to investigate methods to leverage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access and control (MAC) protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The proposed program goals are to develop, integrate, and evaluate the technology to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure operation of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate an applique for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The program will develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide assured military communications in support of worldwide, short notice deployments through the dynamic redistribution of allocated spectrum. This research will have significant impact on a wide variety of existing and future communications systems in the DoD and commercial environments. Specific areas of operational impact include: radars of all types, ground and air tactical communications, unmanned/robotic vehicle operations, data/video links and commercial mobile wireless operations. It is also expected to provide the common technical architecture that will meet the needs of both military and civilian future (beyond 3G) mobile communication and radar systems. This effort will require the involvement of a wide variety of government (joint and service laboratories) and commercial technology development centers and the support of the service operational communities and government spectrum agencies, Federal Communications Commission and the Office of Spectrum Analysis and Management (FCC & OSAM). These organizations have been briefed and support the effort. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to ten (10) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All white papers submitted in responses to this PRDA must be addressed to ATTN: James Perretta, Reference PRDA 02-01-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers will be accepted until 30 Sep 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other white papers/proposals submitted under the announcement. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY02 - 7 Dec 01; FY03 - 30Jun02; FY04 - 30Jun03; FY05 – 1 August 2005. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and /or techniques, and c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees. Also, consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used. No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals. The technical criteria will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY02. Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200,000 to $750,000 per year. Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $20M. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Lori Smith, for information if they contemplate responding. Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. The work to be performed may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore in those instances, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at time of award. The cost of preparing white papers and proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. This PRDA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. A copy of the publication "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry" may be accessed here: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The CUGR Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program is seeking to identify existing sensors or systems, which will provide detection, identification, and collection capabilities.  These sensors sought need to be small, rug ged, and use minimal power in order to facilitate integration on a small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV).  Detectors must be able to relay status and control to/from an external controller by means such as serial, infrared (IRDA) or Ethernet.  Detection capa bilities sought include detection and identification of chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals and radiological materials.  Environmental sensors that provide O2, LEL/UEL, VOC, CO, and H2S detection are also required.  Use of multiple sensors to provide this capability is acceptable.  Detectors must use a proven detection technology and have independent test data and user data to verify their performance.  In addition to detection and identification, ECBC seeks to identify products capable of c ollecting liquid and solid samples that are suitable for deployment on a UGV.  Products must be suitably mature and available to support system integration and technical testing in mid FY06, followed by operational demonstration in late FY06.  This call for product information is open to DoD contractors, commercial entities, and US government agencies.  Companies and organizations that would like their detection/identification/collection products considered for use in the CUGR ACTD will be provided with detailed instructions for submitting product specifications, submission templates , and detailed CUGR needs.  Requests for this information should be made by e-mail to cugr@battelle.org or call (410) 306-8600.  This request must provide the requestor's name, company or organization, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Material solutions and concepts may be submitted anytime before COB 4 Feb 05. Participation in the CUGR ACTD solution concept solicitation is totally voluntary, and the government does not intend to award any contracts or pay any costs associated with this solicitation.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE REAL-TIME MULTIPLICITY COUNTER AND FISSION METER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's real-time multiplicity counter and fission meter.

Scientists at LLNL have invented a neutron detector that can be used to discriminate fissile material from non-fissile material.  It consists of a low cost digital data acquisition unit that collects data at high rate, and in real-time processes large volumes of data directly into information that a first responder can use to discriminate materials.

The standard approach to locating neutron sources is to use a neutron detector to look for count rate increases above background.  Given the number of legitimate neutron sources used in industry, deploying standard neutron detectors will result in a large number of alarms that will need to be resolved by more intrusive inspections.   LLNL has developed a simple way to discriminate the commonly used neutron sources from illicit (fissile) neutron sources.  This technique functions in a passive mode much like a standard portal monitor. There are options for converting the technique to an active interrogation scheme.  

Government and commercial uses for this technology include mobile or stationary monitoring and characterization of the type of neutron sources inside packages.  Some examples of uses include inspection of packed cargo containers and trucks.

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention.  In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention. 

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's real-time multiplicity counter should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology including any experience in analyzing nuclear materials.  

Written responses should be directed to:
	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 99-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest.

<SUBJECT>A -- Photoactive Compounds that Selectively Inactivate Viruses Ready for Vaccine and Therapeutics Development
<DESC>The Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology (LECB) at the National Cancer Institute, NIH is seeking a collaborative partner under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop vaccines and therapeutics using photoactive compounds that selectively inactivate viruses.  These non-toxic photoactive agents accumulate in the membrane bilayer of the viral envelope and upon irradiation with light will bind to the proteins and lipids in this domain thereby blocking fusion of the virus with target cells.  Conformational integrity is retained preserving the immunogenicity of the agent.  Development of vaccines and therapeutics utilizing this technology could be directed towards HIV or other viruses of interest to the public health or biodefense efforts.

Potential Commercial Areas:
•	Vaccines and therapeutics for HIV, SARS, Asian Bird Flu, and other viruses of interest to the public health
•	Vaccines and therapeutics for biodefense efforts.

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:
•	Agents are non-toxic.
•	Conformational integrity is retained preserving agent’s immunogenicity.		
•	Inactivates fusion activity and thus blocks entry of the virus into target cells.
•	Can be generally applied to all membrane containing pathogens including bacteria and parasites.

Current State of Development:
•	Compounds have been identified and protocols have been developed for the inactivation of HIV-1 and SIV.
•	The inactivated HIV is completely non-infectious in and reacts as well as the live virus with three anti HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.
•	The mechanism of inactivation is the elimination of fusion activity.  All studies were carried out in vitro using cultured cell lines.

Further R&D Required:
•	Develop and test vaccines against viral agents.
•	Pre-clinical and animal testing of HIV/SIV vaccines in non-human primate models.
•	Develop therapeutics to treat viral infection and AIDS.
•	Organic synthesis of lipid analogues and probes for biological membranes.

Patent Status:
•	DHHS Reference No. E-303-2003/0-US-01 

Submission Dates:
•	Interested parties should provide a 1-2 page statement describing their organization and scientific capabilities by February 18, 2005.  
•	All responses received by the deadline will be considered.  If no CRADA partner is selected from the initial responses received by the deadline, this CRADA opportunity may remain open until a CRADA partner is identified.

FPED's genesis was the 25 June 1996 Khobar To wers bombing and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's desire to find commercial off-the-shelf materiel solutions to force protection needs. The purpose of the demonstration is to show leaders and decision-makers what is available to help meet their force protection needs.  The inaugural demonstration in 1997 demonstrated and displayed force protection equipment from 184 vendors and was primarily intended for the Department of Defense (DoD).  FPED V will bring more than 500 vendors and organizations w ith over 2,500 items of force protection equipment to be viewed by attendees from DoD, federal departments and agencies, state and local law enforcement and other first responders, corrections agencies and foreign attendees.  There are twenty categories of  equipment that include blast and ballistics mitigation, night vision and optics, barriers, individual protective equipment, non-lethal weaponry, chemical/biological detection, protection and mitigtion, explosive detection and cargo inspection devices, bio metrics, and others.  Range demonstrations are conducted to demonstrate the blast, ballistics and non-lethal products.  A night vision demonstration will be conducted the nights of 26 and 27 April.   Attendee on-line registration is currently available by going to www.fped5.org and clicking the Registration button located under FPED V Attendees.  With over 500 vendors and organizations, 2,500 equipment items, range demonstrations, and a night vision demonstration, a 2-day visit is strongly recommended.  Att endees desiring to receive their show badge prior to the demonstration should register prior to 29 March 2005.   The points of contact for FPED V are Mr. Jim Suarez or Mr. Ken Shaw.

e.	Features common to all gloveboxes and pass-thru chambers:

Heavy, 12 gauge, type 304 stainless steel construction with easy to clean, full radius corners that prevent the build-up of contaminants and resist corrosion.
All interior glove box surfaces and pass-through door surfaces shall have a powder-coated, baked-on epoxy finish.  Hinging and latching components will be plastic- or epoxy-coated where practical.
All glovebox chambers will be designed to operate continuously at a negative 0.5” water column pressure for maximum personnel and product protection.  The pressure will be continuously monitored and an audible alarm sounds if the air pressure conditions deviate from pre-set criteria.  
Externally mounted fluorescent light assembly will illuminate the work surface and will be serviceable from outside the glovebox to maintain product and personnel protection during maintenance.
Eight inch diameter ABS glove ports with one piece sleeve and glove assembly built directly into the view screen for improved visibility and ergonomics.  
All interior and exterior glovebox doors will be tested to Class II Biological Safety Cabinet specifications using a 2” soap bubble test.  Gas-tight doors and view screens maintain air conditions internally.
Each chamber shall have a decontamination gas inlet and outlet port equipped with gas tight manually controlled ball valves.
All gloves shall be one-piece butyl, left, right, and ambidextrous types as defined by CDC.
All support stands shall be constructed from type 304 stainless steel.
Each chamber shall be provided with a junction box for electrical power connections.
Each cabinet control panel shall have a circuit breaker switch for its integral blower.
Each chamber shall have nitrogen inlet and outlet ports with inline HEPA filters and air tight manually operated ball valves.  Nitrogen flow rate to be specified by customer.  
All glovebox view screens will be constructed of 3/8” thick laminated safety glass 

f.	Exhaust Manifold:  (Not part of this quotation, to be supplied by others)

The exhaust manifolds shall be positioned in the interstitial space over each line and connect to each exhaust outlet.
Minimum ceiling height requirement is ten feet.
Flow rate shall be the sum of all the cabinets and the bypass flow for each line.
Manifold should be 6” high by 24” wide to keep maximum duct velocity below 2,000 feet per minute.
Manifold should be equipped with multi-function air bypass:
Canopy connection for glove box line
General room exhaust for lab ventilation requirements
Exhaust bypass during glovebox decontamination.
The manifold should be equipped with a pressure switch that will cut power to all glovebox blowers should the manifold pressure deviate above a predetermined value.
Bypass design should be coordinated with lab ventilation engineers.  The recommendation is to use a variable flow damper which maintains an exhaust manifold static pressure of -0.1” w.c.  

g.	Exhaust Manifold Matrix

Manifold Inlet Component Flow Rate(cfm)Flow Restrictions
                                       (inches water column)
2’ pass-thru	             50	               0
4’ glovebox	             350	       0
6’ glovebox	             450	       0
6’ class II, type B3	     550	       0.1
4’ glovebox	             350	       0
2’ pass-thru	              50	       0
Gx / decon bypass	     165-2	      tbd-3
Totals	                     1965-1	      0.1-4


Notes:

Total flow is based on preliminary HVAC design criteria of 840 cfm for class II and 1125 cfm for gloveboxes.
The Gx / decontamination bypass creates a canopy exhaust connection for the glove box line to the building exhaust.  It serves to decouple the glove box blowers from the building blower thus improving air flow balancing procedures.  In addition, the bypass grill can be designed to handle a greater flow rate while one or more glove boxes are sealed off for decontamination, thus maintaining laboratory airflow and pressure requirements.  
The restriction of the bypass will depend on the required bypass flow during decontamination.
The chambers and bypass are manifolded in parallel, thus the greatest restriction will dictate the manifold static pressure.  Each of the glove box chamber is equipped with integral exhaust blowers which handle their restrictions.  The class II cabinet with the canopy exhaust connection requires the manifold to be at approximately -0.1” w.c.  in order to pull air in through the canopy gap.  The manifold pressure may be determined by the bypass flow requirements.

h.	Other Requirements:

Per CDC requirements, all exposed metal within the gloveboxes shall be epoxy-coated.  All CDC cleaning agents should be carefully selected to avoid breakdown of the epoxy coating.
Class III gloveboxes are not required for this particular application.  These gloveboxes will not be designed or tested to meet the more stringent Class III requirements.
Operators Manual:  A complete operators manual includes factory acceptance test reports and lists of all replacement parts will be supplied.  The operators manual contains directions for all routine maintenance.
Kick off meeting: Prior to design and construction a factory engineer will meet with CDC end users and engineers in Atlanta for a one day final design meeting to address all outstanding concerns and issues associated with the custom made glovebox line.  Any additional factory engineer on-site visits requested by CDC will be at an additional cost.

2.	Installation

Because of the special nature of the two custom built glovebox lines, installation by factory service technicians is required.  The equipment will be received at the CDC loading dock by Government personnel, then moved into the laboratory and installed by the contractor.  A soap-bubble pressure test shall be run to insure integrity.

Any and all external facilities connections will be made by others (electrical, HVAC, gasses, etc.).

STATEMENT OF WORK
INTRODUCTION
The goal of the Regional Vulnerability Assessment Program (ReVA) is to develop and demonstrate a methodology to identify the ecosystems at the greatest risk from regional population growth and economic activity.  A region is a multi-state area involving many metropolitan areas and drainage basins and the associated  ecosystems and cultural infrastructure.  Vulnerability implies that an ecosystem is at risk of losing the ability to continue to supply the goods and services that the public has come to value, including priceless assets such as biodiversity and rare or endangered species and ecosystems.  ReVA is particularly concerned with comparing risks arising from all sources of potential harm, acting alone or in combination, over the entire region.  Because regional risks require regional (as opposed to national) responses, ReVA focuses on risk communication to inform decisions at regional to local scales and prioritize environmental protection and risk management efforts.  ReVA is a cross-ORD project led by the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) in Research Triangle Park, NC.  As part of the risk communication effort ReVA is creating a suite of web-based toolkits geared to client partners at the EPA regional level (R3 and R4), state governments (MD, PA,NC and SC), and local governments (Councils of Government in NC and SC).  ReVA is working directly with these partners to increase accessibility to ReVA’s tools and information .

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to competitively procure Aerial Refueling Store Improved Power Source (ARSIPS) Handling Fixture.  This tool has been deemed necessary as the weight of an ARSIPS unit exceeds the maximum one-person lift limit as defined by the United States Naval Safety Center.  In addition to exceeding the weight limit, carrying an ARSIPS unit by the blades will be avoided, thus preventing possible personnel injury and damage ARSIPS units.   
The ARSIPS Handling Tool will give fleet maintainers of the A/A 42R-1 Aerial Refueling Store the capability to transport, remove and replace ARSIPS units.  This tool will be utilized primarily at F/A-18 E/F organizational and intermediate levels of maintenance.  	A qty of (1) unit each of the ARSIPS Handling Tool will be provided as a First Article Test unit and if accepted will become part of the deliverables.   Delivery for the first article test unit is FOB destination toLakehurst, NJ.  The contractor shall manufacture thirty-eight  (38) ARSIPS Handling Tools with and option to purchase an additional sixteen (16) ARSIPS Handling Tools per the government supplied drawing package.  Deliveries of the ARSIPS Handling Tool shall be in quantities of 12 per month (third month shall be a quantity of fourteen (14)) beginning ninety (90) days after contract award.  Final inspection and acceptance by the Government will be at destination.  

1.	The contractor shall manufacture stated quantities of ARSIPS Handling Tools in accordance with the government-supplied drawings in the stated period of time.

2.	Any deviation from the ARSIPS Handling Tool drawing package will be reviewed for the strict purpose of reducing production cost and increasing productivity, for example; a part that could be produced through casting rather than machining.  However, it must be shown the cast part will meet all structural requirements imposed on a machined piece.  Other possibilities include using a different material that is called out on the drawing. 

3.	DCMA will be used for quality assurance and final inspection of all units (DD-250).

4.	The contractor will ship all manufactured ARSIPS Handling Tools to Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst New Jersey.  Each ARSIPS Handling Tool will be packaged in such a means to protect the tool during shipment.  

5.	Monthly progress reports to the Aerial Refueling System Support Equipment manager will be required. 




Specifications for the ARSIPS Handling Fixture are subject to Export Control regulations and will only be released to firms who are certified with the DLSC for receipt of Military Critical Technical Data.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.

BACKGROUND:  1.1. The Arc antenna range is located at the Antenna Test Facility (ATF) and is operated by the Electronic P roving Ground (EPG) at Ft. Huachuca, AZ.  It is an outdoor antenna range capable of taking hemispherical antenna patterns (elevation angles from -15 to 90 degrees, with 360-degree capability in azimuth).  The operational frequency range is 30 MHz to18 GHz.   The Arc range was specifically designed to measure the patterns of communication antennas mounted on military vehicles, though it supports a variety of antenna tests.  The Arcs focus is 30 above ground level, and its radius is 75.  A fiberglass rack i s used to place the test antenna at the Arcs focal point.  This rack is placed on a 60 diameter turntable that is capable of supporting 80 tons.  Spacious walkways allow access under the turntable, and the turntable presently supports 12 slip rings.  The  Arcs control room is located in a large pit approximately 30 from the base of the Arc.  The azimuth and elevation motions are controlled by an MI-Technologies 4190 controller, and only one axis moves at a time.  The upgrade discussed below essentially  involves a replacement of the entire RF system, including the source / receiver and any necessary cables, mixers, amplifiers, software, etc.  Interested providers are encouraged to visit the Arc range to ensure that they have all of the information necess ary to develop an accurate cost estimate.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, Arizona is soliciting proposals for the following requirement:   PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) FOR THE MICRO ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT MODULE (MEEM) PROJECT.  1.0  SCOPE.  Overall this is a two year project that consists of three phases.  Phase One MEEM Technical Analysis and Design and Phase Two Prototype development are planned for FY05.  Phase Three Produc tion units shall be executed in FY06.  Phase one shall result in an in depth analysis of the requirements, the target technology, and a full engineering design.  Phase Two shall result in 2 rough proof of concept prototypes and at least 4 final design prot otypes at near production level quality, form, fit, and function for Government evaluation before execution of Phase Three.  Phase One is the base contract with Phases Two and Three as options.  This contract will also contain an option for the engineering  analysis and design of a fast wide bandwidth receiver based upon the same digital signal processing (DSP) technology and hardware.  The requirements for this effort if funded will be in a separate PWS.  1.1  BACKGROUND.  The Electronic Proving Ground (EPG ) is the Armys developmental tester for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).  In performance of that mission and in support of Operational Testing EPG must provide the proper electromagnetic e nvironment for the system under test (SUT).  This environment includes intended and unintended radio frequency (RF) emissions from both threat systems as targets and other US systems sharing the battlefield sometimes as part of a common network.  In order to stress the SUT EPG must not only replicate the threat systems that an ISR system would try to exploit but we must also provide the participation and contribution of addition nodes and complimentary systems.  Lastly EPG must provide the threat systems an d countermeasures capabilities that would attempt to defeat the US C4 and ISR systems.  Automated, configurable instruments to simulate threat RF signatures provide a much more cost effective, flexible, and repeatable method of testing our intelligence ass ets.  This instrumentation exists for large vehicular based systems but not for dismounted troops.  1.2  GENERAL.  The goal of this project is to develop a very small, light weight, signal injection system to interface with man pack radios carried by dismo unted soldiers.  To increase utility and decrease risk and cost this project shall capitalize on existing concepts and technologies at EPG.  The Dense Environment RF Injection (DERFI) system utilizes state of the art digit signal processing technology and massive Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to produce any arbitrary signal modulation type on any of its 12 independent channels.  The Mobile Covert Electronic Warfare System (MCREWS) is EPGs 4 channel signal injection jammer with live and virtual mode s of operation.  The MEEM project shall combine the best aspects of DERFI and MCREWS to develop a small, light, inexpensive single channel RF injection devise for man pack radio applications.  MEEM shall be software compatible with DERFI and utilize the sa me modulation control files.  Each MEEM unit shall be separately addressable and operate over the same control network as the MCREWS.  Also MEEM shall employ the same live and Virtual modes of operation as MCREWS.  The emphasis will be upon emission fideli ty, miniaturization, automation (utilizing predefined scripts), remote control and status reporting (including ground truth), and compatibility with the existing EPG infrastructure.  A communica tions network will provide the ability to manage all the signal resources, download scenario information, and display real-time status from a central control center.

<DESC>This amendment is to address questions received from prospective contractors as follows:

3. The solicitation indicates that the course will be taught over a 6 1/2 day period. If the participants consent, can the course be taught in six days? (Probably by extending one or two days) The course consists of more than just the advance education portion and although some adjustments can be made, the contractor will primarily be held to the 6½ days allotted as per the schedule.	

4. Is there an incumbent contractor who is performing or has performed the work? If so, who? If so, is the government satisfied with the work?

·	Is this incumbent eligible to reapply for this project?  Yes

Scope of Work Timelines
13.	 What is the anticipated date of contract award (acceptance of proposal)? FISC contracting to establish to make the class convening date. 
 
14.	 After Receipt of Order (ARO), the solicitation specifies a vendor meeting with the COR and draft course materials due for review 21 days prior (February 7). Since the first class is anticipated to be offered on February 28, 2005, is this timeline negotiable or alterable?  This looks good, drafts can be negotiated, but class dates are firm and cannot be changed.
15.	
Initial course draft	Feb. 7, 2005 (21 days prior to course)
Course materials	Feb. 7, 2005 (21 days prior to course)

Submittal Requirements
17.	 Our understanding is that we distribute the Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey to companies with which we have worked.   Yes  


18.	Is there a specific number of surveys that you think would provide evidence of past performance?  No, at least one, but more is favorable.

·	If so, will that assessment be made immediately available to the vendor (or within what timeframe)? We have all our needs spelled out in the write-up and we assess each and every course/class both during and after. In addition who ever we contract we will work closely with and share all assessments/critiques with. 

21.	Who will serve as a subject matter expert to the vendor?   It is expected that the vendor will be the subject matter expert.  The COR will liaison to ensure relevant course material/instruction is delivered and then evaluate the vendor.

22.	Has a gap analysis been performed?  All students are senior Military (O-6) or Civilian Mangers (GS-14/15 and above).

Course Delivery
 Item 2.0 (Background) in the SOW states that the course focus will be “on today’s global electronic environment; gaining the perspectives to lead in the twenty-first century and orchestrating the widespread change needed for on-going success.” Can you clarify the meaning and intent of the phrase, “global electronic environment”?  This answer is in the solicitation it states “gaining the perspectives to lead in the twenty-first century and orchestrating the widespread change needed for on-going success”.

26.	 Do you expect that each of the course content topics (strategy, operations management, etc.) should relate specifically to this focus?  Yes

27.	Are there particular topics (such as innovation and IT management) with more “global electronic environment” emphasis, and others (performance management, communications, etc.) with less emphasis?  Yes… I think the Global electronic environment is not all encompassing

28.	What is the “widespread change” you have in mind (e.g., redesign of organizational and cultural structures, acquisition of new technologies, etc.)?  Yes

29.	Is there an expectation that software and software training be included as deliverables? No, This is a top-level educational course not a specific training course.
·	If so, might this be proprietary software currently in use by the NSSC? 
·	If so, will the vendor have access to this software for training purposes? 
·	If not proprietary, will the NSSC advise the contractor of preferred software to use in the course?

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world.  A bitter civil war from 1992-1997 stunted Tajikistan’s economic development, hindered economic reforms and discouraged foreign investment.  The security situation has dramatically improved since the conclusion of Tajikistan’s civil war peace accords in 1997.  President Rakhmonov is eager to implement structural and economic reforms and has identified foreign investment as a top priority.  The United States government has been more pro-active in Tajikistan over the last year and is committed to promoting reform in Tajikistan.  

One of the areas that the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe believes has good potential for investment is the mining sector.  Tajikistan has rich natural resources including deposits of uranium, mercury, lead, zinc, antimony, tungsten, silver and gold.  Should these resources be developed, they could provide a hard currency source for Tajikistan.  Foreign firms, including a British company, are already involved in this sector in Tajikistan.  The Embassy believes that USTDA’s involvement at this stage is key to attracting interest in this sector from American companies.

USTDA funded a DM on this sector in 1997, which was conducted by the US Geological Survey.  The DM had some difficulty in obtaining sufficient information from the Tajiks but reported at that time that there are significant precious metal resources and medium sized gold deposits.  The report also noted that there was a significant lack of information on geology, resources, mining laws and procedures for obtaining exploration permits.
Now that there is interest in foreign investment and a greater interest from the Tajik side in cooperation, we believe that it is an appropriate time to take a second look at this sector.
As Country Manager Scott Greenip is planning to be in Dushanbe, Tajikistan February 9-11, it would be helpful if the DM Contractor could be in Tajikistan at the same time.

Would the Government consider the use of these existing e-mail system(s)in conjunction with the offered fax service? A2.  Yes.  That is the current system in use. Q3. Please provide addresses and NPA-NXX (area code/exchange) for all facilities where service is required. A3.  Phone numbers are provided by the vendor to allow for the following: 1. Serves as a return fax number for anyone who sends a fax to the recipient using a standard fax machine or electronic web based fax service. This allows the use of standard devices and existing phone lines for all who use the electronic web based fax ser vice 2. In SOME cases it also serves as the individual account number for tracking and billing purposes. Individuals are provided with a number, each activity or group of activities would have a master corporate account under which all individual fax numbers ar e listed. This allows for activity reports, usage tracking and general reporting functions.  The idea being to allow the user to send and receive a fax to or from a third party. This type of software uses the phone number as a return fax number and prints it on the outgoing fax just as a standard fax machine would. It also facilitates a third par ty to send a fax from a standard fax machine to the user with no additional software or equipment needed.  It also negates the need for the electronic web based fax user to buy traditional fax machines and additional phone lines
