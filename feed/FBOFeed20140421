<p>The majority of the renovation is required to meet ICD 705 security standards and therefore attention to security details and coordination with the government will be required for inspection and certification of the spaces.<br /><br />When the solicitation is placed on FBO.gov for download it is treated as a secured project therefore you must follow the steps on FBO to be granted access to download. Access to download from FBO.gov will be granted to Prime Contractors only. Third-party vendors will NOT be granted access.</p>
<p>To download documents that are designated as "export controlled," you must be certified as a U.S. contractor by the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS). Certification for ICD 705 security requirements is obtained by submitting a DD Form 2345 to the Defense Logistics Information Services Joint Certification Program (JCP). The JCP certifies contractors of U.S. and Canada for access, on an equally favorable basis, to unclassified technical data disclosing critical technology controlled by Department of Defense (DoD). The DD Form 2345 can be found at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.</p>
<p>Also, you must complete the attached memo "Contractor Control of Plans" and return to the contract specialist, prior to being granted access to download from FBO.</p>
<p>For answers to questions you may have regarding the certification process please see the FAQ's on DLIS website: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/Faq.aspx#Q2</p>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: Industra-Seal 117A is lithium-silicate densifier with siliconate stain repellent designed to densify and add stain resistant waterproofing characteristics to cement and concrete substrates. The densifier reacts with the cementicious ingredients to densify and add water repellency while allowing deep penetration to chemically harden and fortify the substrate. After the chemical reaction occurs, the substrate will be more abrasion resistant and help protect the surface from wear, moisture and efflorescence while remaining breathable.
COLOR: Clear. Tint available in a variety of colors. PACKAGING INFORMATION: This product is available in 5 gallon and 50 gallon containers (approximately 8.5 pounds/gallon).

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: V-SCRUB NATURAL is a pH neutral heavy duty industrial strength cleaner formulated for versatility and dependability.  Unlike many industrial strength cleaners, V-SCRUB NATURAL is 100% biodegradable and environmentally safe utilizing a unique formula containing terpene hydrocarbons, a natural component of oranges. It contains no caustics, butyl ethers, chlorinated solvents, or petroleum based solvents.  The versatility of this product is enhanced by complete water reducibility to assure the capability to customize the cleaning strength to meet specific needs.  V-SCRUB NATURAL is a concentrated non-flammable detergent that dissolves a wide range of greases and oil based soils while leaving the area with a mild refreshing scent.  As a water reducible cleaner, the ability to work with and around most metals is assured by the addition of flash rust additives and inhibiters.  This product is compatible with most industrial coatings including epoxies and urethanes.

<DESC><p>Project Title: "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)"</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for a 100% set-aside for small businesses with under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 519130 "Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals," with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is contemplating an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award for an information technology partnership network and communication technology project entitled, "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)." The anticipated period of performance for the contract is sixty months. Place of Performance will be determined on individual task orders. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about March 25, 2014. Requests for Proposals in hard copy form will not be available to interested parties. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background for the Acquisition</span>: The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is one of three national Centers housed within CDC's Office of Infectious Diseases (OID).</p>
<p>The National Center for HIV/AIDS, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) was established in 1994 to bring together most of CDC's HIV prevention activities under a single organizational home with sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and tuberculosis (TB) elimination programs. In 2006, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) was added, and the Center was renamed the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.</p>
<p>The diseases addressed by NCHHSTP share a number of commonalities. They have similar or overlapping at-risk populations-including racial and ethnic minorities, men who have sex with men (MSM), and injection drug users (IDUs). These diseases also have important interactions. Those who are infected with certain STDs, such as syphilis or gonorrhea, are at greater risk for HIV infection. Likewise, those who are infected with HIV are far more susceptible to TB disease because their immune systems are weakened.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Objectives</span>: The project initiative is to support the following: (1) the CDC and NCHHSTP efforts in providing timely information and resources to prevention partners through innovative approaches to knowledge/information transfer; (2) to connect partners in public health through collaborative communication, innovative technology solutions, and customer service; (3) to provide Web-based online databases, information resources, and technical assistance via online support, and (4) to support and apply inovation using digital channels to enhancing connection among and engagement with prevention partners and stakeholders to maximize health impact of NCHHSTP's Programs.</p>
<p>These diseases also share similar social determinants, including poor access to health care, stigma, discrimination, homophobia, and poverty. In the area of prevention and control, effective, science-based interventions exist to reduce the burden of TB, viral hepatitis, most STDs, and HIV.</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Scope of Work</span>: The scope of work will entail two domains. Domain One will encompass Information and Communication Technology, which will involve the following focus areas: (1) Digital Media Channel Development and Enhancement, (2) Database Development, Analysis, and Management, (3) Special Data Products, (4) Web Content Management System (WCMS), (5) Scanning and Implementation of New Technologies and Best Practices. Domain Two is Communication and Education, which will involve the following focus areas: (1) Web-based Information Development and Management; (2) Digital Media Channel Management (including social media); (3) Digital Media Metrics (web analytics); (4) Communication Support Services; (5) Training and Technical Assistance; (6) Marketing and Outreach; and (7) Scanning and Implementation of New Technologies and Best Practices.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipoment, as appropriate to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-On Requirement</span>: This requirement is a follow-on contract requirement. The current contract vendor for the current contract is Danya International.</p>

BACKGROUND / SCOPE OF WORK: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for its Emergency Notification System (ENS).  This solution must have a proven track record within the Federal market to broadcast alerts and warnings to its employees in emergency and life-threatening situations.  This system will broadcast to both mobile and fixed assets (e.g., desk telephone, cellular telephone, email, SMS, etc) and will have the ability to receive responses from the recipients to account for and aid in their safety.  Fixed asset notifications will include computer display pop-up messages (desktop pop-ups) that appear in the foreground of the recipients computer screen display and persist until acknowledged.  The system will have the ability to target alerts and warnings by managing groups based on organizational, functional and geographical specifications and have the flexibility to be placed into pre-determined or on-the-fly categories.  Group creation and management must be permission based.  All alerts and warnings shall be customizable, repeatable, and have the ability to be prioritized.  Reporting and audit tracking will be required.
The system shall include a flexible Application Programming Interface (API) allowing synchronization with Active Directory (AD), and various agency databases.  The system shall be extendable programmatically or through a workflow process so that it can interface and initiate transaction in an external system. To protect personally identifiable information (PII) and the sensitivity of the alerts and warnings being sent the system must reside on government servers located behind the agency firewall.  Due to the sensitivity of the information being sent any third party handling the distribution of the messages must be a U.S. interest. 

The final scope and size of this project has not yet been determined, however, the current estimate is up to a one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) user system.  The contract will have one (1) base and four (4) option years.  Period of Performance (PoP) would run from FY 2015 through FY 2019. 
 
MARKET SURVEY PURPOSE:  

The purpose of this market survey is to inform industry of this requirement and to obtain information that the FAA may consider in choosing how to conduct this procurement and whether it should be a full and open competition, a limited competition, or set-aside.

BOILER PLANT SERVICE
STATEMENT OFWORK
Inspection, Testing and Calibration
Boiler Plant Burners, Controls, Instruments and Data Management

Introduction:
This Statement of Work describes all requirements for the inspection, testing, calibration, and combustion tuning of the boiler plant burners, controls and instruments by qualified technicians
Boiler plant safety, reliability, efficiency and equipment longevity are paramount concerns of VAMC management.  Malfunctioning burners or controls can cause catastrophic events resulting in injuries and death and massive property damage. Inaccurate or inadequate data management and monitoring systems can fail to warn of unsafe or inefficient performance.  Regular inspections, testing and calibration by expert technicians are an essential part of a program to address these concerns.
Appendix A, attached, lists the specific equipment models and ratings of each boiler.
A separate Statement of Work document covers the inspections of the boilers and feed water Deaerator by Qualified Professional Inspectors.
Technician Qualifications:
Technicians shall have completed at least a one-year trade school and have five years successful experience in this field.  The experience shall be largely with institutional and industrial boiler plants similar in design to the VAMC plant.  The VAMC facility manager/engineer may define and accept equivalent qualifications.
Technicians shall demonstrate familiarity with and ready access to the current versions of the following references:
1.	NFPA 85, Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code.
2.	VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual, 3rd Edition.
Technicians shall be equipped with portable electronic flue gas analyzers and other test instruments necessary for the required tests and calibrations, all calibrated within one month of the site visits.  This facility has programmable digital controls; all technicians must be capable of programming the controls and have the appropriate hardware and software for this.


Inspection, Testing and Calibration Requirements:
Technicians shall perform inspection, tuning, testing, calibrating, and adjustments of burners and boiler and boiler plant controls as specified below. This shall be done every six months in accordance with the schedule provided by VAMC. VAMC may extend the schedule for burners in limited service. Two (2) Semi-annual services for each Boiler and Two (2) Tune-Up Services for each Boiler are specifically covered by this service.
Instrumentation, monitoring and data management systems as listed below shall be calibrated every six months.
Provide at least a two week notice to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) prior to performing the work. Work cannot be scheduled during heavy steam load periods. Only one boiler at a time can be out of service for the inspection, testing and calibration procedures. Work must be conducted when the COR or a designee is available on site to monitor the work.
VAMC will have the boilers that are to be serviced prepared for the technicians upon their scheduled arrival. This includes having the boilers clean of soot and loose scale; fully warmed and at normal steam pressure.
All inspections, testing and calibrations shall comply with:
1.	The recommendations and requirements of VHA Boiler Plant Safety Devices Testing Manual, 3rd Edition.
2.	The written recommendations of the equipment manufacturers.
3.	The requirements and recommendations of NFPA 85 Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code including applicable appendices.
4.	Burner performance requirements in this document.
A summary of the work is as follows:
1.	Review boiler plant log sheets and alarm and trouble reports.
2.	Review records that show combustion performance (flue gas oxygen and carbon monoxide).
3.	Perform overall visual inspection of systems.  Verify that systems comply with referenced codes and VAMC requirements stated in this contract.
4.	Test and record the operation and set points of all burner/boiler safety interlock devices.  Refer to list below.  Verify that the set points and operating points are within approximately 20% of normal operating parameters.  Make adjustments as necessary and record the new settings. The operation of a device must result in burner shutdown and/or proper alarm operation.
5.	Operate burner(s) on each fuel from low fire to high fire and back to low fire in at least four increments and record combustion performance (flue gas oxygen, carbon monoxide, NOX where applicable), fuel train pressures, atomizing train pressures, burner pressures, stack temperatures, boiler steam output.
6.	Compare the combustion performance data with VAMC requirements (see below) and previous readings. If necessary, make adjustments to the fuel flow and combustion air controllers, control valves and dampers to obtain the required performance. Record the new performance data.
7.	Verify accuracy of instrumentation listed below. Verify that all devices are properly selected for the application in terms of type, size, set point range, performance, code approval. Calibrate all instruments that are not within manufacturer's specifications for accuracy.
8.	Immediately inform COR of any recommended repairs or modifications.
List of interlocks, safety devices, and gauges to be inspected, tested, or calibrated Semi Annually on each boiler/burner:
1.	Low-water cutoff (slow drain)

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975. (BRAND-NAME: ILLUMINA HiSeq 2500 SEQUENCING SYSTEM)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement</span>:</p>
<p>1. HiSeq 2500, Catalog Number: SY-401-2501, Quantity: One (1). <br />2. Shipping and Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The NHGRI/NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for our services. NISC currently have 3 HiSeq2000 sequencers in full operation and NHGRI forecast is for a significant increase over the next 6 months. Since the Sequencing Center is nearly at capacity, the Center will need an additional sequencer to meet high demand. Additionally, NISC will need capability to process certain samples very quickly, which will allow for physicians to get an appropriate turn-around time on results.</p>
<p>The HiSeq2500 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. It is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is able to run in an alternate rapid mode which would allow us to decrease our turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span>:<br /><br />&bull; HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System will be delivered within 4-6-weeks of receiving the approved contract award.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /></strong><br />The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium. <br /><br />While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. Over the past 2.5 years NISC has invested significant resources to develop a state of the art data analysis pipeline based on the Illumina family of sequencers. NISC would have to expend additional money in labor and possibly hardware to redevelop the process and integrate a new instrument. NHGRI/NISC has extensive experience with all other high-throughput sequencing platforms.</p>
<p>The HiSeq 2500 also allows researchers to process samples by a single method that is compatible with HiSeq 2000. This simplifies the NISC lab processes, minimizing labor and equipment costs, and gives researchers the flexibility to route samples to either machine type depending on the needs of the project and machine availability. The high speed of the HiSeq 2500, means that reagents sit out for a shorter period of time and decay to a lesser degree during the run. The result is longer, more accurate reads (300 vs. 200 bases). This allows NISC to expand the sequencing applications supported on this platform, as some supplications require longer reads.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements</span>:<br /><br />&bull; Must be able to run the same chemistry as HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, and Genome Analyzer IIx Systems.<br />&bull; Run time for 200 base run must be under 30 hours.<br />&bull; Data should be able to be processed through NISC's data analysis software.<br />&bull; Preparation time for samples to load on the sequencer should take about a day.<br />&bull; Read length at least 150 bp.<br />&bull; Produce paired-end reads of 60 million per run.<br />&bull; Reagents are in convenient volumes and are ready-to-load.<br />&bull; Oil is not required for the optics.<br />&bull; Straightforward protocols that require no beads or emulsions.<br />&bull; System should be able to perform amplification, sequencing and data analysis in one unit.</p>

<a href="mailto:valerie.deangelis@va.gov">valerie.deangelis@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate and award a contract to procure a Buffy Coat Aliquot Workstation for aliquoting human blood fractions with extended warranty, hardware/software maintenance/support and training from Tecan U.S., Inc., 9401 Globe Center Drive, Morrisville, NC 27560-2622 to be integrated with the same equipment previously purchased to support reproducibility of research results for a high throughput large scale genomics study.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, installation, training and maintenance for the Automated Blood Aliquoting System, a robotic Automated Liquid Handling (ALH) processing system for aliquoting human blood fractions, for the VA Medical Center Boston, MA.  Vacutainer blood tubes will be added to or input into the system. On addition of blood tubes, the system will read the bar-coded identifier on the tube and make a record of the ID. The system will include an automated decapper that will remove the caps from the blood tubes. The system will determine the locations of the blood fractions (plasma, buffy coat, red cells) within the tube with accurate precision. The robotic system will automatically remove specified volumes of each fraction and separately aliquot into specified racks of 2D bar-coded cryovials or deep well plates. The system will output separate racks of aliquots to be transferred to freezer/cryogenic storage, or other relevant lab processes such as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) extraction. The system will track sample identifiers, specimen type, aliquot volume, cryovial identifier, and sample location (rack ID and location within rack), and maintain a complete audit trail. The solicitation will be released on or about 4/28/14 on a sole source basis to Tecan U.S., Inc., the only known source of this robotic Automated Liquid Handling processing system, part number us4525-SPS for aliquoting human blood fractions. The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  The FSC/PSC is 6640.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302.1-1 Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation will be posted to this site. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contract Specialist no later than 3:00pm EST on 4/25/2014. Responses should be sent to Valerie.DeAngelis@va.gov. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of New HIV Testing Technologies in Clinical Settings with High HIV Incidence
<SOLNBR>2014-68641
<RESPDATE>050514
<CONTACT>Kim H. Morris, Phone 7704882621, Fax 7704882044, Email ycy1@cdc.gov - Theresa Routh-Murphy, Contracting Officer, Phone 7704882713, Fax 7704882044, Email tnr3@cdc.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. It is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, quotations, or an invitation for bid. The sole intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources (both small and large) for procurement planning purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) has a potential requirement to better understand the performance of available HIV tests and to use this information to update future CDC guidance on new HIV testing technologies. The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.
<p>An estimated 50,000 new HIV infections occur each year in the United States. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are estimated to have the highest incidence of new HIV infections. The first few weeks after HIV infection, referred to as the acute stage in this document, can be defined as the stage when HIV infection can be detected by testing for HIV virus directly, but there is no detectable HIV-specific antibody response. Although clinical sensitivity of tests for HIV antibodies appears to be improving, detection of HIV infection during the acute stage, by definition, requires the ability to detect virus directly rather than relying on detection of antibody. Molecular tests for HIV have traditionally been complicated and expensive to perform, and although a variety of strategies to utilize these tests in clinical settings have been proposed, they are still not widely used. Several new HIV tests have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on unprocessed specimens (e.g. fingerstick whole blood and/or oral fluid) at the point-of-care (POC), or their approval is imminent. So that CDC can monitor and update HIV testing guidance that reflects newly available testing technology and characterizes the relative performance of available tests, an evaluation must be conducted to understand the differences in sensitivity of the newest HIV serologic tests using unprocessed specimens collected from infected individuals while they are in the acute stage of disease. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the diagnostic performance of nucleic acid (molecular) tests to allow CDC to determine the applicability of this technology for use in a variety of clinical and point-of-care. In order to maximize the yield of persons identified shortly after they have been infected while limiting overall project costs, the study will be conducted in three parts.</p>
<p>The objectives of each part of the proposed project are:</p>
<p>1) To identify persons at high-risk for early infection. In Part 1, up to 50,000 persons presenting for an HIV test at study sites will be categorized as high or lower risk, based on information extracted from their medical records, or collected directly from participants through a short questionnaire. This behavioral screener which will be used on 50,000 participants seeking HIV testing will be used to identify no more than 10,000 highest risk clinic clients for selection for Part 2. <br />2) The objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the tests under study using fresh specimens collected from no more than 10,000 Part 2 participants, including a minimum of 600 HIV-infected participants and 50 participants with early infection. Part 2 of the study will involve collecting specimens for testing with the HIV testing technologies being evaluated.<br />3) The objective of Part 3 is to evaluate the seroconversion sensitivity of the new HIV tests through serial follow-up. Participants with discordant test results will undergo frequent follow-up testing to document either seroconversion on all tests being evaluated, two consecutive visits with negative test results on all tests (indicating reactive Part 2 tests were false-positive), or the completion of 70 days of follow-up. It is expected that at least 50 participants with early infection will complete Part 3 follow-up.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that contracts to no more than six (6) clinical sites (individually) or one overall contract to subcontract to six (6) sites will be awarded. In order to assess the capabilities/experience, the Offeror must have proven capabilities in the areas listed below. These areas will be the core requirements for the contemplated contract.</p>
<p>1. Does your firm serve the patient population necessary to conduct the study? Numbers below are for individual clinics, if your firm is a large business intending to subcontract, please document both prior collaborations with such clinical sites and the total numbers of clients at sites with which you would be able to subcontract (totals for the entire project are included in parentheses).</p>
<p>a. At least 2000 unduplicated patients presenting at clinic for HIV testing in the most current 12-month period preceding submission of your response (12,000/year for the total project).<br /><br />b. A minimum of 2% undiagnosed HIV prevalence (number of new HIV diagnoses/number tested) over the prior 24 months preceding submission of your response. (2% overall at all clinical sites included in the project, and with no individual site included with less than 2% prevalence of undiagnosed infection in the prior 24 months). With 2000 unduplicated patients and a 2% prevalence, a total of 40 newly diagnosed patients per year are expected. If your firm collects information on client's risk, and would meet the minimum of 40 new infections identified in a subset of 2000 or less high-risk clients this should be stated in your response. If this is the case, please describe the criteria used to subset the population to this highest risk group, and document the yield of 40 newly diagnosed infections in no more than 2000 unduplicated individual clients in this high-risk subset using data collected in the 24 months prior to your response. <br /><br />c. A minimum of 0.2% acute stage HIV infection (defined as the presence of detectable HIV virus in the absence of detectable HIV antibody) among those tested for HIV over the prior 24 months preceding submission of your response. (0.2% prevalence of detected acute infection in the prior 24 months at every site included as a subcontract). With 2000 unduplicated patients and a 0.2% prevalence of acute infection, a total of 4 newly diagnosed, acutely infected patients per year are expected. If your firm collects information on client's risk, and would meet the minimum of 4 new infections identified in the acute stage from a subset of 2000 or less high-risk clients, this should be stated in your response. If this is the case, please describe the criteria used to subset the population to this highest risk group, and document the yield of 4 newly diagnosed acute infections in no more than 2000 unduplicated individual clients in this high-risk subset using data collected in the 24 months prior to your response.</p>
<p>2. Does your firm have an onsite laboratory to conduct an evaluation of novel HIV diagnostic tests? Describe the clinic laboratory and services for HIV testing. Provide a description of onsite laboratory capacity, including any testing currently performed on site, laboratory space available for testing onsite, and onsite equipment such as number of centrifuges, freezers for storing specimens, etc. If any HIV testing is currently performed offsite, please also describe the facilities where this testing is performed or would be performed, and the processes for sending specimens out for testing and turn-around time for receipt of the results of this testing.</p>
<p>3. Does your firm have prior experience conducting clinical evaluations of diagnostic tests within your patient population? Describe current and recent laboratory research, and capacity to conduct a variety of investigational tests on unprocessed specimens at the same time and prior experience with clinical evaluations of such tests, including any experience with protocols for submission of test performance data to FDA. Also describe current and recent experience collecting, cataloguing and storing biologic specimens for future testing.</p>
<p>4. Does your firm have experience developing, implementing and managing electronic databases of patient information? Examples of the types of data to be provided include: patient demographics (race, gender, age), prior testing history (ever tested, last test time (categorized as &gt;3 years ago, 1-3 years ago, or months ago if tested in the past 12 months), and for those tested in the past 12 months (number of tests in that time period), prior HIV diagnosis, exposure to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, and risk-behavior data, as well as all test results generated from patient specimens as part of the project. Describe prior experience collecting and managing such information.</p>
<p>5. Federal government contractors must comply with strict federal and agency standards, laws and regulations for security. Detail your firms experience complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process required by the EGovernment Act of 2002.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration - Region 3 is contemplating a construction requirement in Richmond, Virginia. This is a notice for sources sought only. This is not a request for proposal nor is it a pre-solicitation communication. It is a market research effort. There is no solicitation, specification or set of drawings available for this announcement. The Government shall use the results of this market research effort to augment its decision making process with regards to setting aside this and future acquisitions for small businesses. The order of magnitude for the contemplated acquisition is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. This announcement does not constitute a procurement commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise. No contract shall be awarded from this sources sought announcement. Response is strictly voluntary. No reimbursement shall be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified information.<br />
<p><br />It is the policy of the Government to maximize practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to gain additional knowledge of interested, capable and qualified small businesses concerns of all types. Said types include small business, veteran owned small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business and women owned small business concerns. For reference, general definitions of each small business concern type can be found in FAR 52.219-8 - Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220. The applicable Size Standard is $33.5 million. A size standard, which is usually stated in number of employees or average annual receipts, represents the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may be to remain classified as a small business for SBA and federal contracting programs.</p>
<p>If your firm believes that it can meet all of the requirements for this contemplated acquisition and is a small business concern of a type described above then please respond to this sources sought announcement. Your response should be submitted via fax, email or regular mail to the attention of Mr. John C. Budesa. Contact information is as follows: FAX: 215-446-6007, Email: john.budesa@gsa.gov, Mailing address: 20 N. 8th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107.

<p>4.	Demonstrate ability to obtain a bid bond up to 20% of the maximum order of magnitude and performance and payment bonding to 100% of the maximum order of magnitude. The maximum order of magnitude is $10,000,000.00 for a single contract. This can be satisfied by obtaining your firm's bonding capability in the form of a letter from a Surety which demonstrates aggregate and per contract bonding upper limits.</p>
<p>5.	Required experience to be considered a viable source for the contemplated acquisition includes contracts awarded to your firm as the general contractor for projects which involve managing multiple subcontractors, working in historically significant, occupied buildings, dealing with sensitive customers and coordinating work involving numerous construction disciplines. Projects of such a nature must be valued in the provided order of magnitude ($5,000,000.00 - $10,000,000.00) and have been completed in the past five (5) years. Your response should address experience with building out space to fit client specifications. Your response should address experience with installing fire alarm systems to include both hardware and software requirements. Work experience in the Richmond, Virginia market and its surrounding vicinity should also be demonstrated in your response. Your response should document how it meets these requirements and must provide specific contract information to include: contract number, location, agency, dollar value (inclusive of all changes), a description of the work and a client point of contact for each award.

<p>6.	Indicate whether your firm would submit a proposal in response to an RFP consistent with these requirements that was set aside for small business concerns whether as a general small business set aside or one tailored to your firms particular concern type.</p>
<p>The Government shall carefully consider all appropriately formatted responses to this sources sought announcement in its decision making process for the contemplated acquisition. Firms that fail to provide all of the required information will not be used to augment the Government's market research efforts. Again, this is a market research effort meant to assist the Government in its acquisition decision making process and does not constitute a solicitation or award commitment.</p>

Statement of Need
VA Valet Parking Services


1.	General Intent
a.	The Phoenix VA Health Care System is anticipating parking shortage due to impending construction projects. These projects will displace approximately 200 parking spaces.
b.	The VA would like to implement a full valet parking service for Veteran patients to alleviate some of this congestion and facilitate smoother parking activity.  A variety of different methods and practices will be considered as proposed by the Offeror.  
c.	The Offeror will be required to assess the current VA parking situation, and take into consideration all provided government space and equipment as described herein.  The Offeror will provide its proposed valet parking plan, including all processes, materials, procedures, and staffing.  
d.	Upon award, the Contractor will be required to implement the proposed plan and carry it out on a day-to-day basis for the duration of the contract.  The Contractor will have thirty (30) days after this contract is awarded in which to set up operations, finalize staff requirements (including background investigations), etc. At the end of this thirty-day period, at the latest, full operations are to begin.
      2. Current Estimates
a.	The VA is prepared to set aside a portion of existing 1,700 parking spaces in a designated area for access by Contractor staff for performance of services as described herein. Offeror may acquire offsite parking areas to further increase capacity.
b.	The VA estimates that there are roughly 1,800 unique patient visits per day, some of which may choose not to use valet service. It is unknown how fast of a turnover each car will have that will employ this Valet Service.  Some patients are at the hospital for multiple appointments, which can result in the car spending the day in one Valet parking spot. The contract is based on the ability to fit 200 cars in parking area, while continuing operations of new drop-offs and returns.
c.	Busiest times at the PVAHCS are weekdays with Fridays generally the least busy.  Weekdays are usually busiest from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM.

Contract services are to be provided Monday - Friday (excluding holidays) from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. The Offeror may propose different hours if they will provide value to PVAHCS.  Contract staff may arrive earlier and stay later as necessary to set up or break down equipment, signage, etc.  A designated Contract Supervisor (further defined herein) must be on-site during any performance under this contract.  The PVAHCS reserves the right to adjust these hours/location and other changes that are deemed necessary once the demand has been more clearly identified.










The Government is not obligated to nor will it pay for or reimburse any costs associated with responding to this sources sought request.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The Government will in no way be bound to this information if any solicitation is issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 812930.  All offerors who provide goods or services to the U.S. Federal Government must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) located on the web at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation at the WPAFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334510. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is St Jude Medical, Inc., One St. Jude Medical Drive , St. Paul, MN 55117-9983. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within four (4) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation on 1 May 2014 to be performed at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB). The patient has had multiple spinal surgeries with no change in pain level. The patient has also failed all other methods of conservative treatment for pain moderation besides the IPG Stimulator. The IPG Stimulator will reduce pain in the patient whereas all other treatments could not. The Neuro surgeon has trained using the St. Jude IPG Stimulator and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th MSG/SC, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-05-D-0001 which expires on 15 September 2014. The bridge contract will consist of a one (1) year basic period of performance with a six (6) month option extension. The AFNWC/PZIB intends to make an award to Abacus Technology Corporation, 5454 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1100, Chevy Chase MD 20815. Interested parties may e-mail brian.clark.6@us.af.mil, not later than 2 May 2014, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which will be considered by the government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award to a new contractor for a bridge contract would impact KAFB's schedules due to the ramp-up time required by a new contractor to support a short period of C4 services. A bridge contract must be executed to ensure that mission critical C4 support remains in place to sustain Kirtland Air Force Base's mission and the various missions of its mission partners. Loss of contract C4 support would have a catastrophic impact on AFNWC and all Kirtland AFB organizations resulting in mission failure and potential negative impacts across the Air Force.</p>
<p>There is only one (1) contractor (Abacus Technology Corporation) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

This equipment provides display and control functions for aircraft that do not have the CMWS connected to that aircraft avionics bus. The TWI is a single line replaceable unit comprising of digital interfaces, operator controls and display processor. It is Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) B compatible and has a high resolution and color active matrix liquid crystal display. <br>  <br> The capability which the TWI provides is essential to the Software Engineering Directorate, Aviation Missile Research and Development Center (AMRDEC) analysis of software systems. <br>  <br> AUTHORITY CITED- The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br>  <br> REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED- The TWI is designed and manufactured by Meggitt Avionics and is not sold by another vendor or distributor. The capability which the TWI provides is essential to the SED, AMRDEC analysis of software systems.  <br>  <br> Any parties that feel they can meet this requirement should contact MAJ Patrick Schanley via email at Patrick.m.schanley.mil@mail.mil  NO LATER THAN April 22, 2014 at 5:00 PM (CST).

<DESC>&nbsp;SoSITE&nbsp;INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office will host an Industry Day in support of DARPA's System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program on 9 May 2014 at the DARPA Conference Center, 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA from 0800 to 1200. Check-in begins at 0700. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the SoSITE program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions about the program, and facilitate one-on-one meetings between proposers and the DARPA program manager.<br /><br />PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:<br />The System of Systems (SoS) Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program will develop SoS architectures for air superiority in contested environments, demonstrate the rapid integration of mission systems into architectures, and demonstrate the combat effectiveness and robustness of those architectures.<br />The objective of the SoSITE program is to demonstrate that a SoS approach can provide increased military effectiveness, cost leverage (i.e., the cost of the opponent to counter relative to the cost of the US to deploy), and adaptability necessary to maintain US air superiority in contested environments. This Industry Day covers Phase 1 of the SoSITE program only. The objective of Phase 1 is to develop architectures for distributing functionality across networks of manned and unmanned platforms for future experimentation, and to develop tools to enable this distribution to be done quickly and reliably. The objective of Phase 2, potentially following the release of a second BAA, is to resolve risks through experiments.<br /><br />Phase 1 of the SoSITE program seeks innovative research proposals in two major technical areas (TAs):<br /><br />TA1 - Architecture Development and Analysis.<br />TA2 - Integration Technology Development.<br /><br />The SoSITE program will be conducted at several security levels. The Government anticipates that TA1 performers will produce products at the unclassified, collateral SECRET level, and TOP SECRET Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Required (SAR) levels. The Government anticipates that TA2 performers will produce products at the unclassified and collateral SECRET levels.<br /><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register no later than close of business on 5 May 2014, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:DARPA-SN-14-35@DARPA.MIL">DARPA-SN-14-35@DARPA.MIL</a> with "SoSITE Industry Day Registration" in the subject line. The email should include the attendee's first and last name, organization, country of citizenship, email address, and telephone number. A reply email confirming the registration will be sent. Concurrently, the participant should ensure that they have a current visitor request at the collateral SECRET level or higher on file at DARPA in accordance with procedures on the DARPA web site: (http://www.darpa.mil/About/Contact/Visitor_Guidelines.aspx).<br /><br />Participants may request a meeting with the SoSITE program manager by sending an email to <a href="mailto:DARPA-SN-14-35@DARPA.MIL">DARPA-SN-14-35@DARPA.MIL</a> with "PM Meeting" in the subject line. The email should<br />include the attendee's name, organization, email address, and telephone number. A reply email confirming the registration will be sent. Meetings times will be emailed to participants prior to the beginning of the Industry Day. DARPA anticipates that meeting duration will be 15 minutes.<br /><br />There is no registration fee for attending this conference.<br /><br />The Industry Day will be held at the collateral SECRET level, is open to U.S. citizens only, and will not be open to the general public.<br />Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 160 registrants, and no more than three (3) representatives per organization. Companies should coordinate their attendees' participation. Organizations interested in responding to Technical Area 1 should include a Contractor Program Security Officer as one of their three attendees<br /><br />All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.<br /><br />The Industry Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Industry Day.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER F13PS00454 Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement
SYNOPSIS:  Integrated Waterbird Management Monitoring Initiative Database 
NOTICE: THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT AN RFQ.  The intent of this notice is to inform the vendor community of USFWS's proposed contract action. This proposed procurement is for items which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(b)(1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than April 24, 2014, 1 pm CST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. 
The US Fish & Wildlife Service intends to award a sole source contract to Point Reyes Bird Observatory dba: Point Blue Conservation Science, based on FAR 6.302.1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The purpose of this procurement is to create a centralized, online Integrated Waterbird Management Monitoring Initiative Database.  Currently, the Integrated Waterbird Management and Monitoring Program (IWMM) uses non-federated copies of an Access database to store and manage waterbird and habitat data from across two flyways.  This approach created data entry and management inefficiencies for IWMM staff and participants and limits the ability of participants and partners to access data, reports, and decision support tools in a timely fashion.  To grow and improve, IWMM needs a centralized, online database that will address deficiencies of the current database model.
The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of $14.0m dollars. 
All questions and/or responses must be directed to Jeanne Mohlis via email at jeanne_mohlis@fws.gov. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC><p>The Maritime Administration (MARAD) will be hosting&nbsp;Industry Day for the 2015 Acquisition for Ship Management Services on May 9, 2014 9:00 AM-12:00 PM. This event will be held at the Department of Transportation Headquarters at 1200New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20590. The purpose of this Industry Day is to gain and provide insight on the structure of the upcoming solicitation. We want to hear from you how we can improve our program and ensure its viability for both government and industry. MARAD is seeking industry and stakeholder input in the development of the 2015 solicitation. We have developed some key questions to start the conversation:<br /><br />Is the level of risk ship managers assume appropriate? What can we reduce risk for ship managers?</p>
<p>How can we make the ship manager performance requirements more commercial-like?</p>
<p>What is an optimal base contract performance period that best balances risk/cost/performance? What performance Options?</p>
<p>What performance metrics should MARAD be using that it's not?</p>
<p>What performance metrics are using MARAD that are ineffective?</p>
<p>How will prospective reductions of six or more vessels from the RRF impact the industry?</p>
<p>Given the prospective budgetary constraints in the next 2-5 years and beyond, what is the optimal ROS crew size/mix MARAD should consider while still meeting readiness requirements?</p>
<p>What requirements in our ship manager contracts can be revised to decrease costs while still maintaining 5-day readiness?</p>
<p>For what reasons is the ship management industrial pool is dwindling? Or, is there something about our program that limits the pool and/or prohibits participation or maintenance of viable ship management companies?</p>
<p>How can we encourage more creative ideas from new and fresh contractors?</p>
<p>We will also address any additional questions. Attendees are encouraged to submit written questions in advance to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Sabrina Phillips at Sabrina.Phillips@dot.gov.</p>
<p>Registration: <br />Attendees must RSVP via e-mail to Ms. Sabrina Phillips at Sabrina.Phillips@dot.gov no later than 5:00 PM EST on May 5, 2014. Participation is limited to no more than three (3) representatives per company. The RSVP must include the following information:</p>
<p>Name <br />Title<br />Company Name<br />Contact E-mail<br /><br />This Industry Day is solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The information provided is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of any costs incurred to participate.

<p><br />This is a notice of intent to issue a sole source modification to Contract DG1332-12-CQ-0052, Kaymont Consolidated Industries Inc., to increase the maximum contract quantity for item 0001 General Purpose, 26KM Balloons (ASN: J352-4), hereafter referred to as GP-26, by 39,000 from 140,000 to 179,000.  The modification will be issued pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>On June 29, 2012, NOAA issued solicitation DG133W-12-RP-0101 for up to 140,000 General Purpose 26 km (GP-26) Aerological Sounding Balloons to support the NWS upper air network.  Three vendors responded to the solicitation; Kaymont Consolidated Industries Inc. (Kaymont) of Hauppage, NY (Kaymont) Space Data Corporation of Chandler, AZ (Space Data) and NJ Balloon Manufacturing, LLC of Montclair, NJ (NJ Balloon).   Contracts were awarded to each of the vendors for GP-26 balloons on September 17, 2012.  Delivery Orders were awarded to each awardee for First Article Test units.</p>
<p>First Article Test was waived for Kaymont's GP-26 balloon since it had already delivered balloons that met NWS requirements.  First article tests were conducted on both Space Data and NJ Balloons GP-26 balloons.  Neither company has passed first article testing.  Kaymont was able to produce and deliver GP-26 balloons at a rate that meets the NWS 6,500 per month usage rate and 75-day lead time.   Kaymont is the only responsible source that can meet NWS's urgent need for GP-26 balloons.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be provided within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing a narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 11:00 am EST, April 28, 2014.  The responses must be submitted via e-mail to Catherine Perren, Contract Specialist, at catherine.a.perren@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Edgeone, LLC, 4 Little Brook Road, West Wareham, MA 02576, for the following requirement: The requirement is intended to provide ten (10) Model 8242XS acoustic release and transponder with welded alkaline battery pack with shipping, for NOAA, National Data Buoy Center, Building 3203 Stennis Space Center, MS 39529. Solicitation number is 14-01837.<br /><br />Time of delivery is thirty (30) days after receipt of order. Deliver to NOAA, National Data Buoy Center, Building 3203 Stennis Space Center, MS 39529. In order to comply with the debt collection act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Authority: 41 USC 253(c) (1). The Product Service Code (PSC) for this is 6605. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 which has a corresponding size standard of 750 employees. <br /><br />The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement using FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition procedures current through FAC 2005-72.<br /><br />The NDBC uses EdgeTech acoustic releases (models 8242 &amp; 8242XS) that are used between the TAO and DART programs. The advantage to have a single type of release used over every program is the spares can be shared across programs, only one type of deck control set is required, and the technicians only require training on one unit. Hence, this increases reliability and reduces costs to the NDBC. <br /><br />There are other manufacturers of the acoustic releases that require their specific deck set to program and activate them. The NDBC already has an inventory of EdgeTech deck sets so no further costs is required to purchase additional deck sets. Further, any new model of acoustic release would have to go through laboratory and field testing before it was commissioned for operational use due to the potential loss of equipment with the failure of one release. The operational commissioning can take a minimum of one year and become costly. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.301(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>&lsquo;UNDERSTANDING THE DEFENSE CONTRACT AUDIT AGENCY (DCAA) PROCESS WORKSHOP SERIES' - DCAA Overview, Accounting System &amp; Incurred Cost Requirements
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), and DCAA Office of Audit Liaison have teamed together to host a series of workshops to assist Washington D.C. Metro Area Small Businesses. These workshops are designed to assist Small Businesses in different financial aspects of government contracting.</p>
<p>ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP</p>
<p>ONR awards primarily cost-type contracts for the preponderance of its requirements due to the absence of precise specifications and difficulties in estimating costs in some of its Research and Development efforts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 16.301-3(a)(3) states that a cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract; firms that do not have an accounting system determined to be adequate may jeopardize their ability to receive a contract.</p>
<p>The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon a review performed by the DCAA. Specific information concerning assessing adequacy of a contractor's accounting system may be found at DCAA's website: http://www.dcaa.mil. Please note, only the Government may request a formal DCAA accounting system review.</p>
<p>These workshops will provide targeted information to vendors within the Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia commuting area to assist with audit issues that relate to the Small Business community. For those Small Businesses outside the local Washington D.C. commuting area please contact Ms. Sherry Kobus, DCAA Small Business Program Manager at (703) 767-2271 or Sherry.Kobus@DCAA.Mil for dates and times when the presentations will be made available in your area.</p>
<p>The first &lsquo;Workshop' will have the following presentations:</p>
<p>1. An Overview of DCAA <br />2. Accounting System Requirements; and <br />3. Incurred Cost Submissions.</p>
<p>COST: &lsquo;FREE'; $0.00</p>

<DESC>The New York District Army Corps of Engineers proposes to perform maintenance dredging of the Shrewsbury River, New Jersey, Federal Navigation Project with subsequent beach placement.  The project consists of performing maintenance dredging of the Federal Navigation channel in the Shrewsbury River (turning basin), with subsequent placement of the dredged material on Monmouth Beach in Monmouth County, NJ.  The designated placement area on the ocean side beach would be located approximately 2.8 miles south of the proposed bayside dredging area at its furthest point.  Placement would involve hydraulically pumping the dredged material (96% or greater sand and gravel) via pipeline that runs across the peninsula at Seacrest Road from the bay side, under Route 36 by means of directional drilling, over the seawall and directly onto Monmouth Beach.  <br>  <br> The proposed maintenance dredging and beach placement would require dredging of up to approximately 54,000 cubic yards of material from the Shrewsbury River turning basin. The project would be dredged to a depth of 9 feet below MLW plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. The proposed work can be performed by a hydraulic dredge or similar plant. <br>  <br> The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt of Contractor's signature of the Notice to Proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the work ready for use not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt of Contractor's signature of the Notice to Proceed. The work would include obtaining the necessary permits from the NJDOT for the pipeline crossing beneath Route 36 at Seacrest Road. The contractor is required to maintain a production rate of at least 2,000 cubic yards per calendar day. There are no options to the contract.  <br>  <br> This solicitation is subject to FAR Part 14 sealed bidding procedures and is 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  All bids must be received on time to be considered. The IFB will be evaluated based on price with award being made to the lowest responsible bidder. The applicable NAICS Code is 237990 and the small business standard size is $25.5 million. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of September 2014 to November 2014. The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 1 May 2014 with bid opening on/about 2 June 2014. <br>  <br> Liquidated Damages - $2,151.00 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract is accepted. <br>  <br> The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued.

Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:

To ensure actual control over the enterprise, the individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the enterprise conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:
(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation;
(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
(b) General.

(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);
(4) A description of how subcontractors (if any) will be selected in compliance with the Indian Preference or Indian Preference Program clause(s);

(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.
(2) If a contractor no longer meets the definition of an Indian economic enterprise after award, the contractor must notify the CO in writing. The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the standardization of Specimen Containers. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) ME-1202-28_Specimen_Containers are eligible for participation. MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Specimen Containers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL ME-1202-28_Specimen_Containers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL ME-1202-28_Specimen_Containers, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA</strong>. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $482,024.52 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL ME-1202-28_Specimen_Containers who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Europe via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Specimen Containers pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification.<strong> Vendors not currently on the QSL for Specimen Containers will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO ME-1202-28_Specimen_Containers.</strong> Vendor must provide responses to the Sources Sought Notification via the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the standardization of Specimen Containers Peel Pack. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) ME-1310-01_Specimen_Containers_Peel_Pack are eligible for participation. MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Specimen Containers Peel Pack products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL ME-1310-01_Specimen_Containers_Peel_Pack. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is May 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL ME-1310-01_Specimen_Containers_Peel_Pack, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers Peel Pack.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers Peel Pack. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $250,939.28 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL ME-1310-01_Specimen_Containers_Peel_Pack who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Europe via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</span></strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization.<strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS.</strong> The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>Specimen Containers Peel Pack pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification.<strong> Vendors not currently on the QSL for Specimen Containers Peel Pack will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO ME-1310-01_Specimen_Containers_Peel_Pack.</strong> Vendor must provide responses to the Sources Sought Notification via the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>

Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions / Annual Usage in Units&nbsp; / (Eaches)<br />Specimen container, 4 - 5oz (120-150ml), sterile packaging allowing delivery to a sterile field, with screw lid/cap, label, maximum unit of sale (UOS) 300 containers per case / 828,100</p>
<p>2. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>

<p>Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The New York District Army Corps of Engineers proposes to perform maintenance dredging of the Shrewsbury River, New Jersey, Federal Navigation Project with subsequent beach placement.  The project consists of performing maintenance dredging of the Federal Navigation channel in the Shrewsbury River (turning basin), with subsequent placement of the dredged material on Monmouth Beach in Monmouth County, NJ.  The designated placement area on the ocean side beach would be located approximately 2.8 miles south of the proposed bayside dredging area at its furthest point.  Placement would involve hydraulically pumping the dredged material (96% or greater sand and gravel) via pipeline that runs across the peninsula at Seacrest Road from the bay side, under Route 36 by means of directional drilling, over the seawall and directly onto Monmouth Beach.  <br>  <br> The proposed maintenance dredging and beach placement would require dredging of up to approximately 54,000 cubic yards of material from the Shrewsbury River turning basin. The project would be dredged to a depth of 9 feet below MLW plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. The proposed work can be performed by a hydraulic dredge or similar plant. <br>  <br> The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt of Contractor's signature of the Notice to Proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the work ready for use not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt of Contractor's signature of the Notice to Proceed. The work would include obtaining the necessary permits from the NJDOT for the pipeline crossing beneath Route 36 at Seacrest Road. The contractor is required to maintain a production rate of at least 2,000 cubic yards per calendar day. There are no options to the contract.  <br>  <br> This solicitation is subject to FAR Part 14 sealed bidding procedures and is 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  All bids must be received on time to be considered. The IFB will be evaluated based on price with award being made to the lowest responsible bidder. The applicable NAICS Code is 237990 and the small business standard size is $25.5 million. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of September 2014 to November 2014. The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 1 May 2014 with bid opening on/about 2 June 2014. <br>  <br> Liquidated Damages - $2,151.00 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract is accepted. <br>  <br> The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7007, all vendors who want access to the solicitation must be registered with System for Award Management (SAM), located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/  and Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps), located at http://www.fbo.gov, in order to safeguard acquisition-related information for all Federal Agencies.

<p>(a) Determination.

The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting, if applicable, will be specified on each task order.<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation.

If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />(End of clause)<br />HSAR 3052.215-70, KEY PERSONNEL OR FACILITIES (DEC 2003)<br />(a) The personnel or facilities specified below are considered essential to the work being performed under this contract and may, with the consent of the contracting parties, be changed from time to time during the course of the contract by adding or deleting personnel or facilities, as appropriate.<br />(b) Before removing or replacing any of the specified individuals or facilities, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, before the change becomes effective.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair or overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-14-Q-100099 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair or overhaul vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component OEM, a capable repair or overhaul vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore, to be considered, must be deemed a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair or overhaul as applicable, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility and no other facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future award consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable.

The component OEM was originally California Microwave Systems but is now Telephonics Corporation, Cage Code 06QS4. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This is AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(3) 52.232-40 - PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (Dec 2013) <br />As prescribed in 32.009-2, insert the following clause:<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<br />(End of clause)<br />(4) FAR 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

The solicitation document, incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72, effective 30 Jan 2014.

<p>This is an amendment to the solicitation. The quantity has changed for Liebert UPS from 13 to 12 and the period of performance has changed in Paragraph 3.1. The NACIS Code has changed to 811219. Please delete the previous PWS and use the attached one instead.</p>
<p>Also, listed below are responses to questions from offerors.</p>
<p>1. If you reconsider this being a sole source, please let us know. We are able to provide technicans who have experience on Liebert equipment.<br />Response: We would love to remove this as a sole source; however, unless we get Liebert certified (current) maintenance technicians, our warranties will be invalid. <br />2. We are a small business and are required to do 50% of the labor in order to qualify for this requirement. Is that true?<br />Response: Small businesses are required to do 50% or more of the required contract (the cost of equipment is included in this).<br />3. The RFP indicates that there are 13 UPS in the CLIN structure; however, we counted 12 UPS in the PWS. Which one is correct?<br />Response: There are 12 UPS located at JWAC. We will correct the RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Removed the requirement for a Small Business set-aside since Small businesses are unable to perform 50% or more of the work.</p>

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or Native as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:
(i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe. To ensure actual control over the enterprise, the individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the enterprise conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:
(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation;
(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
(b) General.
(1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers are solicited only from Indian economic enterprises.
(2) BIA will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises.
(3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause.

(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);
(4) A description of how subcontractors (if any) will be selected in compliance with the Indian Preference or Indian Preference Program clause(s);

(6) Qualifications of the key personnel (if any) that will be assigned to the contract; and
(7) A description of method(s) for compliance with any supplemental Tribal employment preference requirements, if contained in this solicitation.
(d) Required Assurance. The offeror must provide written assurance to the Indian Affairs that it will comply, or has, complied fully with the requirements of this clause. It must do this before Indian Affairs awards the Buy Indian contract, and upon successful and timely completion of the contract, but before the Indian Affairs Contracting Officer (CO) accepts the work or product.
(e) Non-responsiveness. Failure to provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause may cause Indian Affairs to find an offer non-responsive and to reject it.
(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.
(2) If a contractor no longer meets the definition of an Indian economic enterprise after award, the contractor must notify the CO in writing. The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.

<p>V. EVALUATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Evaluation Criteria -</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal and effectiveness in training graduate students in the field of mine-ventilation engineering; (45 points)<br />&bull; The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator, if applicable, based on the criteria specified in the QUALIFICATIONS portion of this solicitation-special consideration will be given to Principal Investigators that tenured or in tenure track faculty positions in the area of mine ventilation; (25 points)<br />&bull; Number of proposed graduate students with respect to requested funding; (20 points)<br />&bull; The proposed budgetary costs to complete all elements of the proposed work are realistic. (10 points).</p>
<p>Past Performance - As required by FAR 15.305, past performance will be evaluated as part of the contract award process. The Government intends to perform a past performance evaluation only on those Offerors who have been recommended for award. This evaluation may require some additional relevant performance information from the Offeror if it is not readily available from prior submissions.</p>
<p>Industry-Academia Partnering - NIOSH highly encourages partnering among industry and academia with a view toward speeding the incorporation of new science and technology into practice.</p>
<p>2. Evaluation Panel -</p>
<p>Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-5 and 15.207. The program officer and other Government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Government business professionals will evaluate cost proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants. Similarly, support contractors may be utilized to evaluate cost proposals. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor's employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Reporting -</p>
<p>&bull; A detailed annual Contract Status Report for each year of the project.<br />&bull; Make an annual research status presentation at either the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration Annual Meeting or Bi-Annual Ventilation Conference, (locations near or at the venues for these presentations will be determined by NISOH). Note presentations will be as follows: 10-minute overview presentation by the sponsoring professor, followed by a 20-minute technical presentation by one or more of the students involved in the contracted effort.<br />&bull; A detailed final report that summarizes the work and results for the entire project.<br />However, please note that specific additional deliverables (which may include software and hardware deliverables) may be proposed by each offeror and finalized during negotiations.</p>
<p>2. Continuation of Funding -</p>
<p>NIOSH will review contract performance annually prior to the continuation of funding for the following year.<br /><br />VII. OTHER INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Government Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Facilities</p>
<p>Each proposer must provide a very specific description of any equipment/hardware that it needs to acquire to perform the work. This description should indicate whether or not each particular piece of equipment/hardware will be included as part of a deliverable item under the resulting award. Also, this description should identify the component, nomenclature, and configuration of the equipment/hardware that it proposes to purchase for this effort. It is the government's desire to have the contractor purchase the equipment/hardware for deliverable items under their contract. The purchase on a direct reimbursement basis of special test equipment or other equipment that is not included in a deliverable item will be evaluated for allowability on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Government research facilities may be available and could potentially be considered government furnished equipment/facilities. These facilities and resources are of high value and some are in constant demand by multiple programs. The use of these facilities and resources will be negotiated as the program unfolds. Offerors should not assume that government owned facilities, including the Safety Research Coal Mine, or the Experimental Mine, are available for research ideas submitted under this announcement. If these facilities are essential to the research proposal, the Offeror needs to clearly identify the reasons for using these facilities. If the facilities are not available during the proposed time frame for the research described in the Proposal and there are no other field site options listed, the Proposal will be rejected.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to provide responses to vendors' questions.&nbsp; Please see the questions and responses below:<br /><br />1. Is there an incumbent contractor currently performing this work?  If so, could you please provide the contract number for this opportunity?  If not, who is doing the work included in this proposal now?
<p>This works is currently being performed by the LAC Group under Purchase Order LCLAW14P0004.</p>
<p>2. Is the requirement for specific Law Library experience essential?</p>
<p>Experience specific to the Law Library is not essential.  It would, however, be very helpful to have some familiarity with the ongoing and planned projects consuming Law Library funds; the systems used to evaluate the status of Law Library budget execution; and the modules inherent in gauging the impacts of projected adjustments to the Law Library payroll.</p>
<p>3. The RFP says to submit through FBO, to the best of my knowledge there is not a mechanism for a response through FBO.  May it be submitted directly by email?</p>
<p>The posting on FBO has been updated so that electronic submissions directly through FBO are enabled.</p>
<p>4. How was the estimate for total effort determined?</p>
<p>This was based on historical data gathered during previous iterations of this requirement.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>DTAR1052.232-7003 Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements for the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (Aug 2012)<br />The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Managements Internet Payment Platform (IPP) is a government-wide electronic payment information service that replaces the Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system. IPP allows vendors to receive their remittance information from their financial institution. Effective October 31, 2008, IPP replaced the PAID system. Former PAID users have been automatically migrated to IPP and need to complete the initial provisioning process from the new user ID, temporary password, and web address sent by Treasury. This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.<br />The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download. Payment information will be uploaded to the IPP daily from Treasury systems on the date of payment.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p>DTAR1052.210-70 CONTRACTOR PUBLICITY (AUG 2011)<br />The Contractor, or any entity or representative acting on behalf of the Contractor, shall not refer to the equipment or services furnished pursuant to the provisions of this contract in any news release or commercial advertising, or in connection with any news release or commercial advertising, without first obtaining explicit written consent to do so from the Contracting Officer. Should any reference to such equipment or services appear in any news release or commercial advertising issued by or on behalf of the Contractor without the required consent, the Government shall consider institution of all remedies available under applicable law, including 31 U.S.C. 333, and this contract. Further, any violation of this provision may be considered during the evaluation of past performance in future competitively negotiated acquisitions.</p>
<p>DTAR1052.232-7003 Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements for the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (Aug 2012)<br />The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Managements Internet Payment Platform (IPP) is a government-wide electronic payment information service that replaces the Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system. IPP allows vendors to receive their remittance information from their financial institution. Effective October 31, 2008, IPP replaced the PAID system. Former PAID users have been automatically migrated to IPP and need to complete the initial provisioning process from the new user ID, temporary password, and web address sent by Treasury. This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.<br />The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download. Payment information will be uploaded to the IPP daily from Treasury systems on the date of payment.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

For other than firm fixed price subcontractors, subcontractors are also required to provide labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of ODCs, materials, and travel invoiced. Supporting documentation may be encrypted before submission to the prime contractor for WAWF invoice submittal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 16 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A successful political, security, and economic transition in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities. USAID/OTI is supporting this goal through implementation of a small grants program that aims to strengthen community capacities to support a peaceful political transition, to support peaceful electoral processes and outcomes, and to mitigate the impact of violence on peace and stability.</p>
<p>OTI implements clusters of community-focused small grants through a process-oriented approach with Afghan ownership of decisions and results. In OTI's programming, the project processes are as important as project outputs in contributing to the program's strategic goal of stabilization. The program utilizes both "soft" (e.g., community cohesion jirgas, outreach visits by district government; cultural and recreational activities) and "hard" (e.g., small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between vulnerable communities and positive community resiliencies and customary leadership, increasing community cohesion in the process. The program also supports national level activities in support of peaceful elections.</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, and is based in Afghanistan as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>Due to the changing nature of US Government presence in Afghanistan, after mid-2015, the position may require the contractor to work outside the country.  The incumbent would need to be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Afghanistan region. The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods of time, and would receive applicable allowances at the rate in effect at the destination post at the time of travel.  The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Afghanistan region.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Afghanistan country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other bilateral donors, international organizations, and local government officials.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p><br />9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, strong analytical and organizational skills, the exercise of good judgment, discretion and personal responsibility, and ability to communicate with a variety of interlocutors.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting his/her supervisor in responding to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT

HUMAN FACTORS' R&D SERVICES FOR IMPROVED ROTORCRAFT OPERATIONAL SAFETY

1.  Introduction/Purpose

The FAA has a requirement for human factors research and development (R&D) services.  The requirement is to develop scientific and technical information that will support recommendations for regulatory guidance that are intended to improve rotorcraft operational safety.  

Although no funding has yet been programmed for this area of safety-critical human factors scientific effort, we are planning a significant, multi-year program of research and development to address current and emerging human factors challenges to rotorcraft operational safety.  Initially, there are six identified focus areas for this R&D program to characterize and address human factors issues in rotorcraft technologies and procedures, including:

a.  NVIS (NVG) Operations. Data is needed to address night vision goggle (NVG) single crew operations into unimproved landing zones.  The data will inform decisions for minimum crew and type of operation, including cognitive task and information needs analysis relative to visual cueing with and without NVG, considering no landing zone (LZ) preparation.  A human factors cognitive task analysis and subsequent simulation research would be used to obtain the needed data.  Mandating use of NVG at night in all environments might create human factors safety concerns.  Additional R&D will address these considerations.

b.  Inflight Weather Decision Making. In order to mitigate continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) during HEMS operations, there is a need for human factors R&D to develop procedures and tools to assist the flight crew in airborne weather assessment and decision making.  This is a priority safety initiative to reduce HEMS controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) and wirestrike events in deteriorating weather.  The R&D goal is to provide authoritative guidance to HEMS crews through decision support and training.  This will mitigate mission pressures to continue VFR flight during adverse weather. The current web-based aviation digital data service (ADDS) HEMS tool addresses preflight planning considerations, but does not mitigate problems related to continuing VFR flight into adverse weather after the mission has launched.  One approach under consideration would ask a joint government (FAA-NASA) and industry team to characterize the flight crew information needs, and then to develop recommendations for follow-on research.  The research would develop and evaluate mitigations including airborne tools (e.g., iPAD applications), displays, operating heuristics, and associated training to reduce the incidence of airborne weather decision making errors.  

c.  Fuel Mismanagement. Fuel mismanagement human factors issues may account for increased accidents. A research assessment of these accidents will identify the nature and scope of the problem and lead to recommendations for research to develop appropriate mitigations.

d.  Runway Safety and Runway Incursion Mitigation. Research is needed to develop guidance for 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 91 and 135 helicopter operators and regulatory oversight personnel. The guidance will implement operating procedures and emphasize pilot actions to maintain awareness during taxi operations, reducing the incidence of runway incursions.  Unique issues are related to rotorcraft operations in the airport environment.  Land pad locations, with or without taxiway access, landing pad safety areas, landing on taxiways, non-standard approaches to landing areas, hover and air taxi operations, and visibility of signage and markings are areas of concern.  In FY12, a Category A runway incursion occurred at White Plains, NY (HPN) due to a rotorcraft, and several Category C events involving rotorcraft have also been reported.  A study of runway incursion event data would identify common causal factors related to rotorcraft operations in and around runway and landing pad safety areas.  Recommendations would be formulated for potential mitigations to lower the risk of rotorcraft runway incursions and accidents.  

e.  Single Pilot Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Operations.  Single pilot helicopters conducting RNP operations may exceed pilot workload (minimum crew / type of operation) and safe operating practices.  A simulation study would provide data that would identify the potential need for operating limitations and mitigations for excessive workload in single pilot RNP operations.

f.  Human Factors Aspects of Improved Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Airways in Metroplex and Other Congested Areas.  Improved IFR airway structure in specific regions of the National Airspace System is a priority of the Vertical Flight Committee (VFC).  This will improve safety of IFR operations in high density helicopter operations areas, and will separate these operations from other commercial operations in metroplex areas.  The development of improved IFR infrastructure will improve operational safety in EMS and other commercial helicopter operations.  Additionally, this infrastructure will also help to provide separation of helicopter operations from eventual unmanned aircraft operations in these congested areas.  Human factors research will facilitate development of this improved infrastructure.

Note that the focus areas for the R&D program are subject to the needs of the FAAs regulatory policy organizations.  Therefore, the scope and emphasis areas may vary substantially from the time of this announcement until issuance of a formal solicitation and negotiation of an award, expected early in fiscal year 2015.

2. Acquisition Landscape, Strategy, and Size

There is currently no incumbent contractor for this procurement.  The FAA welcomes market survey information from all potential offerors.
 
3. Nature of Competition

The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time.   The FAA may choose to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards, and these could include various types of agreements such as Cooperative Agreements, Other Transaction Agreements, and contract awards, through either an unrestricted competition or a set-aside.  The particular acquisition strategy to be used for the procurement will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey.

Based on initial funding and technical requirement estimates, we anticipate projects of one year duration, with options for up to three subsequent one-year awards without further competition.  In the past, agreements of this nature have included year-long R&D efforts with award values in the $200,000 to $300,000 range.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract action to The Boeing Company (Boeing), 5301 Bolsa Ave, Huntington Beach, CA 92647, for 25 EADR Flash Drive Receiver Assemblies in support of the P-8A aircraft. The EADR acoustic flash drive receiver assembly is incorporated into the Boeing EADR chassis. The receiver assembly mates with the EADR Removable Drive Assembly creating the unique input/output interface to format and load the media within the Removable Drive Assembly for operational use on the P-8A aircraft; this interface will be established independently of the interface between the Removable Drive Assembly and the EADR Chassis for pre- and post mission tasks. In addition, NAVAIR intends to procure 25 dual Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) connector assemblies to be used to upgrade previously procured acoustics flash drive receivers. The planned delivery dates are 7 EADR acoustic flash drive receiver assemblies by September 2014 with the remainder along with the connector assemblies by December 2014. This sole source contract action is in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. Any interested party must have the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort within schedule requirements. Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate respondent's ability to perform to the Government's needs within the required response time. This synopsis is for informational purposes only.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />Requirement Owner: Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Point Mugu, CA<br />Purpose of Sources Sought Technical Description: NAWCWD intends to award a sole source contract to ComGlobal Systems, Inc. for engineering services in support of Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and systems engineering activities related to Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Programs at Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF). The purpose of this sources sought is to determine if there are other companies capable of providing the required services in a competitive procurement. <br />Anticipated Timeframe: <br />Estimated RFP release: July 2014<br />Estimated Award: November 2014<br />Estimated Period of Performance: November 2014 through November 2019<br />Places of Performance:
<p>Approximately 90% of the total effort will be performed at PMRF, HI. 90% of that work will be completed at the Government site and the remaining 10% will be completed off-site. 10% of the total effort will be performed at Point Mugu, CA with the same breakdown of 90% of the work taking place on Government sites and 10% taking place offsite.<br />DISCLAIMER: THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUESET FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.<br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br />This requirement is for engineering services to be provided in support of Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and systems engineering activities related to Aegis BMD and Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Programs at PMRF. Aegis BMD is one weapon system in the layered defense provided for the United States and its deployed forces, friends and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. This defense is provided through an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), developed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). MDA is responsible for fulfilling the goals set out in the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 in deploying "as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack". In support of this goal the Aegis BMD program needs to conduct long-range missile intercept testing in the Pacific. To ensure an acceptable level of range safety during the tests, the MDA requires adequate situation awareness over a wide enough area to support tests with ballistic missiles. Radar surveillance systems currently in use at the various missile-testing sites are inadequate to conduct range safety surveillance over such a large area. <br />This is a follow-on contract to N68936-12-C-0109. The existing contract is a CPFF type contract awarded to ComGlobal Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis. Any previous/existing contract information is available at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>Aegis BMD Flight Test Missions conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility requires real time operational support for maritime situational awareness during scheduled test periods. The PMRF Range Safety Officer requires critical surveillance information in order to conduct these missions safely. A system utilizing validated, tested software and analysis algorithms is needed to meet this requirement. The system must provide features tailored for existing range surveillance requirements and be customizable to add new range safety capabilities as described below.</p>
<p>The system shall successfully validate software and algorithms to receive, read, and process contact report data from multiple formatted sensor certified information sources (IBS/Integrated Broadcast System, AIS/Automated Identification System, COP/Common operating Picture, aircraft Radar Surveillance, USCG Sensor Data, etc.) received from multiple sources such as SIPRNET, the Coast Guard Tactical Information Network, the Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR), Manual data entry, and others.</p>
<p>The system shall implement proven embedded data fusion algorithms that support the processing tasks to generate a high confidence track database that can be displayed in real time to show violations of hazard/keep out range safety areas. System shall correlate into tracks near-real-time contact reports that contain positional and parametric information from multiple sensors and data sources, and shall fuse tracks from multiple sources (such as AIS and IBS) to provide a more informative and coherent situation awareness picture.</p>
<p>The system shall have the capability to process contact reports over a wide maritime area (~ 1000 nautical miles) around PMRF. This information is then used to determine if vessels are violating the Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) areas. This PMRF operational area is monitored beginning at least three days before each flight test mission to develop tracks and to project the positions of critical surface contacts in hazard areas to an estimated location at launch time. The system shall provide a variety of unique and customized tools, including some that are specifically developed to support the missions at PMRF. The extensive analysis and display tools available in the system shall be used to create a coherent and accurate maritime picture and can predict movement and location of vessels in the area of interest. The system shall import the results from the PMRF hazard analysis tool directly into its Exclusion Zone functionality. System Exclusion Zones shall provide an audible alarm when any vessel crosses into or remains in the designated NOTMAR and hazard areas. All data processed by the system shall be archived in the native raw format in which it was received so it can be re-played to perform post-mission analysis. A relational database shall be utilized to ensure persistent track information. Queries shall be executed on the database to retrieve track details or reconstruct the entire PMRF range status for any given time.</p>
<p>The system shall be able to coordinate range surveillance with P-3 or HC-130 aircraft in real time by providing cueing information to help the aircraft locate vessels in the hazard areas, exchanging Operational Notes (OPNOTES) via OTCIXS UHF satcom, and receiving contact reports for non-emitting vessels via AIS nets. The system shall be able to interface with a Tactical V(14) Replacement (TVR-1) to communicate with the aircraft over SATCOM.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor shall be able to replicate the situational awareness capabilities of the PMRF Battle Management Interoperability Center (BMIC) at a remote facility. The identical classified and unclassified data sources that are received in the BMIC shall also be accessible at a remote site to serve as a backup to the BMIC and conduct range surveillance remotely if the BMIC is unable to receive data or is non-operational.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY<br />The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 with a Small Business Size Standard of $27M. The Product Service Code is R425. Businesses of all sizes are encouraged to respond; however, each respondent must clearly identify their business size in their capabilities statement.<br />SUBMISSION DETAILS AND ADDITIOAL INFORMATION</p>

<DESC>UPDATE AS OF JANUARY 10, 2013*****************************<br />Justification and Approvals related to solicitation are posted below:
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the Department of the Navy. The contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL. The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes the construction of a new Support Systems Complex (SSC) that will provide pure water (DI) production, controlled pure water (CPW) production, compressed air low pressure (ALP) production, and an oily water separation (OWS) system. While the project constructs new systems to provide these services to the ships, they are required to connect to and integrate with existing systems that will not be replaced. This requires fittings that allow the connections to happen without extensive modifications to the existing systems. Exception to full and open competition is under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Hansen Products (Hansen), and OPW Engineered Systems (OPW). The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project. This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this Construction Contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension and an SSC to provide necessary utilities to the training ships. The existing systems and the existing ships must connect via hoses to the new systems, which need to have compatible fittings in order to make the distribution system function as designed.</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $1,954.05. The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Hansen <br />DI Quick Disconnect Fittings HK Series, 1" 3 ea<br />CPW Quick Disconnect Fittings HK Series, 1" 3 ea<br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings ST Series, 1" 8 ea. <br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings ST Series, 2" 4 ea. <br />OPW <br />OWS Dry Disconnect Fittings Epsilon, 3" 3 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The existing DI and CPW hose quick disconnect fittings at the facility are Hansen Quick Disconnect HK series. These components are used for connecting the DI and CPW site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing OWS dry disconnect couplings at this facility are Epsilon Dry Disconnect Couplings manufactured by OPW Engineering Systems. These components are used for connecting the OWS site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing ALP hose quick disconnect fittings are Hansen Quick Disconnect ST series connectors. These components are used in the maintenance activities for the training ships.<br />All site hoses used for a specific system must be identical for hose compatibility, procurement, maintenance, and testing reasons. In addition, Norfolk Naval Shipyard performs all maintenance on the ships and the fittings for the site must match the equipment and hoses from the shipyard in order to maintain compatibility with the maintenance equipment used for the ships. Using alternate products would require replacing disconnects on site hoses and valve stations at locations beyond the scope of this project as well as replacing expensive maintenance equipment or purchasing additional equipment to allow critical ship maintenance activities to be performed. This would result in a significant amount of rework and duplicate costs to the Government. Furthermore, an extensive modification to the existing systems would create unnecessary downtime and costs for this these mission critical systems.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured. No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL. The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes renovation and refurbishment of existing Building 2314 including replacement of multiple interior doors. Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to a specific manufacturer, namely Stanley Security Solutions (Stanley). The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project. This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The existing building is being renovated and refurbished. During the renovation work, the building will continue to be occupied and utilized for 24/7 training and administrative functions. The doors that are being upgraded must be controlled by security. In order to minimize security risks and life safety concerns, all doors in the building must be able to be controlled by one master key, which requires that the new cores are identical to the existing cores. The interchangeable cores for the door locks are manufactured by Stanley Security Systems and have been determined to be proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,340.96. The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Interchangeable core 45H7D15J626LHRB 44 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />It is essential for security and life safety purposes that all doors in the facility be controlled by only one master key. The existing interchangeable cores for the door locks are manufactured by Stanley Security Systems. Using alternate products would require replacing the locking mechanism on 119 doors currently used in the building. If multiple master keys are required in the building, it could result in delayed reactions during life safety events or security actions which would result in unacceptable outcomes.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only a specific manufacturer (Stanley) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.<br /><br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured. No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL. The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes construction of a new electrical distribution system including new substations and distribution feeders that connect into the existing base-wide distribution system and provide service to the new and existing ships and facilities. Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project. This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this construction contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension with two new and one replacement electrical substation as well as a new express feeder route from the Base electrical distribution system along Redbank Road to the site to provide redundant electrical supply to the site in support of the site. The system ties into the base-wide distribution system and must have protection from backfeeding when testing the generators on the site and the power plants on the ships. In order to accomplish this, protection relays are being installed. These protection relays are manufactured by SEL that are considered proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,000. The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Main breaker protection relay SEL-351S 2 ea.<br />Pier breaker protection relay SEL-751A 2 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />JB Charleston presently uses SEL relays in the substations and feeders on the Naval Weapons Station. For dependability and security for the electrical distribution system on the Naval Weapons Station, it is imperative that multiple computerized or "smart" relays use the same communication protocol and software to ensure the highest level of dependability for continuation of electric power and protection from cyber attacks. Cyber security is enhanced when all relays use the same software as software updates are easier to implement across one platform and password protocols are more likely to be understood and used. Furthermore, electrical maintenance personnel have been trained on how to use and maintain this make of relay. The procurement of any other make of relay would put an undue burden on JB Charleston maintenance personnel in terms of time and cost to be trained on another make of relay.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15. <br /><br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured. No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the U.S. Department of the Navy. The contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC). The contracting office is NAVFAC Southeast, IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />This justification seeks approval to limit competition in the procurement of certain intrusion detection system (IDS) and electronic surveillance system (ESS) components for installation under military construction (MILCON) projects P-100 and P-099, Nuclear Power Training Facilities, Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina. The MILCON projects include construction of three new buildings, a new berthing pier, and a new perimeter fence at the Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) site aboard Joint Base Charleston. This justification covers the use of proprietary components of three brand name manufacturers as follows: Lenel United Technologies (Lenel); Pelco by Schnieder Electric (Pelco); and Southwest Microwave Intrepid Fence Sensor (Intrepid). The specific components are listed below and will be specified in the respective contract specifications for the IDS and ESS systems.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this construction contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension with two new and one replacement electrical substation as well as a new express feeder route from the Base electrical distribution system along Redbank Road to the site to provide redundant electrical supply to the site in support of the site. The system ties into the base-wide distribution system and must have protection from backfeeding when testing the generators on the site and the power plants on the ships. In order to accomplish this, protection relays are being installed. These protection relays are manufactured by SEL that are considered proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The IDS and ESS components subject to this justification and approval (J&amp;A) include fence sensors, door sensors, surveillance cameras, cables, and control panels with a combined total estimated cost of approximately $825,277.00.<br />ITEM Description Quantity<br />Lenel <br />Intelligent System Controller #LNL-3300 15 ea. <br />Biometric Reader Interface #LNL-500B 2 ea. <br />Dual Reader Interface #LNL-1320 69 ea. <br />Input Control Module #LNL-1100 19 ea. <br />Output Control Module #LNL-1200 16 ea. <br />Pelco <br />Exterior PTZ dome camera SPECTRA S5220 1080P 49 ea. <br />Exterior fixed dome camera SARIX IEE20DN-1 8 ea. <br />Interior fixed dome camera SARIX IM10LW10-1V 27 ea. <br />Thermal IP positioning camera SARIX TI EST1314-2W 6 ea. <br />Thermal fixed camera SARIX TI650 4 ea. <br />Interior PTZ dome camera SPECTRA SD4N-W1 3 ea. <br />Parapet Mount PP350 6 ea. <br />Dual Parapet Mount SMR1-N9LN 8 ea. <br />Spectra Wall Mount SWM-GY 35 ea. <br />Spectra Pole Adapter SWM-PA-GY 35 ea. <br />Thermal Pole Mount Adapter EPM 10 ea. <br />Thermal Pole Mount EWM 10 ea. <br />Sarix Pendant Mount E-P 8 ea. <br />Sarix Pole Adapter WMVE-SR 8 ea. <br />Video system manager SMS-5200 2 ea. <br />Network system manager NSM5200-36 3 ea. <br />Video console display VCD5202 7 ea. <br />Video workstation WS5070 2 ea. <br />Video joystick controller KBD5000 9 ea. <br />/keyboard <br />Map Graphics WS5200-MAP 1 ea. <br />Video decoder NET5402-HD 1 ea. <br />Integration with LENEL SW-EVLNL-02 1 ea. <br />Ethernet media converter FX82011SSTR-2 130 ea. <br /><br />Intrepid <br />MicroPoint II Processor PM II 6 ea. <br />Link Unit II LU II 2 ea. <br />Termination Unit II TU II 6 ea. <br />MicroTrack Processor Module MTP II 3 ea. <br />MicroTrack End of Line Term MTT 10 ea. <br />Installation Service Tool UIST II 1 ea. <br />Control Setup Tool CST II 1 ea. <br />Lightning/Surge protector JB70A 6 ea. <br />Active infrared intrusion sensor 460B 2 ea.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The NPTU site is a military installation located within an active Department of Defense (DOD) explosive safety arc. It supports military training operations for the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program and other DOD operations. The site will remain operational and occupied by DOD military and civilian personnel during the construction period. It is imperative that the utmost military site security control be maintained at all times, especially during the construction period when there will be access by outside personnel and construction crews. The existing security system at the site is currently based on a proprietary LENEL system that is equipped with Intrepid sensors, PELCO closed circuit television stations, and Endura interface systems. To avoid any actual security gaps or potential security breaches, the integration of new security components into the existing system must be carefully scheduled and monitored by site security personnel to provide for a seamless transition and integration into the existing electronic surveillance system. The installation of any new IDS and ESS components must also be scheduled for installation and testing by trained security personnel. The site security personnel are trained to detect and respond to known technical issues with the existing systems, and are versed in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation procedures to minimize downtime and avoid system crashes. Experience with prior system maintenance has demonstrated that integration of other brand name system components requires additional downtime, which in this instance may result in untenable security compromises inconsistent with the required DOD security requirements for the nuclear site. Other brand names will not meet the agency requirements in this particular instance. The limited proprietary specifications are required to ensure continuity of military operations, enhance the protection of life safety, and maintain the required national security posture of the NPTU nuclear program platform.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement. A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (LENEL, PELCO, and Intrepid) can provide the products necessary to fulfill these requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices. The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action. The total proprietary items will be competitively procured. No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSCPAC) hereby publicizes its intention to solicit, negotiate, and award a firm fixed price purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Twiss Analytical Laboratories, Inc., 26280 Twelve Trees Lane, Poulsbo, WA 98370-9435, for Laboratory Analysis of Marine Water Samples.
This effort will require analytical lab services for weekly full suite of accredited lab testing and methodologies of the analytes for samples taken from six (6) different waterfront sites in and around marine mammal enclosures at Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor (NBK Bangor).  Lack of continuity in laboratory methodologies may lead to false interpretation of the overall environmental impact of the Swimmer Interdiction Security System (SISS) at NBK Bangor. Twiss Analytical Laboratories is the only firm currently possessing the immediate capability and close proximity to NBK Bangor necessary to preserve the integrity of the water samples collected.  Based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.
Acquisition of Comercial Items under FAR Part 12 and Simplified Acquisitions Procedures under FAR Part 13 apply.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $14 million.
Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing these services may be considered by the agency. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, and must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of services provided. Any comments, questions or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to simone.lucy@navy.mil.

Description from original Pre-Solicitation Notice and Amendment posted on March 31, 2014. 

The USGS plans to issue a competitive 8(a) solicitation to support the science and technical support needs of the USGS Science centers.  
The acquisition strategy involves the issuance of one solicitation, which will result in the award of up to six separate contracts. The USGS anticipates award of IDIQs, for each of the six service areas described in the original pre-solicitation notice. Each contract will include a base and four option years. Firms within the 8(a) program may submit a proposal on any and all service areas.  
The following firms have performed these requirements during the previous 24 months:
Five Rivers Services:  Contract G11PC00013 awarded April 2011 which services Biology and Water Science Centers, primarily supporting the National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette LA and Columbia Environmental Research Center in Columbia, MO. In addition, it also services centers in the prior South Central and Midwest Areas. Services include but not limited to biological, ecological and hydrologic research, environmental chemistry, and information management.  It was issued as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base and four option years. To date, a total of $13.8M has been obligated.

<a href="mailto:elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The NAICS code for this work is 237990 for dredging.   <br>   The New England District is acquiring an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Remedial Action Contract to support the District's work for United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the execution of the Superfund cleanup of New Bedford Harbor.      <br>        <br>    The Request for Proposal will be solicited under full and open competition and unrestricted to business size; per FAR subpart 19.704 all large businesses will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan. The Total Acquisition Value (TAV) of the contract awarded under this solicitation will not exceed $350M and will have a 10-year ordering period with a 3-year base period, two 2-year option periods and three 1-year option periods. The work will be performed primarily at the New Bedford Harbor site, although the contract will allow for work at other sites requiring these services within the mission areas of the North Atlantic Division. The awarded contract will include cost reimbursable task orders. This will be a performance-based procurement. Specific outcomes will be defined in each negotiated task order. Task orders will be awarded up to the maximum capacity of $350,000,000.00. There is no limit of the number of Task Order(s) that may be executed, but in no case shall the sum of all Task Order(s) executed exceed $350,000,000.00. The Government is obligated to satisfy a minimum guaranteed amount of not less than $200,000.00 over the base period of the contract.    <br>        <br>    The primary work involves dredging, de-sanding dewatering, and disposal of sediments contaminated with PCBs. Other requirements include the operation of a water treatment facility, technical support including evaluations, cost analysis, studies, investigations, and other remedial actions as necessary. The remedial action at the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (NBHSS) is expected to take less than 10 years to complete based on the current annual funding levels. NBHSS operations are unique in both their complexity and scale. Highly contaminated sediment is precisely dredged and  pumped in slurry through de-sanding, dewatering and treatment processes with the end product being clean water and dry filter cake that is then shipped to an offsite disposal facility. Strict cleanup criteria will need to be achieved by the RAC contractor in accordance with the criteria established in 1998 Record of Decision (ROD).  There are very few projects in the country that present the challenges faced by the contractor working in New Bedford.     <br>        <br>    The work under the solicitation involves providing all labor, equipment, materials, program/project/ construction management and engineering required to perform remediation of PCB contaminated sediment from the Acushnet River in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Remediation will be performed in accordance with the 1998 ROD and the four Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD).  This work includes sediment removal to cleanup levels, treatment and handling of the sediment and by products of processing of the sediment, transportation and disposal of contaminated material, maintenance, monitoring, and closure of Cell 1 (pilot CDF/Dredge Disposal Area), and monitoring of pilot cap area in the outer harbor. The work also includes remediation of wetlands and mudflat areas of the Acushnet River estuary. Proposed PCB disposal also includes construction of Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) cells to receive up to 300,000 cubic yards of untreated dredge material and will be performed under a separate contract.  The work performed under this solicitation may include disposal of some contaminated material in the constructed CAD cell.     <br>        <br>    As part of the remediation activities, a rigorous environmental monitoring program of air and water contamination will be implemented.  Results from the environmental monitoring program are used to ensure compliance with performance standards and may be used in contamination modeling applications.    <br>        <br>    Please note this is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about January 13, 2014. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil.    <br>        <br>

<a href="mailto:elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a PreSolicitation Notice set aside for HUBZone business contractors for Emergency Streambank Protection along the Connecticut River (THIS SOLICITATION WAS PREVIOUSLY SOLICITED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER W912WJ-13-B-0016). The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.   <br>        <br>  The proposed project will restore approximately 1300 feet of riverbank along the Connecticut River in Middletown, Connecticut along the eastern side of the John S. Roth Well Field on River Road. The purpose of the project is to stabilize the shoreline, and prevent further erosion of the riverbank. The project will be constructed under the special continuing authority contained in Section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (as amended). This project will be constructed in partnership with a local, non-Federal sponsor (the City of Middletown), and when completed will be turned over to the sponsor.   <br>        <br>  The construction project will consist of a stone toe along the bank below the water surface which will be buried, and then a layer stone revetment leading up the slope at which point the revetment will become recessed and covered with a layer of topsoil. The stone revetment will be placed only along selected locations of the bank, leaving approximately 30% of the existing floodplain forest intact. Stone protection that will be placed along the bank immediately adjacent to the well field will rest at an approximate 1:2 Vertical to Horizontal slope, which will become embedded, and covered, with topsoil. The topsoil will then be planted with native vegetation which will extend to the crest of the slope. The upper crest of the slope will then be planted with native trees. In addition, a series of bendway weirs are planned to be placed at the base of the lower bank within the intertidal area adjacent to the flow of the river.   <br>        <br>  This will not be a continuing contract. This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents, including instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April 23, 2014. Telephonic, mailed, and faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will not be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online. In order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to Elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil      <br>    <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS! The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for support services on the use of recently purchased nuclear measurement instrumentation and related software. Canberra Industries, Inc. provided this equipment under a previously competed contract. Detailed knowledge is required by AFTAC employees regarding the installed hardware, software and AFTAC LIMS/Canberra interface. This is a Sole Source with Canberra 800 Research Parkway, Meriden, CT 06450, IAW FAR 13.106-1(b). Canberra is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement because Canberra employees are the technical experts on the Radiation measurement system purchased for AFTAC/TML Laboratory under contract FA2521-13-P-0093. The attached Sole Source Justification has been made available for review. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This item proposes North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611420; size standard of $10M. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis by sending to 45cons.lgcb.e-bids@us.af.mil and SSgt Matthew Hagan at matthew.hagan.1@us.af.mil. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Canberra is the only source capable of providing this requirement.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 09, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) - Nashville Campus, Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO 9).  

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Under the authority of Public Law 104-262, and Title 38 U.S.C. 8153, the Contractor shall provide continuous delivery of Contractor operated primary care services, including primary care mental health and preventive medical care services in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions stated herein, and to furnish services to eligible veteran beneficiaries enrolled with the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (hereafter called TVHS). The contract will be structured as a firm-fixed-price (FFP) Per Member Per Month (PMPM) Capitated Rate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) using Interim Contract Authority (ICA) in accordance with VA Directive 1663 for a period not to exceed 180-days or 360-days if an exception is granted. This interim contract authority is necessary to ensure minimum disruption of primary health care (PHC) services for eligible veterans as the sole-source with a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) proceeds through the Medical Sharing Office (MSO) Contract Review Team (CRT) process for contract community-based outreach clinics

On or about January 10, 2014, the State of Tennessee notified the Director of the Tennessee Valley Health System that they had decided to terminate the contract for the Dover (Tennessee) Community Based Outpatient Clinic effective April 30, 2014. The Health and Human Services has designed this catchment area as a Healthcare Professional Shortage Area. This shortage of healthcare providers limits alternative sourcing plans. The Government will incur additional cost to procure these healthcare resources through Non-VA Care (Fee Bases) as these services are reimbursed at a non-facility Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) Code rate, due to the inadequate level of healthcare professions within this region the Government will incur additional travel reimbursement expenses to compensate veterans for their travel outside of acceptable travel distances. In addition, the Government ability to provide continuity of care through a single provider will be disrupted - this will directly impact eligible beneficiary's satisfaction with care provided due to elongated appointment times, decrease patient/provider appointment-interaction times, reduced appointment opportunities, increase travel to and from appointments, as well as, increase demands on veterans families and/or caregivers.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  A contractor needs to provide primary health care (PHC) and mental health care (MHC) for eligible beneficiaries residing in the communities and counties surrounding the Dover, Tennessee Community Based Outreach Clinic with an effective date of May 1, 2014 to prevent disruption in healthcare services. This is a Congressional approved community based outpatient clinic. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  This CBOC has been in continuous operation since (approximately) July 1, 1995. It has historically been a sole-source procurement with the State of Tennessee to jointly operate an Outreach Clinic to provide primary health care (PHC) to the counties of Benton, Houston, Humphries and Stewart (Henry County was originally included in this community based outpatient clinic, but was realigned during the current contract period with the Memphis VA Medical Center). 

On January 10, 2014 the State of Tennessee notified Tennessee Valley Healthcare System that it has decided to terminate the current contract effective March 31, 2014, through discussions the effective date has been extended to April 30, 2014. This does not provide TVHS and Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO-9) adequate time to procurement these healthcare services through normal procurement strategies without disrupting healthcare and creating undue financial injury to the Government and a hardship to the eligible veteran population living within these counties. 

Through market research and recent solicitations for similar community based outreach clinics throughout the Mid-South Healthcare Network (VISN 9) a veteran-owned small business (VOSB) was identified. Onsite Occupational Healthcare and Safety, Inc. is registered with VET-100 and is registered VOSB in the VETBIZ VIP database. Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 819.7008 allows contracting officers to award contracts to VOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided: 

The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5-million. The IGCE for this procurement is established for a firm-fixed-price Per Member Per Month at $82,290.00 per month for the estimated period of performance (POP) 04-03-2014 through 10-31-2014 based on the current vested enrollment of 750 eligible beneficiaries. The total estimated period of performance (POP) is $493,740.00; 

The contracting officer will synopsize the requirement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5; 

The VOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance. The contractor provides health care resources to both commercial industries and governments globally in geographically rural or isolated environments often providing the only healthcare within the region. They have previously received "exceptional" rating for a similar contract providing temporary healthcare services to the United States Air Force. They are currently providing Occupational Healthcare & Safety services to the Department of Veterans Affairs new regional medical center located in New Orleans, LA; 

Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. The Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO-9) has recently completed or is in the process of solicitations for similar healthcare resources throughout the geographical area supported by the contracting office (NCO-9) to compare cost/price information provided by the VOSB concern; 

Market research is supported by the lack of offers by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns in recent solicitations for similar community -based outreach clinics for the Mid-South Healthcare Network (VISN-9)and  that there are no responsible SDVOSB concerns that can provide these commercial healthcare services at this time; 

The VOSB concern is currently registered with VET-100 and verified in VETBIZ VIP database as a VOSB organization. 

Extensive market research of alternative sourcing plans indicates that the Government will be financially impacted due to mandated procurement lead times, formal approval processes, and elongated review processes for healthcare resources, as the government will need to utilize Non-VA Care (Fee Based) providers outside of the catchment area of the Dover (TN) CBOC. In addition, this will adversely impact Veterans and their families/caregivers as they will need to travel outside of the community to receive healthcare services due to a shortage of healthcare providers within this geographical area. The State of Tennessee sites its inability to hire qualified healthcare professionals for this rural community, this inability to recruit and retain qualified providers has limited healthcare services to PHC, which has resulted in intermediate gaps in coverage while they backfill these positions. This has also impacted the contractor's (State of Tennessee) ability to expand services to include MHC, which is currently provided by the TVHS - Nashville Campus Mental Health Department for eligible beneficiaries. A single contract for an optimal contract period ensures continuity of care is provided to this veteran population, while providing the Government adequate time to procure a long-term solution. 

It is not economically feasible to contract for a community-based outpatient clinic for a less-than optimal contract period (base year with four (4), one (1) year options). The Government acquires a great cost benefit by allowing the contractor to spread the start-up cost over a longer period of performance, opposed to front-loading these costs in a 12-month contract. Surrounding DoD Medical Treatment Facilities are above capacity and regional VA CBOCs are at or above capacity and unable to absorb these eligible veterans without elongated wait times for PHC and MHC. The closest VA CBOC is the Clarksville (TN) CBOC which is currently preparing the supporting documents to expand the existing facility from 10,000 square feet to approximately 25,000 square feet of usable footage for Congressional approval. This process is estimated to take six (6) months to a year to complete, another 18-months to 24-months to complete the leasing agreement and additional 12-months to 18-months to complete the build-out for a facility this size. 

The use of Interim Contact Authority, as prescribed in VA Directive 1663 limits the use of this authority for a period not to exceed 180-days, an exception can be granted to which allows the agency to include Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.217-8.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

As prescribed in FAR part 6.305(b) the justification for this urgent sole source procurement shall be posted within 30-days after contract award. 

VAAR Part 819.7008 allows contracting officers to award a sole source basis to a VOSB concern, provided the following criteria have been met: 

The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5.0-million; the IGCE for this Interim Contract Authority (not to exceed 360-days), estimates a firm-fixed-price Per Member Per Month cost at $82,290.00 for the current number of 750 vested eligible veterans; this estimate is dependent on several factors that might increase start-up cost such as the Government's ability to provide IT Equipment (to include a T-1 line), Tele-Health Equipment, temporary building to start initial services until build-out can occur at an acceptable site that meets current accessibility criteria and adequate space to provide all contracted PHC and MHC services. It is anticipated that these factors will be limited to the interim contract, but are dependent on the Government to acquire and provide the items identified within the agreement. The VOSB is registered with VET-100 and verified in VETBIZ's VIP database as a VOSB concern that has provided healthcare services to other commercial industries and federal agencies in rural and/or isolated locations globally. As previously stated this action can be made at a fair and reasonable price. Market research is supported by the fact that no responsible SDVOSB concern has responded to previous solicitation for similar commercially available healthcare service contracts. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The negotiated price/cost for this sole-source contract with a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern can be determined to be "fair and reasonable" based on a comparison between the negotiated firm-fixed-price Per Member Per Month (PMPM) Capitated Rate for PHC and MHC. Network Contracting Office (NCO-9) has completed several unrestricted solicitations for similar sized contracted CBOCs, providing similar health care resources to eligible beneficiaries.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As prescribed in FAR Part 10.002(b)(1), contracting officers may use market research conducted within 18-months before the award of any task or delivery order if the information is still current, accurate, and relevant. There was a Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought Notice issued for the current contract (VA249-12-D-0285) to identify interested parties to provide these commercial healthcare services to the communities and counties currently served by the Dover (TN) CBOC, the results are provided below: 

Valor Healthcare, a subsidiary of Humana Government Business, Inc., is a large business who provides similar outpatient clinic services across the Mid-South Healthcare Network (VISN-9). This firm is Joint Commission accredited under the Ambulatory Care Program. 

Premier medical Group, PC is assumed to be a large business as their SAM registration expired on April 16, 2013; this firm provided notification that due to the American Care Act (ACA) the Board of Directors determined that they would not be consider this opportunity. 

Deltec.com made an inquiry into the incumbent contractor for these services, failed to respond to the RFI/Sources Sought Notice. A search of Duns and Bradstreet suggest this firm is no longer in business, there is no record of this firm registering in the System for Award Management (SAM), and a search of SBA Dynamic Small Business Search database was unsuccessful. 

The final response to this RFI/Sources Sought Notice was Onsite Occupational Health & Safety, Inc., a Veteran Owned Small Business concern (verified in VETBIZ VIP database effective July 25, 2012). In addition, this firm is Joint Commission accredited for Ambulatory Care and has received the Joint Commission Gold Seal of Approval for Health Care Staffing Services. This firm has extensive experience providing Primary Health Care (PHC) for the Department of Defense (DoD) operating 26 Forward Operating Bases in Afghanistan South and eight (8) additional clinics in Afghanistan North. In addition, they provide healthcare services to other commercial industries such as energy (oil drilling sites) globally.   

Market research and review of recent community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) across Mid-South Healthcare Network (VISN-9) indicates a tread to utilize unrestricted procurement strategies due to inadequate competition by small business concerns. The Network (VISN-9) has not had success with previous small business concerns providing these commercially available healthcare services, requiring the VA Medical Centers (VAMC) to use alternative sourcing to provide primary health care (PHC) and mental health care (MHC) to beneficiaries until a long term solution could be implemented.  

Additional market research suggests that current healthcare providers within the region are at or beyond capacity. Alternative sourcing for primary health care (PHC) through Non-VA Care (fee basis) will require Veterans and their families/caregivers to travel outside of this geographical area to receive care. This is not an economically feasible solution; this will greatly increase the cost for the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System to provide primary health care (PHC) to beneficiaries. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

Under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8128, the VA has established contracting priority for veteran-owned and controlled small businesses. VAAR Part 819.7004 states in determining the acquisition strategy applicable to an acquisition, the contracting officer shall consider, in the following order of priority, contracting preferences that ensure contracts will be awarded: 

(a)	To SDVOSBs; 
(b)	To VOSB, including but not limited to SDVOSBs; 
(c)	Pursuant to - 
1.	Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a); or 
2.	The Historically - Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program (15 U.S.C 657(a); 
(d)	Pursuant to any other small business contracting preference.

VAAR Part 819.7008, provides criteria for contracting officer to award to a VOSB on a sole source basis, On Site Occupational Health and Safety, Inc. is registered in VET100 and has been verified in the VETBIZ VIP database as a VOSB (July 25, 2012). 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See section 8 above. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

An Interim Contract Authority (ICA) shall be used to mitigate financial impairment due to increased cost to provide primary health care (PHC) to these eligible beneficiaries with minimum disruption while the Agency seeks a long-term contract solution with an optimum contract period of performance. The ICA will provide adequate time for the government to review the business plan for this Congressional approved Community Base Outreach Clinic (CBOC), evaluate alternative sourcing strategy to provide PHC and mental health care (MHC) for beneficiaries residing within the designated geographical area for this CBOC, prepare supporting documents to revise the current business plan for Congressional review and approval, and implement revisions to the original business plan approved by Congress.  

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>UPDATE AS OF JANUARY 10, 2013*****************************<br />Justification and Approvals related to solicitation are posted below:
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the Department of the Navy.  The contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL.  The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida</p>
<p>2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes the construction of a new Support Systems Complex (SSC) that will provide pure water (DI) production, controlled pure water (CPW) production, compressed air low pressure (ALP) production, and an oily water separation (OWS) system.  While the project constructs new systems to provide these services to the ships, they are required to connect to and integrate with existing systems that will not be replaced.  This requires fittings that allow the connections to happen without extensive modifications to the existing systems.  Exception to full and open competition is under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Hansen Products (Hansen), and OPW Engineered Systems (OPW).  The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project.  This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this Construction Contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension and an SSC to provide necessary utilities to the training ships.  The existing systems and the existing ships must connect via hoses to the new systems, which need to have compatible fittings in order to make the distribution system function as designed.</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $1,954.05.  The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM				Description	Quantity<br />Hansen		<br />DI Quick Disconnect Fittings	HK Series, 1"	3 ea<br />CPW Quick Disconnect Fittings	HK Series, 1"	3 ea<br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings	ST Series, 1"	8 ea. <br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings	ST Series, 2"	4 ea. <br />OPW 	<br />OWS Dry Disconnect Fittings	Epsilon, 3"	3 ea.</p>
<p>4.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5.	RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The existing DI and CPW hose quick disconnect fittings at the facility are Hansen Quick Disconnect HK series.  These components are used for connecting the DI and CPW site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses.  The existing OWS dry disconnect couplings at this facility are Epsilon Dry Disconnect Couplings manufactured by OPW Engineering Systems.  These components are used for connecting the OWS site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing ALP hose quick disconnect fittings are Hansen Quick Disconnect ST series connectors.  These components are used in the maintenance activities for the training ships.<br />All site hoses used for a specific system must be identical for hose compatibility, procurement, maintenance, and testing reasons.  In addition, Norfolk Naval Shipyard performs all maintenance on the ships and the fittings for the site must match the equipment and hoses from the shipyard in order to maintain compatibility with the maintenance equipment used for the ships. Using alternate products would require replacing disconnects on site hoses and valve stations at locations beyond the scope of this project as well as replacing expensive maintenance equipment or purchasing additional equipment to allow critical ship maintenance activities to be performed.  This would result in a significant amount of rework and duplicate costs to the Government.  Furthermore, an extensive modification to the existing systems would create unnecessary downtime and costs for this these mission critical systems.</p>
<p>6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7.	DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>8.	ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL.  The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes renovation and refurbishment of existing Building 2314 including replacement of multiple interior doors.  Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to a specific manufacturer, namely Stanley Security Solutions (Stanley).  The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project.  This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The existing building is being renovated and refurbished.  During the renovation work, the building will continue to be occupied and utilized for 24/7 training and administrative functions.  The doors that are being upgraded must be controlled by security.  In order to minimize security risks and life safety concerns, all doors in the building must be able to be controlled by one master key, which requires that the new cores are identical to the existing cores.  The interchangeable cores for the door locks are manufactured by Stanley Security Systems and have been determined to be proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,340.96.  The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM				Description		Quantity<br />Interchangeable core		45H7D15J626LHRB	44 ea.</p>
<p>4.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5.	RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />It is essential for security and life safety purposes that all doors in the facility be controlled by only one master key. The existing interchangeable cores for the door locks are manufactured by Stanley Security Systems.  Using alternate products would require replacing the locking mechanism on 119 doors currently used in the building.   If multiple master keys are required in the building, it could result in delayed reactions during life safety events or security actions which would result in unacceptable outcomes.</p>
<p>6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only a specific manufacturer (Stanley) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7.	DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.<br /> <br />8.	ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL.  The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes construction of a new electrical distribution system including new substations and distribution feeders that connect into the existing base-wide distribution system and provide service to the new and existing ships and facilities.  Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL).  The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project.  This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this construction contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension with two new and one replacement electrical substation as well as a new express feeder route from the Base electrical distribution system along Redbank Road to the site to provide redundant electrical supply to the site in support of the site.  The system ties into the base-wide distribution system and must have protection from backfeeding when testing the generators on the site and the power plants on the ships.  In order to accomplish this, protection relays are being installed.  These protection relays are manufactured by SEL that are considered proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,000.  The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM				Description	Quantity<br />Main breaker protection relay	SEL-351S	2 ea.<br />Pier breaker protection relay	SEL-751A	2 ea.</p>
<p>4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />JB Charleston presently uses SEL relays in the substations and feeders on the Naval Weapons Station.  For dependability and security for the electrical distribution system on the Naval Weapons Station, it is imperative that multiple computerized or "smart" relays use the same communication protocol and software to ensure the highest level of dependability for continuation of electric power and protection from cyber attacks.  Cyber security is enhanced when all relays use the same software as software updates are easier to implement across one platform and password protocols are more likely to be understood and used.  Furthermore, electrical maintenance personnel have been trained on how to use and maintain this make of relay.  The procurement of any other make of relay would put an undue burden on JB Charleston maintenance personnel in terms of time and cost to be trained on another make of relay.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15. <br /> <br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the U.S. Department of the Navy.  The contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC).  The contracting office is NAVFAC Southeast, IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2.

<p>4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The NPTU site is a military installation located within an active Department of Defense (DOD) explosive safety arc.  It supports military training operations for the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program and other DOD operations.  The site will remain operational and occupied by DOD military and civilian personnel during the construction period.  It is imperative that the utmost military site security control be maintained at all times, especially during the construction period when there will be access by outside personnel and construction crews. The existing security system at the site is currently based on a proprietary LENEL system that is equipped with Intrepid sensors, PELCO closed circuit television stations, and Endura interface systems.  To avoid any actual security gaps or potential security breaches, the integration of new security components into the existing system must be carefully scheduled and monitored by site security personnel to provide for a seamless transition and integration into the existing electronic surveillance system.  The installation of any new IDS and ESS components must also be scheduled for installation and testing by trained security personnel.  The site security personnel are trained to detect and respond to known technical issues with the existing systems, and are versed in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation procedures to minimize downtime and avoid system crashes.  Experience with prior system maintenance has demonstrated that integration of other brand name system components requires additional downtime, which in this instance may result in untenable security compromises inconsistent with the required DOD security requirements for the nuclear site.  Other brand names will not meet the agency requirements in this particular instance.  The limited proprietary specifications are required to ensure continuity of military operations, enhance the protection of life safety, and maintain the required national security posture of the NPTU nuclear program platform.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (LENEL, PELCO, and Intrepid) can provide the products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>

The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>

<DESC>To provide interactive access to over 750,000 users worldwide, MODS utilizes three distinct platforms: 1) the US Army Network Infrastructure Support Command - Pentagon Enterprise Server; 2) the MODS Web Server; and 3) the user's desk top.  AMEDD medical treatment facilities and administrative offices have adequate hardware and connectivity capability to utilize MODS' web-based solutions without additional hardware or infrastructure. The hardware architecture consists of an Enterprise and Internet architecture.  The fundamental host for the hardware environment is an IBM Z9 mainframe with z/OS 1.8 operated by ITA.  It employs the IBM DB2 v8.1 RDBMS for transactional processing using a CICS interface for data entry and reporting using TSO, and the communications protocols for the various networking environments reside on the Enterprise Server. The web server environment consist twenty-nine blade servers (IBM LS24 & HS21) that subscribes to a NetApp storage array and Tivoli management services furnished at the enterprise (hosting) level. There is a collection of equipment to support the communications connections including an IBM Open Systems Adaptor, an IBM 3172, multiple IBM 3174's, several Cisco routers, Ethernet hubs and switches, digital telecom switches, a bank of modems, and several CSU/DSU. The principal Internet component of the environment is the MODS Web Server environment is located at the Pentagon Data Center, Arlington, VA.  This provides a stable, fault-tolerant and scalable server platform that supports the MODS Web Applications. The fifty MODS Web Server applications are hosted on an infrastructure of clustered and load-balanced web application servers, clustered and load-balanced web service servers, and clustered database servers.  Critical storage requirements are supported by a Storage Area Network (SAN).  The servers are configured with a combination of Microsoft Windows 2008 Server Standard and Enterprise Editions.  The database servers use a combination of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Standard and Enterprise Editions.  Software is developed using the Microsoft .NET Framework primarily written in the C# Language. The Integrated Development Environment used as Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Team Foundation Server, SQL Server Enterprise Manager and other applications.The MODS Web Server environment is also used in-concert with the MODS Data Warehouse (MDW). The MDW is the most recent addition to the MODS operating environment. It is the principal data analysis environment slated for analytical super-users. The MDW was constructed with the Dell/Microsoft Parallel Data Warehouse - Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) Appliance (Microsoft SQL Server 2008R2 & HPC) coupled with MicroStrategy 9.3 for data visualization. The current operating environment is replicated at a remote Contingency Operations (COOP) site. MODS' COOP components operate as mixed hot and warm site designed for rapid disaster recovery. Server based and web based applications are developed to run on Army standard desktop configurations.  The customer workstations primarily run DoD supported Operating Systems with supported Web browsers.  Additional software applications can be required to meet customer requirements.Communications access for both the Enterprise Server and the MODS Server is provided through TCP/IP gateways over the Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet). The OTSG supports TCP/IP as a standard for Personal Computer Communications from remote locations via the NIPRNet or the Internet.
