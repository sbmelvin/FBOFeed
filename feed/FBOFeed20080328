<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 605 Washington, DC 20006.  The anticipated date of award is April 18, 2008.

The purpose of this contract is to discuss issues of mutual interest at the NPN Prevention Research Conference, August 24-27, 2008, in Indianapolis, Indiana; and at the annual Conference in June 2009.  To provide scholarship funding for a limited number of NPNs to attend the Annual Conference in June 2009.  To plan and implement the 2008 Exemplary Awards for substance abuse prevention programs at the Research Conference in August, 2008.  The Exemplary Awards Program has sought to identify and honor outstanding achievements in substance abuse prevention. 

The Exemplary Awards Program is designed to seek out programs that demonstrate results.  The Exemplary Awards for innovative programs recognize and showcase evidence-based, state-of-the-art substance abuse prevention programs that may be replicated by others; these awards serve to focus national attention on the field of substance abuse prevention.  The 2007 Innovative Programs will be showcased at the National Prevention Network?s Prevention Research Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, August 24-27, 2008.

The contractor in collaboration with CSAP will convene two Leadership Summits across two fiscal years- August, 2008 and June, 2009.  The first is to be co-located with the NPN
Prevention Research Conference in August, 2008, while the second is to be convened during the NASADAD annual membership meeting in June, 2009.  The Contractor's Project Director will work with the CSAP Government's Project Officer in the identification of common goals, the crafting of a common vision, and the identification of barriers to the adoption of a sound, evidence-based prevention system.  These discussions will be informed by the CSAP Director and/or Deputy Director, as well as the Contractor's Executive Director.

The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Inc. (NASADAD) is a private, not-for-profit educational, scientific, and informational organization.  The
Association was originally incorporated in 1971 to serve State Drug Agency Directors, And then in 1978 the membership was expanded to include State Alcoholism Agency Directors.  NASADAD is uniquely qualified to execute this task because it is the
Membership organization for the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors and National prevention Network Associates who are the target audience for these two activities ? the Exemplary Awards and the Leadership Summit.

NASADAD?s basic purpose is to foster and support the development of effective alcohol and other drug abuse prevention and treatment programs throughout every State.

 The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

The IRM/OPS/ENM is requesting authorization to procure software, routers, switches, memory adaptors, cables and connectors and related accessories with associated licensing and maintenance that is IPv6 capable in support of the IPv6 project. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. ENM team is tasked with meeting OMB mandate memorandum M-05-22, which requires federal agencies to have the ability to route IPv6 traffic through the network core.  ENM is currently using Cisco equipment to route traffic in the network core.  We must upgrade the core network equipment in order to meet this mandate.  For warranty purposes, Cisco recommends that we use Cisco spare parts, such as memory, when performing the upgrade. Cisco not only has the ITCCB authorized software but has supplied it in the past and is familiar with the requirements. Research has been conducted and it has been determined that acquiring the Cisco products is the most cost effective means to meet the DoS support requirements. We are upgrading existing Cisco equipment and this equipment is the only authorized by Cisco to use in their routers.  Utilizing equipment other than Cisco could be grounds for disqualification of SmartNet maintenance contracts.<BR><BR>

Launched in 1999, REACH 2010 was the cornerstone of CDC?s efforts to eliminate racial and ethic disparities in health in the following six priority areas: cardiovascular disease, immunizations, breast and cervical cancer screening and management, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and infant mortality. The racial and ethnic groups targeted by REACH 2010 were African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Pacific Islanders, as a part of program evaluation, REACH 2010 Risk Factor Survey was conducted annually from 2001 through 2006 in 27 communities targeting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast and cervical cancer. 

Starting October 1, 2007, REACH across the United States moves into establishing a national multilevel program that approaches the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities through the application, synthesis, and dissemination of promising public health practices. The priority areas are cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke), diabetes, breast and cervical cancer, adult/older adult immunization and Hepatitis B.  Evaluation of the programs in REACH U.S. communities will include conducting the annual Risk Factor Survey in 29 communities in the next 5 years.   

The core tasks for the contract will include: 1) Design sampling plans for the survey in 28 communities in different geographical areas; 2) Develop survey instrument and procedures which includes finalizing and translating the REACH U.S. Risk Factor Survey Questionnaire to Hispanic, Vietnamese, Khmer, Mandarin Chinese, and  Haitian Creole; 3) Recruit and train interviewers to ensure interviewers possess the required skill levels to perform the tasks; 4) Consult with communities to identify appropriate geographic areas of the community; 5) Conduct a field test to test the entire survey system, including sampling, scheduling, and receipt control functions; 6) Propose and implement methodologies that increase response rate; 7) Perform telephone interview using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI).  The estimated total telephone calls placed are expected to exceed 1.2 millions; 8) Perform more than 100,000 household screening interviews (approximately 3 minutes per screening) each year; 9) Obtain about 26,000 completed interviews (approximately 15 minutes per interview) in adult family members each year (900 respondents in each community); 10) Administer the survey in each community in similar months (within 3 months range) each year; 11) Convert the data in the computer files of CATI to a form that can be analyzed using SAS; and 12) Prepare, edit, and delivery to CDC the annual data file and documentation.

Evaluation criteria include: 1) Experience, and Past Performance; 2) Management Plan; and 3) Scientific and Technical Approach.

Award of a performance based, cost-plus fixed-fee contract is contemplated. The period of performance will be 60-months, with five (5) incrementally funded phases.  Full and Open Competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  The NAICS Code is 541720.

Enter relevant data into the consultant exchange database (web-based system used as a service of common concern for all CSAT member contractors providing data on and needing access to a pool of experts) in the topic areas of CSAT's population-specific initiatives and its planning, financing, performance management, data collection and reporting and clinical initiatives. These consultants will provide on- and off-site technical assistance to State substance abuse offices or providers (or as required by other contracts participating in the Consultant Exchange Data Base (CEDB) and others). Input data into the complimentary component of the CEDB, the technical assistance tracking system (TA Tracker). The TA tracking system contains both coded and detailed narrative information on TA activities including personnel, experts and budget required to complete the activity. The system can sort and organize the data into a variety of reports, enabling member contractors to report in a standard and uniform format. The TA Tracker is also used as a management tool by federal government project officers. 3. Assist in design and convening of off- and on-site technical assistance in areas of need identified by CSAT or the State and Territories substance abuse offices. 4. Develop reports and documents to support the requirements of the project and that can be used by the States and Territories to strengthen their ability to plan, manage, enhance and monitor their substance abuse treatment services and service systems. These include, but are not limited to, technical reports, literature reviews, manuals, special reports, analytical reports, guidelines, and conduct annual state satisfaction assessment.  5. Assist in design, planning, organize and support of large conference.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>GSA's Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS), a business line of the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), has recently begun an organization-wide program to evaluate the procurement of Less-Then Truckload (LTL) and Truckload (TL) motor freight services. It is looking to reduce transportation costs while maintaining or improving quality and service.  GSS plans to do so through the implementation of a program that establishes stronger and closer relationships with one or more carriers.  It is GSS' goal to offer its outbound freight-all-kinds (FAK) shipments, moving via closed vans for LTL and TL shipments.  It is believed that both the carriers participating in this program and GSS will reap substantial benefits by determining methods of joint process improvement. 

This solicitation is being released via the Internet through the FedBizOpps site at: www.fbo.gov.  In order to conduct this procurement most effectively, all notices and postings will be made at this location.  Please be aware that the solicitation, questions and answers, comments, or any other information will not be disseminated in any other format.  Be sure you check the web site regularly for any amendments.  We suggest that you also bookmark GSA's GSS web site as it contains information of interest associated with GSS programs:  www.gsa.gov/gss.  

GSA is currently soliciting for proposals to provide transportation services as outlined in the attached solicitation.  The services are for outbound LTL and TL shipments originating from GSS' two distribution centers and moving within the Continental United States (CONUS) at this time.  The Eastern Distribution Center (EDC) is located at 1900 River Road, Burlington, NJ 08016.  The Western Distribution Center (WDC) is located at 700 E Roth Road, Bldg 230, French Camp, CA 95231.  Based on 12 months of shipment data, spanning November 2006 through October 2007, GSS' total annual expenditures for outbound LTL and TL shipments moving within CONUS is approximately $13 million.  

The solicitation is an effort by the GSA to determine whether savings over current costs can be achieved through an independent contract vehicle with one or more quality suppliers.  GSA makes no guarantee that a contract award will be made and will not pay costs incurred by firms in responding to the solicitation.

Since September 11, 2001, DTRA's mission has evolved to a more complex and robust mission, that requires a more integrated approach to delivering IT.

In addition to the DTRC, the CIO provides IT services to several smaller field offices in the National Capitol Region (NCR), the DTRA Albuquerque office and other CONUS and OCONUS sites.

The Agency needs a seasoned IT performer to focus on the integrated delivery of IT services and solutions supporting IT requirements across the Agency.     

The Agency requires the provider(s) to integrate the current IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing 24/7/365 IT functional support to all DTRA facilities, both CONUS and OCONUS along with providing built-in capabilities to address future enhancement, modernization and technology changes. 

Potential sources will be required to satisfy organizational conflict of interest requirements.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with T-VEC Technologies Inc., 2214 Rock Hill Road, Herndon, VA 20170 to provide enhancements to an existing toolkit, accepted for use by Transportation Security Administration (TSA)/Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The original toolkit-the TWIC Card application and Conformance Testing Toolkit was developed by T-VEC. The National Maritime Security Advisory Committee published the ?TWIC Reader Hardware and Card Application Specification? which calls for issuance of secure, interoperable credentials through the medium of smart cards to secure our nation?s maritime facilities. T-VEC exhibited superior technical expertise in interpreting these specifications to develop a toolkit that contains 102 conformances tests for testing a TWIC Smart Card for conformance to these specifications. This toolkit was tested by NIST its features demonstrated to TSA/DHS and has been found to be acceptable to both NIST and TSA/DHS. Based on the thorough knowledge of the logic of the tests (being the original developer) and the investment T-VEC has already made an understanding and interpreting the test, T-VEC is in the best technical position to perform the necessary enhancements. Further T-VEC has established their credential in developing two reliable, industrial strength conformance testing toolkits- ?PIV Card application and Middleware Testing Toolkit? and ?PIV Data Model Conformance Testing Toolkit? which are currently being used by NIST NPIVP AND GSA FIPS 201-EP evaluation programs to certify products for conformance to FIPS 201 specifications to meet the goals of presidential directive HSPD-12.  
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about April 7, 2008.
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The purpose of the AFI is to convert to electronic media the information exchanges (e.g., form SSA-4641-U2) that now occurs in paper form between FIs and SSA; obtain titling, balance and related information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor in addition to verifying the account balance and interest income revealed by the applicant, recipient or deemor; detect unreported accounts in financial institutions located in proximity to the home address of the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor and to automate the process whereby FIs are reimbursed for the cost of account verification.  SSA is seeking continued contractor support to maintain the front-end and back-end operation of the SSI Asset Verification Program, including the GUARD Application, which SSA and Accuity have worked on for the past four years.  Accuity serves as the official registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institution that meets the criteria established by the ABA; it is believed that every financial institution in the US must utilize them to assign, to retire, or to change a routing number.  In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, Accuity collects, processes, and maintains a database of current information on financial institutions worldwide.  SSA previously awarded successive orders, of one year each, to Accuity, for the Proof of Concept (POC) for these services. During the POC phase, Accuity successfully demonstrated a process for verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states.  This phase of the POC demonstrated that the system design and its operation would substantially improve the SSA-4641-U2 process.  The next phase of the POC involved an expansion of Accuity automated asset verification process including the use of Accuity's Geographical Undisclosed Account Radial Detection (GUARD) function to detect undisclosed financial accounts to all 110 Field Offices (FO) in the states of New York and New Jersey and to a limited number of users in the Office of Quality Performance (OQP) 15 regional sites.  QOP conducted an extensive evaluation of the Accuity process in New York/New Jersey FO's and the findings supported the expansion of the Accurity process to additional SSA FO's nationwide and the recruitment of additional FI?s as participants.  As a result of OQP's study SSA contracted with Accuity to expand its operations to all FO's in the state of California.  SSA now intends to issue a firm fixed price contract for the period April 2008 thru January 2009, for (a) continued support of the front-end and back-end operation of the SSI Asset Verification Program, including the GUARD application in the New York/New Jersey and California FO's and OQP's regional sites; (b) management information, program data and analytical support for evaluating ongoing operations and additional Program growth opportunities for current and future phases and (c) develop an isolated/dedicated facility for encrypting backups for files associated with SSI Asset Verification Program.  To date, Accuity is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers, name and social security number as the identifying information.  SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services.  The research has resulted in Accuity being the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA.  Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accuity for follow-on services and is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Accuity may respond in writing no later than February 22, 2008, with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA?s objective.  Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information.  Interested parties that feel they can provide these services shall respond by submitting their capability statement by e-mail to Valerie.Jones@ssa.gov.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT-- FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with negotiations with Accuity.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the closing date through 04/21/2008.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type of contract for this acquisition of various parts for the  Fisher & Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 including but not limited to: Post Scales (for weighing assembly), NSN:  6660-00-228-0258, ASN: D111-3SP119,  F&P part number (P/N) 403C00A12 or equivalent; Punch and Die Assembly, NSN:  6625-00-350-3541, ASN:  D111-8A162,  F&P P/N 625A401U01 or equivalent; Lower Case Assembly, NSN:  6660-01-117-7567, ASN:  D111-1A100-2,  F&P P/N 18312 or equivalent; Funnel, NSN:  6660-00-071-0435, ASN:  D111-1SP105, F&P P/N 351C101U01 or equivalent, these parts are used to support the NWS ASOS program.  These parts must be in accordance with (IAW) Fischer & Porter Company, Parts List for Precipitation Gage-Recorder, for series 35B1558 and 35B1559 (attached).   

The Fischer and Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 was originally manufactured in the early 1980?s for the National Weather Service (NWS).  The F&P consists of two main parts, a rain-collecting pan that will hold a total of about 19.5 inches of rain and an automatic, yet intricate and delicate, weighing and recording mechanism.  Every 15 minutes, a timer activates the recording mechanism and holes are punched into a paper tape (or strip chart) indicating the cumulative amount of collected rainfall to the nearest tenth of an inch using a weight to depth conversion factor.  The paper tape is divided into frames; each individual frame is divided into 24 hour segments.  At the beginning of each month, an observer is tasked with removing the tape and sending it to the local NWS office.  There, it is examined and forwarded to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and publication as official Hourly Precipitation Data.  The F&P (ASN:  D111) is a legacy system in dire need of an upgrade.  This upgrade comes in the form of the Fischer & Porter Upgrade (FPU), in which the existing punch mechanism will be replaced with a digital data recording system.  Until all F&P weighing rain gages can be upgraded at the higher cost FPU, NWS must support the legacy components to sustain the established cooperative network.  Because the F&P weighing rain gage was originally procured from Belfort Instrument Company by part number, they are the only source known to have the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture a part that complies with the F&P Part Numbers as stated herein. 
 
The Government at its discretion may make multiple awards for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts for this equipment, each will cover a five (5) year period.  The Government at its discretion may require first article testing.  The acquisition(s) will be conducted in accordance with the processes set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12.6 ? Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  A solicitation will be issued on or before April 4, 2008 and will be uploaded to the FedBizOpps, the solicitation can also be requested via fax to 816-274-6923, Attn: Carey Marlow or via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov.  The proposal due date and time will be published in the solicitation.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  It will be the responsibility of interested parties to download the solicitation and related documents, and to revisit the site frequently to obtain any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  This solicitation and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-23).  The prices proposed shall be inclusive of all costs.  Firms other than Belfort Instrument Company, interested in this requirement must respond to this notice by submitting demonstrated evidence of its capability and experience in manufacturing the exact part specified and its use in the F&P weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559.

<DESC>The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) Directorate of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA-CBRNE) is seeking sources for technical support to provide for the design and installation of a suitable Evacuation Guidance System (EGS) for the Pentagon Shield (PS) system. The PS system was developed to assist PFPA-CBRNE accomplish their mission of protecting staff on the Pentagon Reservation in the event of a hazardous material release. The PS system includes a command and control system linking interior and exterior sensor networks, interior and exterior contaminant transport models, and staff egress models.  The PS system provides automated emergency response, enabling PFPA-CBRNE staff to mitigate potential occupant exposure to hazardous material aerosols and vapors in the event of an intentional or accidental release. 

The EGS is a principal component of the PS system that shall provide occupant egress routing and way finding during an emergency event using dynamic lighting. The EGS will include hardware (lighting) components and the command and control system interface.  An Opto 22 control system backbone currently exists within the Pentagon and is integral to the PS command and control system.  The EGS components have the capability of being dynamically controlled and provide status feedback via Opto 22 input/output devices to the PS command and control system.

The EGS hardware (lighting) components are to include directional corridor and stair way finding lighting, and fixed lighting elements to indicate availability of doors and of protective masks in designated mask supply boxes.  The lighting must be capable of providing static and blinking lighting modes in green, yellow, and red and be visible in smoky conditions.  The lighting will be controlled by the digital Opto 22 module unless a justifiably better approach is proposed.  The materials used in the EGS installation are to be flame retardant, capable of functioning in a fire event, and compatible with the existing corridor interior finishes. 

The Pentagon is currently undergoing renovations under the Pentagon Renovation (PENREN) Program in phases where sections of the building are stripped to the bare concrete slabs and are rebuilt. The PENREN Program is scheduled to be completed by 2011. The support contract will be divided into three phases, the first phase lasting 24 months. Phase 1 of the installation includes installation of EGS components in a retrofit mode in the newly renovated areas of the building (approximately 60% of each floor). Phase 2 and Phase 3 installations in the remainder of the building may be done in conjunction with the PENREN activities. 

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring Electronic Data Standards (EDS) are compliant with the Pentagon Renovation & Constriction Program EDS (PRPEDS) and obtaining all permits for EGS installation and qualified personnel before commencing construction.  All work performed under this effort must be in compliance with the following codes and standards: Electrical Code NEC1999 (NFPA 70), Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code; Fire/Life Safety Code IFC 2000 Virginia Statewide Fire Prevention Code; UL 924 Emergency Lighting and Power Equipment.

An Industry Day will be held at the Pentagon prior to the proposal submission deadline to provide potential Contractors with additional technical information and a site survey.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Development of Educational Campaigns and Materials for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The role of FDA?s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN?s) Office of Food Defense, Communication, and Emergency Response (OFDCER) has evolved over the years to include information and outreach on CFSAN programs for producers, transporters, operators of retail establishments, health professionals along with extensive, hands-on food safety and nutrition education programs for consumers including children, older Americans, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.  Education is critical because consumers are the ?final link? in the food chain that runs from the farm to the table.
Over the years, FDA?s education campaigns have kept pace with burgeoning new technology, scientific advances, new risks and potential pathogens, and types of foods being offered to U.S. consumers.
The agency continues to inform consumers about safe food handling and preparation, and gives them the information they need to prepare healthy, nutritious meals for themselves and their families.
CFSAN?s food safety education efforts typically support the Partnership for Food Safety Education?s Fight BAC! and Be Food Safe messages, for food safety, various guidelines and good manufacturing practices documents developed by CFSAN for sectors of the food industry, or focus on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the nutrition facts label, for nutrition. Educational materials are targeted to a variety of audiences including, but not limited to, the media, schools, health professionals, and specific groups of consumers who are at-risk for nutritional deficiencies or foodborne illness, including pregnant women, young children, senior citizens and those who are immunocompromised.  Educational materials must take into consideration such factors as reading ability and language requirements and design preferences.  Determining the most effective communication strategies, e.g., brochures, video, video news releases, public service announcements, and/or web-based, is also critical to effectively conveying the food safety message.
Under FDA?s new Food Protection Plan CFSAN is given major responsibilities for educating consumers and the food industry about prevention of foodborne illness, communicating with the public during food emergencies, and improving the effectiveness of recalls of human and pet food products.
The objective of the contract is to develop educational campaigns and materials covering food safety and nutrition.
The contractor will be required to: 1)  recommend, coordinate, and administer research-based educational strategies to reach particular target audiences or to convey specific messages;  2)  write and/or design materials for review and make changes/corrections based on comments from CFSAN.  This process may take up to three iterations before final work is approved.  These materials include, but are not limited to web content, brochures, press kits, fact sheets, videos, classroom materials, patient handouts, and promotional items; 3) prepare print or audio-visual materials for duplication by delivering finished materials in an appropriate format (i.e., disk, beta-tape, etc.) with all required forms completed and 4) review printing and/or production processes when requested by checking proof sheets or onsite monitoring of the printing process.
Contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation) describing their company?s experience and ability to:  1. Conduct independent education campaigns 2.  Provide information on a broad range of food safety, nutrition, and related public health topics 3. Include target audience analysis and state of the art research methods 4.  Provide details on how the education campaigns were conducted/managed 5.  List experience as a multidisciplinary education campaign organization that covers food safety and nutrition.
An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is expected with a base year with four one year options.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541820 with a size standard of $6.5 million.     Interested offerors must provide (1) company?s name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address, and point of contact (2) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (3)  the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (4) if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages) (submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm?s status); (5)  DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). (6)  Companies must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as a potential source; (7) identification of the firm?s GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are requested and (8) if the company has a government approved accounting system, identify the agency that approved the system.
This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or indication the Government will contract for the work contained in this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<SUBJECT>B -- Copy Testing of Promotional Materials Directed to Consumers and Healthcare Professionals
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FDA-SOL-08-00574
<RESPDATE>040708
<ARCHDATE>04222008
<CONTACT>Megan Gnall, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7167, Fax (301) 827-7103, Email megan.gnall@fda.hhs.gov - Megan Gnall, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7167, Fax (301) 827-7103, Email megan.gnall@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Copy Testing of Promotional Materials Directed to Consumers and Healthcare Professionals for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The role of FDA?s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications (DDMAC) is to protect the public health by assuring prescription drug information is truthful, balanced and accurately communicated. This is accomplished through a comprehensive surveillance, enforcement and education program, and by fostering better communication of labeling and promotional information to both healthcare professionals and consumers.
DDMAC has responsibility for reviewing prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in these promotional materials is not false or misleading. The Division engages in a variety of tasks to perform this responsibility, including: providing written comments to pharmaceutical sponsors on proposed promotional materials to ensure clear and unambiguous communication of the laws and regulations relating to prescription drug promotion; reviewing complaints about alleged promotional violations; initiating enforcement actions on promotional materials that are false or misleading; comparing the product labeling and promotional materials of various closely related products to ensure that the regulatory requirements are consistently and equitably applied; traveling to major medical meetings and pharmaceutical conventions to monitor promotional exhibits and activities; and acting as a liaison between DDMAC and other divisions within the FDA on promotional issues.
The purpose of the contract is to provide DDMAC with the means to obtain, on an as-needed basis, reactions and interpretations regarding questions of immediate concern to the Division.  Copy Test Studies shall focus on target audience?s reactions to advertising materials provided by FDA.  Consumer copy tests will use an Internet testing methodology with a sample projectable to the US population.  Note that simple projection from a small panel sample is not sufficient.  The contractor shall have the means to include individuals who may be economically or socially disadvantaged.  In cases in which FDA is interested in testing consumers who have a relatively rare condition, a screening mechanism may be needed.  Healthcare professional copy tests will use an Internet testing methodology with a sample projectable to the US population of the particular medical specialty of interest (e.g., family practitioners, OB-GYNs).  
The services required of the contractor are essentially those of sample selection, screening, and data collection on a national basis, with the capability of data collection via Internet administration.  The contractor shall pretest and field up to an anticipated five copy tests per year over the five year contract period, using questionnaires developed by DDMAC.  As copy tests shall be conducted in response to irregularly-occurring Agency needs, it shall be necessary for the contractor to have the capability to conduct tests on short notice and at irregularly-occurring intervals.
The contractor will be required to: 1) identify and select samples of target audience respondents appropriate to the topic of each specific copy test; 2) develop Internet-ready materials, stimuli, and programming.  Stimuli may be in audio, video or print format, as needed.  This process may take multiple iterations before final work is approved.; 3) pretest and field the copy test via the Internet with a sample of target audience consumers or healthcare professionals to be approved by FDA; 4) code and enter data, including coding of open-ended questions; 5) deliver electronically to FDA a complete and edited data file compatible with SPSS version 16, including variable titles and value labels as well as other details to ease interpretation, and a methods report describing the sample, weighting, and other variables as needed.
Contractors must submit a capability statement (five pages maximum) describing their company?s experience and ability to:  1. Conduct internet based experimental research, 
2.  Identify and select appropriate samples of consumers and healthcare professionals, including socially and economically disadvantaged consumers, 3. Produce internet-ready questionnaires and stimuli, 4.  Provide data in SPSS compatible format, and 5. List prior experience with experimental research design and study implementation.
An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is expected with a base year with four one year options.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 million. 
Interested offerors must provide (1) company?s name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address, and point of contact (2) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (3)  the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (4) if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages) (submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm?s status); (5)  DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). (6)  Companies must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as a potential source; (7) identification of the firm?s GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are requested and (8) if the company has a government approved accounting system, identify the agency that approved the system.

<CONTACT>Jason V White Contract Specialist (716)862-6004
<DESC>The US Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Medical-Legal Affairs (OMLA), located in Buffalo, NY, is seeking sources for a peer review contract. OMLA reviews approximately 350 paid VA medical malpractice claims annually.  For the majority of these reviews, OMLA employs fee-basis reviewers.  Reviewers requested and assigned through the contracted peer review organization will be used to supplement OMLA's fee-basis reviewers.   These reviews are part of the Department of Veterans Administration's (VA) participation in the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) medical malpractice payment reporting process.  These reviews are conducted on paid VA medical malpractice claims nationwide.  These reviews are limited to the care associated with the paid VA medical malpractice claim allegation. The contractor would be tasked with maintaining a pool of qualified, board-certified physicians who have three continuous years of active practice in the same specialty as the physician reviewed by OMLA.  Reviewers would be drawn from this pool as-needed to supplement reviews in the OMLA office.  The contractor would disseminate information as needed to these candidates, and serve as a central point of contact and intermediary between OMLA and the individual reviewers.  Potential offerors should have knowledge of and experience with medical malpractice claims and reviews, so as to be conversant in the terminology and description of the requirement. The Government is considering the use of an IDIQ contract to allow task orders placed that may include the following services to be performed by reviewers: 1.	Provide a written summary of the provided case as well as an opinion with justification concerning the standard of care rendered and if that care met the standard in effect at the time of the incident 2.	Participate, via phone, in a panel discussion of the reviewed claims 3.	Re-review a previously submitted claim In the event that multiple disciplines are involved in the claim, multiple physicians will be selected from the provided candidate pool by OMLA.   Additionally, OMLA will either provide the peer review organization with the medical records appropriately organized and limited to the care associated with the claim, or the contractor may be required to prepare the records prior to submission to the assigned reviewer.  This preparation may be performed by the physician who will be performing the review, but may be performed by any contractor staff that has completed a Government-initiated background investigation and completed all necessary training as described in the RFP. Various disciplines, across numerous different fields of healthcare, are reviewed by OMLA and therefore would have to be represented by the contractor's pool of candidates. At this time, the purpose of this notice is to identify potential candidates for competition of this requirement.  Interested offerors should respond by email ONLY to Mr. Jason White, Contract Specialist, at Jason.White@VA.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Emails should have the subject line of "Peer Review Contract."  Questions will be taken and sample language from the proposed scope of work can be provided if requested.   This is not a binding request for proposals.  This posting is intended for market research purposes only and may not result in the release of a competitive solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is conducting a market survey to identify potential candidates to develop technologies of advanced  materials that are lightweight and multi-functional applicable in a wide range  of munitions. It is the governmentýýýs intentions to award a sole source  contract to Frontier Performance Polymers Inc. as a follow on effort to prior  and existing projects in the areas of lightweight toughen materials suitable  for ammunition applications that shall survive ballistic and ruggedness  requirements.  The Mortar Ammunition Branch and Composite Material Branch is  looking at highly effective solutions using tailorable materials including  high impact Nylons, impact modified thermoplastics, thermosets, Eutectic  alloys, and Polymers. Solutions shall not be limited by cost-effective  production processes such as metal casting, welding, injection-molded and  compression molded composites. The technologies identified in this material  development shall not degrade the performance specification of the item, in  addition to meeting Insensitive Munitions requirements. The market survey for  this material technologies development shall identify packaging solutions to  enhance the current logistical life cycle of the ammunition item. The existing  packaging container is a multi-layer system consisting of fiber containers  inside an exterior metal container, then placed in a wire bound overpack  necessary to achieve long-term protection to the ammunition against various  rigorous battlefield environments. The current packaged munition would require  two people to handle which fails to meet the 90 lbs maximum ORD (Operational  Requirement Documentation) requirement for a single package mandated by the  soldier. Improving the soldierýýýs ability to carry-out and deploy their mission  is the primary goal to any proposed solution. Interested parties shall include  a brief description of the companyýýýs capabilities including description of  facilities, personnel, manufacturing process, inspection capability, proven  monthly production capacity, environmental compliance relating to the product (s), possible partnering/teaming arrangements; and whether the company is a  small or large business.  All interested sources shall submit details of their  capabilities no later than 15 days from date of publication to U.S. Army  RDECOM-ARDEC, ATTN: Timothy Woo, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Responses  shall be submitted by electronic mail to timothy.woo@us.army.mil. Large files  need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com). This market survey  is for information and planning purposes only; does not constitute a  solicitation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any information submitted shall be provided at no cost to the government. All  information that is Company Proprietary shall be marked to show that content  and shall be held in confidential status.

<SUBJECT>R -- Creation, Maintenance and Distribution of Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Regenstrief Institute, Inc., 410 West 10th Street, Suite 2000, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202-3012 for a multi-year contract to continue the creation of new records, maintenance of existing records, and electronic distribution of Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), a registered trademark of the Regenstrief Institutes, Inc. LOINC is a system for encoding laboratory tests/results and other clinical measures used in electronic transactions between independent computer systems. LOINC is distributed free via the Internet from the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and is also included in NLM's Unified Medical Language System. Metathesaurus.  

The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of LOINC as a freely available and openly developed source of standard identifiers, names, and codes for encoding laboratory tests/results, clinical observations, claims attachments sets, and patient assessment instruments. The development and ongoing maintenance of LOINC was initiated and is directed by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. with advice from the Laboratory and Clinical LOINC Committees consisting of volunteers from academia, industry, and government. LOINC development has been partially supported by private foundation, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (since renamed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), and the National Library of Medicine.  LOINC has been recommended as a U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and is part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications recently released by the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services. LOINC has been specified as one of the standards for the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) initiative developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the standard coding system for segments of the HL7 clinical message standard. It has been proposed as a national standard for use in claims attachments under the Administrative Simplification provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which will require additional expansion of its content.  

Because this coding system is unique and is a proprietary project of the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee, NLM has determined that Regenstrief Institute, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the necessary services, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) - unique supplies or services available from only one source.

This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above may submit a proposal, by the closing date listed above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All proposal submitted from responsible sources will be considered by NLM. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- Automated Aerial Refueling (AAR) Phase II Integrator Industry Day
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Vehicles Directorate, will be hosting an Industry day on 15 -16 Aug 07 at Crowne Plaza Dayton, OH.  The purpose of this industry day is to discuss the AAR Phase II program and address the technical role of AAR Phase II Integrator.  A BAA is anticipated to be released on 5 Oct 07 for the AAR Phase II Integrator.  Information contained in the final BAA synopsis takes precedence over any information that is presented at Industry Day.  

The AAR Phase II program seeks to build upon the success of the AAR Phase I Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The goal of the program is to mature the Phase I ATD technology into a system for automated boom/receptacle refueling.  The AAR Phase II program will use a spiral approach to develop the system.  The first spiral will seek to mature the AAR architecture developed under Phase I which incorporates Internet Protocol (IP)-based communications and relative navigation using Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System(GPS).  For the second spiral, the spiral one architecture should be enhanced to meet AAR requirements during outages or unavailability of GPS measurements.  

The AAR Phase II Integrator would be responsible for the following: interfacing with a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Tanker modified with the Spiral 1 system, integrating the GFE Spiral 1 PGPS system with the appropriate flight controls into a surrogate test vehicle capable of Boom/Receptacle Wet Hookup; developing the system/sub-system performance and technical specification; performing a detailed sensitivity analysis of system performance in offline simulation, building the spiral 2 system by augmenting spiral 1 to meet requirements during outages or unavailability of GPS measurements; and evaluating both the spiral 1 and spiral 2 systems through analysis, simulation, ground and flight testing.   
  
AAR Industry Day will be held at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 33 E. Fifth Street, Dayton Ohio, on 15-16 Aug 2007.  ALL ATTENDEES MUST REGISTER ON THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://aar.azimuth-corp.com.

Attendees should mail or fax (888-281-7614, ATTN: Janet Malone) a signed DD 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement prior to the first day of the conference.  One-on-one sessions will be available from 1500 to 1700 on 15 Aug 2007 and from 0800 to 1700 on 16 Aug 2007.  These sessions will be 45 minutes in duration and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
1.	Background

Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere is now facing the challenge of implementing free and fair municipal elections in November 2008.  USAID is committed to strengthening electoral processes in the country with a strong program supporting transparent election processes, increased and informed voter participation, robust objective oversight, inclusive political party participation and increased civic advocacy.  Recent national activities, however, have revealed a number of flaws in the process of registering voters, a lack of inclusive political party participation and recent government intrusion on civil society activities.

In recognition of the strategic importance of the 2008 municipal elections, USAID/Nicaragua has formed a special Elections Unit consisting of one USPSC Director, a dedicated Foreign Service National (FSN) municipal elections specialist with part time support from other FSN democracy specialists, and other staff to be drawn from other sections as required during the critical run up to the Municipal elections, November, 2008.  USAID/Nicaragua wishes to contract with an individual under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) to serve as Director for the newly formed Elections and Political Processes task force who will be responsible for planning, designing, managing and monitoring USAID-funded Elections and Political Processes (EPP) related activities.  The contract will be for one year.  The contractor will be stationed in Managua, work from the USAID/Nicaragua offices in the USAID compound and travel as necessary outside the capital city.

H047 WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH 10 CFR 851  (FEB 2008)  (a) No work may be performed at the covered workplace unless and until the government approves the contractor's Worker and Safety Health Program. "Covered workplace" means a place at a DOE site where a contractor is responsible for performing work in furtherance of a DOE or NNSA mission. "DOE site" means a DOE-owned or -leased area or location or other area or location controlled by DOE where activities and operations are performed  at one or more facilities or places by a contractor in furtherance of a DOE mission.  (b) The Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, shall comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 851, Worker Safety and Health Program. 10 CFR 851 is incorporated into the contract by reference.  In the event of any conflict between this special contract requirement and 10 CFR 851, the requirements of 10 CFR 851 shall take precedence.  (c) The contractor shall implement and maintain a written Worker and Safety Health Program that provides the methods of implementing the requirements of Subpart C of 10 CFR 851 (or Part 851 or ýý851).  (d) Contractors must incorporate in the Worker and Safety Health Program any changes, conditions, or workplace safety and health standards directed by DOE consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 851 and Laws, Regulations, Directives and NNSA Policy (if in the basic contract) and associated contract clauses.

(h) Nothing in Part 851 or this special contract requirement precludes a contractor from taking any additional protective action that is determined to be necessary to protect the safety and health of workers (see ýý851.12). L027 WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS - ACTIVITY IV  (FEB 2008)  (a) The resulting contract requires performance on a DOE/NNSA site.  When working at a DOE/NNSA site, the offeror, or their subcontractor(s) at any tier, shall comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 851, Worker Safety and Health Program.  The offeror shall develop a written Worker and Safety Health Program that provides the methods of implementing the requirements of Subpart C of 10 CFR 851 (or Part 851 or ýý851). This Worker and Safety Health Program must be submitted with your proposal.  (b) The National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center (NNSA) is committed to providing safe and healthful working conditions for federal and contractor employees.  Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 851 codifies the NNSA safety and health requirements for contractor employees.  In no manner does this guidance replace or limit requirements of the rule, or other contractual requirements ensuring compliance with Federal, State and Local regulations.  (c) This provision identifies contractor safety and health program submittal documents and processes that the NNSA considers appropriate for a graded-approach evaluation of a contractors plan for performing Activity IV, lower hazard work (administrative services) at the Service Center or other DOE/NNSA site operating under a contract awarded by the NNSA.  (d) The contractor must submit a Worker Safety and Health Program (WSHP) protecting workers from the hazards of the workplace.  This can be accomplished using the following specific guidance related to the site specific program or it can be a stand alone corporate WSHP.  In both cases the WSHP is submitted with your proposal.  NNSA will attempt to approve your WSHP before contract award, but if the contract action is awarded before the NNSA approval of the WSHP, work cannot commence at the DOE/NNSA location until NNSA approves your WSHP.  (e) Attesting to follow the cognizant site safety program should streamline the review and approval process.  (f) Site Specific Program: Comply with NNSA implemented site specific worker safety and health program (developed to comply with 29 CFR 1960, Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health Programs and Related Matters.)  (g) The Contractor submitted WSHP will include:   (1) Signature page for use by the Contractor Management (Corporate Officer), Contracting Officer (CO), and Site Office Manager/Head of the DOE/NNSA Field Element.   (2) Executive Summary (e.g., brief summary of work activities, locations, number of personnel)   (3) Contractor attesting that it and its employees will follow the site implemented safety and health program for work done at the NNSA site. Example: "Contractor XXX employees performing work at NNSA site ZZZ will integrate with and follow the NNSA site specific safety and health program."   (4) Description of Company Health and safety organization assigning, goals, clear roles and responsibilities. Also include an equivalent of, "Company XXX retains sole and complete responsibility to continue compliance with other regulations placed upon the contractor through the contract and state, federal and local regulations.  This includes reporting requirements under OSHA.", or "Company XXX designates Person PPP as the safety officer responsible for the employees at the work location. Contact information is ..."   (5) Contractors will explain the review of NNSA site safety and health program to identify contractor employee job training and competency requirements commensurate with the work hazards.   (6) Safety standards and requirements for types of hazards and environment.    (i) Contractors will attend site specific New Employee Orientation as required by the COR.    (ii) All employees have the right and responsibility to stop work if danger to personnel or equipment is imminent.    (iii) Emergency procedures coordinated with those implemented for the location of work.    (iv) Injury and accident reporting procedures occurring at an NNSA site. Example: "The onsite Contractor employee will report accidents, injuries and illness using the site reporting methods.  Additionally, the Company ___ safety officer will provide copies OSHA required reporting data as well as CIARS data as required by DOE Order 231.1 to the Contracting Officer and to the NNSA Safety and Health Office."   (7) Hazard controls.  Contractor will be aware of hazards of their work place/workstation and ensure understanding of site wide methods for its control (usually training).

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code _314912_ assigned to contract number _____________.

(b) Evaluation. The Government?

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and enable it to meet its objectives and mandates, OTI engages and retains the services  high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred to in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

BACKGROUND: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the American Indian/Alaska Native community. Indeed, NARA?s Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, American Indians comprise less than 1 percent of NARA?s workforce.  Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem; Federal agencies must look to alternative sources for American Indian applicants.  

In an effort to meet the expectations set forth in the Strategic Plan, NARA is seeking to partner with an internship organization that can assist NARA in expanding its outreach in the American Indian/Alaska Native community.  Specifically, NARA is seeking assistance in filling five vacant intern positions for the summer 2008.  The internships will focus on locating, researching, and organizing archival documents and records of particular interest to American Indian/Alaska Native communities.  Requirement CLIN 0001 total price for 5 summer interns

The micromirror array is illuminated uniformly at f-number of 2.4 or slower by an illumination system at an angle such that optical axis of the required collimator is normal to the plane of the micromirror array and is telecentric.  The micromirror array consists of a 1024 horizontal x 768 vertical array of micromirrors on a 13.68 micrometer pitch.  The image is displayed by turning the ?on? micromirrors 12 degrees in one direction, and the ?off? micromirrors 12 degrees in the opposite direction, where both of these angles are relative to the optical axis.  The tilt axis is along the diagonal of the micromirrors.  Only light from the ?on? micromirrors enters the collimator when the object-side f-number of the mirror array is 2.4 or slower.  Both the micromirror array and its illumination system are existing equipment and therefore are not part of this requirement, but this information is provided since the requirements depend on it.  The mirror array is 14 mm horizontal and 10.5 mm vertical, giving a diagonal of 17 mm.  The video camera (which is also existing equipment and therefore not part of this requirement) consists of a 640 horizontal x 480 vertical CCD at the focus of a 20 degree, f-number of 3.6 camera lens.  The CCD is of the one-third inch type, such that it is 4.8 mm horizontal and 3.6 mm vertical.  Both the collimator and the camera will be focused at infinity, such that the image displayed on the mirror array (the ?object? position) is demagnified and focused onto the CCD (the ?image? position).  The exit pupil of the collimator will be placed at the entrance pupil of the camera.  Also, the magnification is set such that three micromirror array pixels are projected into each CCD pixel for sampling purposes, and with this demagnification only 25 percent of the CCD will be illuminated at each exposure.  The collimator and camera will be mounted on a vertical-horizontal translation stage (not part of this solicitation) and moved laterally relative to the micromirror array between exposures in order to test the camera over the full field of view.  With this procedure, the 20 degrees field of view of the camera will be tested one quadrant at time.  However, the object field over which the collimator must operate therefore has a diameter of twice the mirror array diameter, which gives 35 mm.  Recognizing that this may be difficult to achieve, vendors are asked to provide two quotes, if possible, one for each of the following options:  Option 1) a collimator designed for testing the camera at 10 degrees (plus or minus 5 degrees from the optical axis) field of view (leading to an object field diameter of 17 mm), and Option 2) a collimator designed for testing the camera at N degrees (plus or minus N/2 degrees from the optic axis) field of view, where N is greater than10 but less than or equal to 20, as described above (with a commensurate increase in object field diameter, to a limit of 35 mm for 20 degrees field of view).  The Optical Collimator shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

1.  Effective Focal Length: 100 mm
2.  Aperture Ratio: f-number of 2.8
3.  There shall be no obscuration over any part of the aperture of the collimator.
4.  Spectral transmittance:  greater than 80 percent at all wavelengths from 380 nm to 1000 nm, and optionally to 2500nm.
5.  Intended maximum object diameter without vignetting:  17 mm (Option 2:  up to 35mm, see Stronger Considerations below).
6.  The distance from the object plane (the micromirror array) to the input edge of the collimator (including the collimator housing and mounts) must be greater than 50 mm in order to provide clearance for the micromirror illumination system.
7.  The exit pupil of the collimator must be accessible such that both its location and diameter can be matched to the location and diameter of entrance pupil of the camera described above, with a standoff distance between the exit principal plane of the collimator and the entrance principal plane of the camera of 100 mm or greater.  The entrance pupil plane of the camera is 75 mm behind the front surface of the camera. To allow for appropriate spacing between the collimator and the camera, the distance between the exit principal plane of the collimator and the output edge of the collimator (including the collimator housing and mounts) must therefore be 25 mm or less, or the standoff distance (and the rest of the system) must grow such that the pupils are matched.
8.  A mounting flange shall be supplied on the collimator for mounting the collimator on top of the user?s translation stage.  This flange shall include at least 2 holes, 1 inch center to center, tapped at least 0.5 inches deep for 1/4-20 (one-quarter inch diameter, 20 threads/inch) bolts.
9.  Imaging quality must be sufficient to resolve a square grid having a pitch of 13.68 micrometers over its object diameter of 17 mm (Option 2:  up to 35mm, see Stronger Considerations below) when placed at the focal plane of the collimator, over the full spectral range, and with distortion less than 2 percent.
10.  Ghost images resulting from inter-reflections should be minimized by either using a mirror-based system or, if a refractive system is proposed, by incorporating optimized antireflection coatings.
11.  Scatter should be minimized by using polished optical surfaces and optimized coatings where needed.
12.  Weight: less than 25 kg.
13.  Overall length: less than 750 mm.
14.  Overall diameter: less than 300 mm.

Warranty:  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-08-2-0011
<RESPDATE>051408
<ARCHDATE>07132008
<CONTACT>Elizabeth A. Jackson, (757) 878-2100
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Section I.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Research & Development as described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidel ines set forth herein. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: The Army is  anticipating the development of a new centerline turboshaft engine for use in future manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of the Future Force. The Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) program, a 7000 horsepower full engine demonstrator, will be co nducted under the DOD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program and will consist of a 4 year technical effort beginning in FY12 to demonstrate the VAATE phase III turboshaft/turboprop goal. The FATE program goals will be to demo nstrate a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a design life of 6000 hrs in a 7000 hp turboshaft engine.  In order to meet the aggressive goals of  the FATE program, significant advancements in gas generator turbine technology will be required. The aggressive performance goals of the FATE dictate the need for advanced material and cooling systems in order to achieve the cycle temperatures and cooling  reductions required.  These conditions create significant challenges for components in the gas generator turbine of the FATE engine.   Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop critical advanced material, manufacturing, and/or cooling te chnology for the gas generator turbine that possess the combination of performance, durability, and affordability necessary to enable FATE technology level turboshaft engines to achieve their performance, cost, and durability/life goals.  The offeror must substantiate how the proposed technology efforts are critical to their planned FATE configuration.  The period of performance for this program is approximately 43 months.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: It is the Government's desire to conduct a technology develop ment effort focused on advanced materials, manufacturing, and/or cooling technology in the gas generator turbine for FATE technology level turboshaft engines. The program shall utilize a notional FATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational r equirements and potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the FATE engine performance, cost, and durability/life goals.  The notional FATE engine should be a free shaft engine and designed to achieve the following goals that are based on a con figuration that does not include a reduction gearbox but does include an inlet particle separator: .32  Specific Fuel Consumption (based on 7000 SHP engine @ SLS, IRP point); 9.7  Horsepower to Weight ratio @ IRP (7000 shaft horsepower); greater than or eq ual to 6000 hours life, 15000 cycles cold parts, 7500 cycles for turbine blades and combustor liners (to crack initiation); 125 $/HP  per engine production cost (including control system and IPS); 45% Reduction in maintenance cost in $ per engine flight ho ur (relative to offerors proposed baseline); 20% Reduction in development cost (relative to offerors proposed baseline); Efficient operation at part power is desired. Note:  For engine level goals:  specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight, and li fe are weighted higher than development, production, and maintenance cost. The offeror shall define the anticipated gas generator turbine configuration and performance characteristics consistent with their FATE design.  The offeror shall design, fabricate and perform validation testing of the proposed gas generator turbine technologies considered critical to their envisioned FATE goal achievement.  Validation tes ting shall be conducted at the bench and/or rig level in an environment that simulates notional FATE engine operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynamic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance. The Advanced Gas Generator Turbine Te chnology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation.   DELIVERABLES:   The agreement awarded under this solicitation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan (delivered as part of the first bi-monthly cost and performance report), (2) Design Re view Briefing Charts, (3) Test Plans, (4) Test Reports, (5) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (6) Final Report, (7) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis shall be presented.  All deliverable data may be in the format of selected recipient..  Sectio n II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is 43 months total with 40 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. The Government funding f or the program is $1.4M distributed by fiscal year as follows: FY08-09-300K, FY10-350K, FY11-500K, FY12-250K.  TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  Due to the commercial application of this technology, the Government anticipates an award of a TIA (Cooperative Agre ement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the pro ject to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation of 50% are anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit f rom commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R 37. accessible at the following link:  http://ww w.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r37p.pdf.

Offerors are urged to ensure that their proposals are submitted on the most favorable terms in order to reflect  their best possible potential. The Government intends to make an award without discussions based upon initial proposals received but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary.  Award of this contract will go to the offeror wh o offers the best overall value to the Government.  Offerors could, for example, be awarded the contract without receiving the highest technical rating.  Offerors will be evaluated on their technical approach (Factor One), their management capability (Fact or Two), the companys past performance (Factor Three) and the price for implementation (Factor Four). Evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance and each of these factors is significantly more important than the past performance factor.  All sub-factors are of equal importance.   The Government will evaluate offerors proposals using adjectival ratings.   FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH FACTOR   a. O fferors shall submit written data to support their understanding of the requirement and the proposed means of fulfilling the requirement.  Offerors should provide a complete narrative for each element listed under the Technical Approach Sub factors as stat ed below.  NOTE:  Statements that the Offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient and could render the proposal as unacceptable.  Subfactor 1:  Experience of Personnel:     (1) Demonstrate expertise and experience of personnel proposed to perform the services. Offerors will only submit one resume pe r proposed position.  Subfactor 2 Knowledge of Services:    (1) Describe contracts or experience with other organizations that reflect your ability to provide the tasks and services identified in the contract Performance Work Statement. <BR>FACTOR 2 - MANA GEMENT CAPABILITY FACTOR  a. Offerors will demonstrate their ability to provide a reasonable number of personnel, with sufficient training, to provide all the tasks and services identified in the overall Performance Work Statement.  FACTOR 3 - PAST PERFOR MANCE FACTOR   a. Offerors should be able to show how they have successfully executed similar work. Contractor should be able to show what separates their company from potential competitors.  Lack of past performance will receive a rating as neutral, havin g no favorable or unfavorable impact on the evaluation. All pertinent past performance should be included. However, as a minimum, list relevant projects, current or completed within the past five years that best demonstrate your relevant past performance w ith this type of work.  Include dates, location, types of contract, dollar values, description of the work, and references.  Reference Information should include the name, address, fax number and telephone number of the Contracting Officer or other contrac t administrator.  References should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractors to be used.  Attached is a Past Performance Questionnaire. This questionnaire is to be filled out by a minimum of three (3) different references for the potential offer ors past performance and provided back to the government with their proposal. Past performance shall be provided for companies with similar size and similar scope.   FACTOR 4  PRICE FACTOR   a. This factor will be evaluated on the degree to which the prop osed cost/price elements are consistent with the work to be performed. Significantly unbalanced cost/price may be deemed to indicate a lack of understanding of the scope of work or level of technical expertise required. Prices will be evaluated for the full term of the contract.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  STATEMENT OF WORK<BR>Flame Resistant (FR) Marine Corps Combat Ensemble Burn Testing<BR>24 Feb 08<BR><BR>1. Objective<BR><BR>The overall objective of this effort is to determine the variou s materials resistance to a four and six second simulated flash fire exposure.  The test results will be used to measure the relative FR protection of numerous FR combat ensembles and fabric configurations.  In addition testing of the current Marine Corps  (MC) Flame Resistant Organizational Clothing (FROG) will also be conducted.<BR><BR>2. Background<BR><BR>FR items were identified as a requirement through a Universal Need Statement (UNS) and an Urgent Statement of Need (USON) for future MC procurements. These items provide incremental FR protection for Marines in theater.  FROG items include the FR combat ensemble (shirt & trousers), long sleeve t-shirts, balaclavas, and gloves.<BR><BR>The FR combat ensemble will provide an increased degree of protection most needed for our Marines and Sailors against a broad spectrum of environmental, occupational, and battlefield hazards, while offering them added protection against heat exhaustion with moisture wicking and quick drying capabilities.  The combat ensemble  will also provide the necessary protection, safety, and comfort features required by the Marine Corps.  <BR>As a continuous effort to improve the FR combat ensemble performance, prototype garments will be tested and evaluated as they become available.<BR> <BR>3. Task Description<BR><BR>3.1 Fabrics<BR><BR>The fabrics that could potentially be evaluated may include modacrylic, rayon, wool, cotton, Nomex, PBI.  It is expected that fabric construction will be similar to those used in the current FR combat ensem ble.  These fabrics will self-extinguish and will not melt or drip.  We do not know the exact fabric details at this time.<BR><BR>3.2 Uniforms<BR><BR>Candidate fabrics will be constructed into the FR combat ensemble design for flash fire testing.<BR><BR>3. 3 Flash Fire Testing<BR><BR>A four second and six second simulated flash fire exposure using procedures in ASTM F 1930 Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection Against Flash Fire Simulations Using an Instrumented Manik in will be used to determine the various materials resistance.  Testing will be conducted both initially and after 25 launderings.  All garments to be tested will be size medium regular.  All garments will be provided to the contractor in an unwashed cond ition.  The contractor will be responsible for accomplishing the 25 launderings required as a condition to flash fire testing.<BR><BR>4. Program Management<BR><BR>The contractor shall designate a single individual to serve as the primary point of contact f or the government.  This individual shall be responsible for the coordination of all communication, have the authority to commit the contractor, and accept direction from the contracting officer.  This individual shall be responsible for bringing to the co ntracting officers attention any problems that could impact performance cost or schedule in a timely manner.<BR><BR>A Post Award Conference may be held within 30 days of contract award if deemed necessary by the government.  In Process Reviews shall also be held at the testing facility if deemed necessary by the Government.<BR><BR>The contractor shall support teleconferences with the Government to coordinate progress and resolve program issues.  The contractor shall support the Government visiting the test ing facilities at the start of, during, and at the conclusion of all testing.<BR><BR>5. Deliverables<BR><BR>A final test report to include a report, pictures, a nd video shall be submitted NLT 10 days after conclusion of a test event.<BR><BR>6. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)<BR><BR>The Government will provide all FR combat ensembles for flash fire simulation testing.<BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <BR>Proposals are due on April 10, 2008, 10:00 a.m. See Section entitled Proposal Submission for more details. <BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE FOR TALENT MATURITY ASSESSMENT (TMA)<BR><BR>B ackground<BR><BR>In February 2007 the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (DUSA) shared a vision to establish an Army Civilian University (ACU).  At its core is the ACUs mission to create a network of schools and colleges that effectively cultivates our es sential civilian personnel resource.  This university model will be designed to maximize civilian career development opportunities through a transformational model of effective and efficient learning opportunities that strengthen the Armys Goals and Missi on in support of our National Security.  The ACU is responsible for overseeing the analysis and evaluation of current programs involving Army civilian leadership, professional development, and education/training while molding structure into a university le arning concept to meet future learning and knowledge management challenges.  <BR><BR>In order to establish an effective ACU program and to ensure Civilian leader development, the Army needs to define current and future competencies; this means defining, me asurable skills, knowledge, abilities, qualities, and values required in both technical and leader functions. As part of this process, the Army requires contractor subject matter expertise to conduct a Talent Maturity Assessment (TMA) of Army civilian pers onnel.  <BR><BR>Scope:<BR><BR>Provide contract consultant support to assist DUSA in obtaining TMA of Army civilian personnel. This will contribute to ability of the emerging Army Civilian University (ACU) to use the analytical results of this assessment as  the basis for developing a Human Capital Strategic Plan and a Talent Management Action Plan. In particular, the contractor will deliver: <BR><BR>"	TMA with conclusions and recommendations completed within 90 days ADC<BR>"	Results compared and contrasted t o other Government and Industry data points to enrich the analysis<BR>"	Comparisons provided to best-practice of commercial and government organizations <BR><BR><BR>Statement of Objectives:<BR><BR>Phase I. Interview with top leaders (roughly 10-15) of Army  Civilian Corps to determine common threads of research topics. Review and consolidate the results from previous civilian surveys. Determine what shortfalls have been found and conduct a trend analysis on similar questions over time. In addition, conduct r esearch on which questions from the existing TMA database need to be revised to reflect familiar terms to Army civilian personnel. Work with ASA (M&RA) and G1 to add up to 5 questions that are deemed necessary to conduct a thorough maturity assessment. Det ermine which groups should participate in the e-focus groups so that insights gathered will be most representative of the entire population. Conduct external research on the related areas of interest to Army civilian personnel leaders at G1 and ASA (M&RA). <BR><BR>Phase II. Conduct a web-administered survey and focus groups. In conjunction with the Army Research Institute, survey enough appropriated-funds civilian personnel across Army to ensure 5% (roughly 15,000) successful respondents. Conduct 8-12 e-focu s groups from various representative groups of Army civilian personnel.<BR><BR>Phase III. Based on results from initial interviews, surveys and focus groups, conduct deep dive, internal research on specific topics of interest.  Determine the most likely ca uses of the results and any causal linkages to existing civilian personnel structures. Compare the survey and focus group results to best practices in industry and government organizations. Build the Talent Maturity analyses.<BR><BR>Phase IV. Write a comprehensive research report with all interview, focus group and survey results. Decompose survey results by Major Command, pay grade, civilian career field, and up  to two additional characteristics. Distribute this report on AKO within 90 days ADC.  Results should be prepared in the following 14 categories: Overall Talent Maturity, Leadership Commitment to Talent, Human Capital Plan, Workforce Planning, Talent Acqui sition, Talent Engagement, Talent Development, Talent Deployment, Talent Management, Performance Management, Leadership Development, Talent Retention, Organizational Accountabilities and Innovation. Benchmark the results against commercial and government b est practices.<BR><BR>Period and Place of Performance:<BR><BR>All performance under this contract to include identified deliverables shall be completed with 90 days after award.  Primary place of performance is the contractors location.  Workspace, as app licable, will be provided when contractor performance is required at Government locations.<BR><BR>Travel:<BR>Some travel maybe required in order to perform contract requirements. Travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations and  FAR 31.205-46.  However, local travel will not be reimbursed. For estimation purposes, assume 5 or 6 trips for 2 people, 2-days each. The Not To Exceed amount for travel is $15,000.00.<BR><BR>For the combined synopsis/soliciation package please go to http s://eoaa.hqda.pentagon.mil/upload_dccw/securitylogin.asp.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the various software products used in the Department of Stateýs Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing from HL Group, Inc. an extended warranty for Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft (DCA/PS), Asset Advantage terminal licenses and ongoing custom development and tailoring related to these software products.  I further recommend that warranty, licenses and ongoing technical support services be purchased for a base year and for two option years. The subject action would be a new contract.  Previously, the purchase of products and services from HL Group has been undertaken by Accenture, a contractor retained by the Department of State to design, develop and deploy the Department's Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS).  It is in the best interests of the State Department to directly purchase the software licenses as well as the warranties, service and support agreements essential to the ongoing operation of ILMS.  It is contemplated that this will be accomplished by means of a firm fixed price contract.   As it is currently designed and configured, ILMS requires the following: a.	Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft b.	Advantage Asset Terminal Licenses  c.	Loftware LPS Enterprise Edition; and  Custom Development & Tailoring  The accomplishment of this procurement action without undertaking full and open competition is justified by the fact that there is only one responsible source for these products and services -- there are no other suppliers or services that will satisfy the State Department's requirements.  The statutory authority is found in 41 USC 253(c) (1) and in FAR 6.302-1.<BR><BR>The products and services that are to be purchased from HL Group are crucial to the ongoing operation of the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS).  ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, Accenture selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by HL Group.  ILMS will not function without these components. Specifically, the Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft (DCA/PS) software application that is utilized in ILMS is the only certified bar code solution for use with PeopleSoft Inventory, Manufacturing and Purchasing. It was a joint development effort between PeopleSoft and HighJump Software (formerly known as Data Collection Systems, Inc.) It is re-certified with every release of PeopleSoft applications. HL Group has a contract with HighJump Software as its sole distributor of DCA/PS for the government market The Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft and the Asset Advantage software modules utilized in ILMS are customized off-the-shelf software. The software and the customizations have been developed solely by HighJump Software, LLC and HL Group.  Maintenance support or modifications to the software by any third party was specifically prohibited under the terms of the design and development contracts executed by  HL Group and Accenture (operating as the State Department's contractor for the design, development and deployment of ILMS).<BR><BR>Now that ILMS is fully deployed, it is desirable that the State Department take over the various license and support agreements underlying ILMS.  This will lessen the Department's reliance on Accenture for ongoing maintenance and support of ILMS and the risk that accompanies such reliance.  Although it would theoretically be possible to hire another contractor recreate the design and development work that was previously undertaken jointly by HighJump Software and PeopleSoft, such an effort would be lengthy, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for licenses and support.  Moreover, a decision not to procure licenses and support from HL Group would have an immediate adverse impact, disabling major components of ILMS.  This acquisition will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is anticipated that, due to the factors described above, there will be little or no competition for this acquisition. The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable. Market research indicates that there are no commercial or nondevelopmental items that would satisfy the State Department's needs.   The software and support services provided were specifically designed to perform crucial functions within the existing production version of ILMS.  The overriding need for software components and support services that do not compromise ILMS functionality cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of commercial or nondevelopmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software customization and support  contracts that it executed with HL Group. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components.  The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
