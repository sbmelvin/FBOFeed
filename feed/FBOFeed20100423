<DESC>The Space Fence (formerly Air Force Space Surveillance System S-Band Radar) program provides a radar system operating in the S-band frequency range to replace the AFSSS VHF "Fence" radar that currently performs detection of orbiting space objects. The Space Fence will have a modern, net-centric architecture that is capable of detecting much smaller objects in low/medium Earth orbit (LEO/MEO). The system will operate with greater accuracy and timeliness to meet warfighter requirements for Space Situational Awareness. ESC is conducting a preliminary design phase starting in early FY11, followed by a production and fielding phase expected to begin in late FY12. Delivery of the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is expected in FY15.

<SUBJECT>U.S. Participation in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012
<SOLNBR>ED-IES-10-R-0031
<RESPDATE>051410
<CONTACT>Joseph S. Gibbs, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 245-6016, Email joseph.gibbs@ed.gov - Sylvia Reid, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-245-6214, Email sylvia.reid@ed.gov
<DESC>The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about May 17, 2010. The Government requires a contract to implement US participation in PISA 2012. PISA is a system of international assessments that focus on 15-year-olds' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every three years. PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of mandatory schooling. <br />PISA is organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of industrialized countries, and was administered for the first time in 2000. PISA is steered by the PISA Governing Board (PGB), comprising representatives from the OECD member countries, and implemented internationally by a consortium of organizations contracted by the OECD.  For PISA 2012, the OECD has contracted with a consortium led by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) to oversee the international development and coordination of the study.  In the Statement of Work (SOW), all mention of relevant international contractors, organizations, or sponsors refer to these institutions. Each country appoints a National Project Manager (in the United States this is a representative from NCES) to manage the study in the country. PISA was implemented in 43 countries in 2000, in 41 countries in 2003, 58 countries in 2006, and 66 countries in 2009. More information on PISA can be found at http://www.pisa.oecd.org and http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa.
<p>The overall goal of this procurement is data collection in the US for PISA 2012 that meets all international and NCES guidelines and which results in the timely availability of high-quality internationally comparable assessment data. Furthermore, PISA 2012 shall result in one or more publications that report on US data and the international comparisons from the perspective of an American constituency. <br />The contractor will follow the established design and standards for PISA 2012, as set forth by the OECD. These design and standards will cover, but are not limited to, administration procedures, sampling guidelines and requirements, survey instruments, data collection, data coding and processing.  The OECD and international contractors also establish the overall study schedule and key deadlines to which the U.S. data collection activities must adhere. The contractor shall follow the international guidelines for PISA 2012 and shall meet established NCES standards and procedures. NCES standards can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/.</p>
<p>NCES is the sole authority to manage PISA in the US and to negotiate with the OECD on any issues related to the study. The contractor shall not use PISA instruments or any part of the PISA instruments for any other purposes without the written consent of the COR. Under no circumstances shall the contractor conduct any activities related to PISA, including conducting the assessment in sub-national jurisdictions, without permission from the COR. The contractor shall not disseminate the PISA data to any entity without written permission from the COR.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) currently occupies 1,727 contiguous rentable square feet (rsf) of office and related space in a building in Pierre, South Dakota. The FBI intends to award a succeeding lease using other than full and open competition to the incumbent lessor for this office space. The lease term is anticipated to be for seven (7) months through 12/31/2010.
<p>The FBI will consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The space must be approximately 1,727 contiguous rentable square feet (rsf) of office space and be available for occupancy by June 1, 2010. The delineated area is within the central business district of Pierre, South Dakota.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include: On-site reserved parking for six (6) cars; special electrical requirements;<br />and security requirements.</p>
<p><br />The FBI&lsquo;s market survey found there was no potential location (other than the existing lessor) in the delineated area with the available contiguous rentable square feet (rsf) of office space needed. To facilitate compliance with GSAM Section 570.402-2 entitled Publicizing/Advertising, the FBI is publicizing its requirement in this advertisement. The FBI will use the information it receives to this advertisement to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the FBI will develop a cost-benefit analysis that will consider among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the FBI's requirement, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Sharon K. Starkey, Contracting Officer<br />935 Pennsylvania Avenue,NW, Room 10254<br />Washington, DC 20535<br />Telephone: 202-324-0564<br />Fax: 202-324-0570<br />Email: Sharon.starkey@ic.fbi.gov</p>
<p>Expression of interest must be submitted to the above by 5:00pm est. on April 30, 2010, and must include the following information:</p>
<p>&#9642;Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.</p>
<p>&#9642;Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.</p>
<p>&#9642;ANSI/BOMA Office area (ABOA) square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate included an amount for tenant improvement and state the amount, if any.</p>
<p>&#9642;Date of space availability.</p>
<p>&#9642;Method of rental space measurement.</p>
<p>&#9642;Building ownership information.</p>
<p>&#9642;Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate included the cost of the required Government parking, if any.</p>
<p>&#9642;Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.</p>
<p>The FBI's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based on the cost-benefit analysis and in part on the information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>NASA has a requirement to extend its Safety and Mission Assurance Support Services(S&MASS) Contract NNJ06JE86C at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a period of 1-year,with two- 6 month options. The S&MASS contract began May 1, 2006 and is currentlyscheduled for completion on April 30, 2011. NASA intends to extend the period ofperformance through April 30, 2012. Exercise of both options would extend performancethrough April 30, 2013. The S&MASS contract provides engineering services supporting the JSC Safety and MissionAssurance Directorate. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from ScienceApplication International Corporation (SAIC), the S&MASS current contractor. Theprocurement will be supported by a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competitionpursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). SAIC has unique knowledgeof all Programs that the S&MA Directorate supports and is able to provide continuedservices without unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Currently SAIC provides support to the Space Shuttle Program, the International SpaceStation, the Constellation Program and the Extravehicular Project Office through safety,reliability, maintainability, quality engineering, quality assurance, software assurance,risk management and technology assurance disciplines. In addition, the S&MASS Contractprovides assurance engineering support to the development of all of JSCs GovernmentFurnished Equipment. The Receiving Inspection and Testing Facility is also a part of theS&MASS Contract. The current capabilities include mechanical, chemical and electricaltesting. The facility specializes in fastener testing, wire/cable certification andelectronic component evaluation for JSC programs and projects. Additionally, the S&MASSContract provides pressure systems technical expertise and manages the pressure systemscertification program for both the JSC and the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico. Due to uncertainties with the Constellation Program, potential changes in theInternational Space Station functionality and undefined requirements for new Programs,NASA is unable to develop requirements for a new contract or to bound the scope andindependent government estimate for a competition. This extension will allow foradditional time for new programs to be defined and existing programs to stabilize.  A newsource evaluation activity will be initiated once the implications of these changes areassessed.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications and approach inwriting to the identified point of contact no later than 3:30 p.m. local time on May 7,2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact SAIC directly. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Laboratory Corporation of America, to investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of CD25-blocking therapies in high inflammatory multiple sclerosis (HI-MS).  The secondary goal of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of CD25-blocking therapies in HI-MS.  The purpose of these send-out research labs is to link the more limited research data (collected through these shared send-out research labs) performed on large number of patients in multicented trials with more extensive MOA research data generated by NIB investigators.  The hope is that this clinical will: 1) define and subsequently validate biomarkers predictive of clinical efficacy of CD25-blocking agents in MS disease activity and disability, 2) define biomarkers predictive of side effects (and thus will help to select out patients who may be at high risks of side-effects) and 3) define entire MOA of CD25-blocking agents on the human immune system.  Because of the entire purpose for the send-out research tests to be acquired under NIB protocol T-N1335 is to assure compatibility with the send-out research tests acquired under multicentric ongoing and planned Phase II/III trails sponsored by Biogen/Facet, NIB has to utilize the identical pre-specified laboratory (i.e. Esoterix) as Biogen/Facet utilizes for all DAC HY P clinical trials. This is the only known source to provide current research data.  The period of performance will be April 30, 2010-May 31, 2013.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1569785 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement for two (2) vessels to conduct a bottom trawl survey of the groundfish resources of the continental shelf and slope of the United States West Coast region. Two commercial trawl-fishing vessels will be chartered to carry out this survey, operating in tandem. The two vessels will commence survey operations on or around August 16, 2010 and conclude survey operations approximately 74 days later on or around October 28, 2010. The charters will begin and end in Newport, Oregon, with survey operations proceeding from North to South. Each vessel will conduct an independent survey of the shelf and slope zone from 30 fathoms to 700 fathoms, extending from the Canadian border around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, California. Survey stations will be designated in the sampling manual to representatively sample this range of depths, and will be randomly pre-selected within a geographical area and depth strata. Both of the vessels will be allocated approximately 200 of these stations. This is to be a one-year contract with three additional one-year options (four years total). The vessel must be at least 65 feet in registered length. It must be seaworthy and suitable for trawling operations in the above region during the season indicated. The vessel's main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower of 450 and not rated more than 1200 horsepower.

The vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of at least 8 knots in low sea states. The vessel must allow for thru-hull cabling for acoustic transducers that will be installed in dry dock. For vessels that do not have a steel hull, complete drawings of the location for transducer placement and any other necessary modifications to ensure hull integrity should be included in the proposal submission. At the end of charter period, transducers will be removed and the perforation will be doubly secured. The vessel must be equipped with a railing with a working height (from deck boards to top of rail) of no less than 40 inches (OSHA). Vessels with a working rail height exceeding 48 inches will be required to provide an overboard chute, or another means to discard fish overboard. The vessel must have clean and sanitary living conditions and adequate berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and four (4) scientists. A suitable desk, table, counter, or other work surface (approximately 4' X 3') must be available within the vessels' bridge where the scientific staff can set up the trawl instrumentation receiver, its display unit, gyrocompass, portable computer, and an external computational storage facility for logging trawl performance data and catch data. A stable source of 110 V, 60 cycle AC power must be available nearby as well as a convenient and accessible storage space for tools, notebooks, sampling forms and other frequently needed equipment and supplies.

The Contractor will consult with the COR to determine the best approach to preservation and conservation treatment.  Using this information along with the completed Object Examination Reports, the Contractor will prepare written Proposals for Treatment for each object. Drawings or illustrations may be included to aid with the description of proposed treatment. Enough detail of methods and materials will be included in each Proposal for Treatment to support peer review by National Park Service (NPS) Conservators at conservation centers and laboratories. Object Examination Reports and Proposals for Treatment shall be submitted to the COR within thirty (30) working days of the Contractor's departure from the McLoughlin House with the objects. The COR will coordinate peer review of the treatment proposals by appropriate specialists.  Once the proposals have been accepted in writing, the Contractor will proceed with the treatments. The Contractor will photo-document each object before, during and after treatment.  An Object Treatment Report will be written for each object treated, including in the description all the techniques and exact materials used. Treated objects will be picked up from and returned to the COR at the McLoughlin House, 713 Center Street, Oregon City, Oregon. All Object Examination Reports, Object Treatment Proposals, and Object Treatment Reports will conform to the standards set forth in the NPS Museum Handbook and Appendices.  These standards are available on the web at http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html. 
All written deliverables will be provided to the COR as hard copy in addition to electronic format accessible by Microsoft Office '97-2003. Photo-documentation shall consist of either 35 mm original prints or minimum 300 dpi digital images printed on quality photographic paper.  The Contractor will not undertake any treatments of the objects until the Reports and Proposals are peer-reviewed and a plan of work has been completed and approved.  Once a plan is agreed upon, object treatments may commence.  The Contractor will perform no actions without CO approval. The Contractor shall keep close contact with the COR at all times.  Any deviations from the plan of work shall be presented to the CO in writing and work shall not proceed until alternatives are determined and agreed upon. In performing this work, the Contractor agrees to be guided by the overall principles and practices outlined in the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the American Institute for Conservation. Treatments will provide for no information loss and will not modify the original character of the objects. Under this work-for-hire, all copyrighted works and the copyrights to those works created as part of this contract belong to the National Park Service.  NPS reserves the right to peer review and make available to the public any/all documentation produced, including photographs. The Contractor will complete a thorough examination object by object and prepare Object Examination Reports and Object Treatment Proposals, detailing precisely what treatments are recommended. Following acceptance of these deliverables, the COR will work with the Contractor and other specialists to finalize a plan of work for treatments.  The Contractor may proceed with treatments when approved in writing by the CO. The final step will be for the Contractor to deliver the treated objects to the McLoughlin House along with the object treatment reports.  When all deliverables and treated objects are accepted by the COR and the CO, the contract work will be completed. In summary, in addition to the treated objects, the Contractor will provide to the COR (deliverables): One Object Examination Report for each object, One Proposal for Treatment for each object, One completed Object Treatment Report for each treated object along with photo-documentation before, during and after treatment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Work under this task order contract will support the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and specifically the Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy&rsquo;s (DALTCP), planning, policy research, and evaluation activities. DALTCP is responsible for the development, coordination, research, and evaluation of Health and Human Service (HHS)/ Office of Secretary (OS) policies and programs that support the independence, productivity, health and security of people with disabilities, including children, working age adults, and older persons. DALTCP is also the lead office within HHS/OS for policy research and analysis related to international disability, aging issues, and long-term care. Within the Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy and Data Analysis ID/IQ task order contract, the Contractor shall provide expertise in policy development and analysis; demonstration and evaluation design; program assessment and evaluation; and data infrastructure development and modeling. In conjunction with these services, the Contractor shall provide organizational and logistical support for conferences, meetings, and other events to assist in the development and dissemination of the deliverables produced under this ID/IQ. Logistical support may entail making travel arrangements, securing hotel accommodations and meeting space, editing and report formatting, and providing technical expertise in support of conferences (e.g., agenda setting, recruitment of expert presenters, and preparation of conference papers and materials). An individual delivery order may require expertise in only one area of expertise or a combination of areas. This will be a multiple award contract. The duration of this contract is anticipated to be five years. The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available through the internet at www.fedbizopps.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Contractors are encouraged to sign-up, on the fedbizopps.gov website, for email notification of all actions relevant to this solicitation, and on the interested vendors list, also listed at the bottom of this announcement. The anticipated date for release of a solicitation is approximately 15 days from the date of this notice. No questions will be entertained at this time. Once the solicitation is released, offerors will be given an opportunity to ask questions and answers will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC><p>United States Government Seeks Sources for Lease of Warehouse and Related Space in Prince George's County, Maryland.&nbsp; The requirement is for an existing lease that is expiring.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The Government is seeking to enter into a lease net of electrical services for approximately 43,000 ANSI/BOMA rentable square feet (BRSF) of contiguous warehouse space, available for use by the Government.&nbsp; The requirement includes general office, warehouse and related space for a five (5) year firm term.&nbsp; The offered building must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. Ceiling height of at least 20 feet clear;<br />2. Parking for 16-20 people, with secured parking for two (2) additional trucks;<br />3. Three (3) loading docks; one with self-leveler that can accommodate a 53' tractor-trailer.</p>
<p>LOCATION: The unique facility must be located in Suburban Maryland, within the delineated area bound by the following:</p>
<p>North: Capital Beltway (I-495) <br />East: Capital Beltway (I-495)<br />South: Pennsylvania Avenue (Route 4)<br />West: Baltimore Washington Parkway (295) and Kenilworth Avenue</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed rental term shall be for five (5) years firm.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: Space must be existing and ready for occupancy no later than July 1, 2010.<br />The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing space or to relocate to alternative space. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs associated with moving. These costs include, but are not limited to, physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications, security infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime and the impact of a move on the agency's mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.&nbsp; In no event shall a potential Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.&nbsp; Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Available square footage (ANSI/BOMA Office Area, rentable and usable);<br />3. Schedule for completion and occupancy date;<br />4. Rental rate information quotation per rentable square foot for a net of electrical services lease for a five (5) year firm term;<br />5. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />6. Site Plan showing parking spaces, loading areas, and vehicular circulation;<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 4:00 pm on May 7, 2010 to: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite #620<br />McLean, VA&nbsp; 22102<br />ATTN: Leroy W.

Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, and Performance Specification. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same.<BR><BR>The Army is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available commercial products and technologies that are capable of providing Enhanced Automated Detection Capability (EADC) for the current fleet of Base Expeditionary Target Surveillance System-Combined (BETSS-C) systems. The Army is primarily interested in products with technologically mature sensor systems and/or a commercial off the shelf (COTS) sensor solutions consisting of hardware, firmware, and software that will provide day/night visibility with Automated Detection features that enhance the Armys Information, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolio, can be put into service with minimal training, and increases operator effectiveness.  Salient and desired characteristics of the EADC system include:  A minimum 360 degree electro-optic and infrared automated detection with a scan elevation of minus 30 to positive 60 degrees from a horizontal installation point; Sensor capable of providing ADC out to 13 kilometers in a day/night environment with audio and visual alarms (alerts) to prompt slew-to-cue of primary sensor to area of interest or to an area of interest identified by the operator; Scan rate adequate to detect changes and provide alerts that allow other sensors to assess of moving personnel and vehicles within the detection area; Scan area selectable by the user (azimuth and elevation) to optimize the detection scan to the surrounding terrain, to filter out high traffic areas or areas under continuous surveillance by other systems, and to focus detection scan on areas of interest; and, No operational radio frequency or laser light emitting devices active in the configuration.  Preferred mounting of sensor would be to existing BETSS-C or Legacy Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) 80 or 107 foot tower, but is not required. The system must be operable by a skill level 1 soldier that has some knowledge/training of ISR equipment currently fielded in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of operation. In the event the Army determines that commercial solutions are feasible, it will be necessary to assess industrys ability to commence high rate monthly production within 3 months from contract award leading to delivery and platform installation of a notional quantity of 100 or more systems on or before the end of Fiscal Year 2011.<BR><BR>Interested sources are requested to provide complete descriptions of existing products or products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above. Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that their system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness.  Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact high rate production in an accelerated environment. Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments. Industry responses should also include projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices assuming a notional 1 November 2010 award date. <BR><BR>Responses to this RFI are due by 1700 hours on 30 April 2010. Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to Raef Schmidt at Raef.Schmidt@us.army.mil.   All material submitted in response to this market survey must be unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing: 1. Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets; 2. Technical and management approach for executing a BETSS-C EADC to include a detailed design; procurement of subsystems and components and the integration of sensor components onto existing RAID towers; rigorous contractor  test and integration data; supporting technical documentation; and, operation and sustainment considerations; 3. A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to meet or exceed the notional requirements outlined above; 4. A supporting program schedule that represents a low risk approach to meeting the objectives outlined above; 5. An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches; and, 6. Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information.<BR><BR>Commencing mid May 2010, the Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the governments feasibility assessment.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 2 hours and will be held at Fort Belvoir or Fort Monroe, VA.  <BR><BR>Additionally, the government may allow interested parties an opportunity to provide a demonstration of their EADC solution integrated onto a government provided tower in a field environment. It is anticipated that the demonstrations would take place at Ft. Huachuca, AZ over a 3 day period in the late July to mid-August 2010 timeframe. Participation in this demonstration will be entirely voluntary and any expense associated with a decision to participate will be borne entirely by the company. All participants in the demonstration must be US citizens and have at a minimum, a SECRET security clearance.  Prior to the demonstration, participants will need to provide a one day training session for operators of the sensor and will be required to execute a product demonstration liability disclaimer. At its sole discretion the government may provide participants with an informal written assessment of the capabilities demonstrated during this phase of the market research. The Government will not provide a full system capability debrief or assessment of the systems performance at the conclusion of the demonstration. The demonstration is a continuation of market research and will be used for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Participation in the demonstration and any results gathered there from will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor participation in the demonstration. The contractor grants the government unrestricted rights to use any data gathered during the demonstration for use in assessing the feasibility of proceeding with a BETSS-C EADC acquisition strategy. This announcement concerning an EADC product demonstration does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The contractor is solely responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information provided to the government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information, product demonstration or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this market survey.  <BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, 07806- 5000, on behalf of PM Close Combat Systems Networked Munitions, requests that interested sources provide information on potential material solutions that fill area denial mission capabilities without the use of anti-personnel mines.  Anti-personnel mine, as used in this market survey, means a mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure, or kill one or more persons.  Mines designated to be equipped with anti-handling devices are not considered anti-personnel mines as a result of being so equipped.  Anti-handling device, as used in this market survey, means a device intended to protect a mine and which is part of, linked to, attached to, or placed under the mine and which activates when an attempt is made to tamper with or otherwise intentionally disturb the mine. Potential solutions can incorporate Anti-handling devices necessary to protect anti-tank/vehicle mines. This Market Survey is NOT seeking information on capabilities that replace the persistent mines (M14, M16, M15, M19 and M21 antipersonnel and anti-tank mines) as programs (Spider Anti-Personnel Alternative and the Scorpion Anti-Vehicle Alternative networked munitions systems) are already in place to address replacement of the persistent mines.  This purpose of this Market Survey is to gather information on potential material solutions that have the performance capability to fully replace the current Family of Scatterable Mines (FASCAM) capabilities (the M86 Pursuit Defense Munitions (PDM), the M131 MOPMS, M87/M87A1 Volcano (Ground and Air), M692 and M731 ADAM 155MM, M718/A1, M741/A1 RAAM 155MM, and the CBU-89A/B and CBU-78A/B Gator bombs) without being designated an Anti-personnel mine, as defined above.  

Interested parties shall provide information about their capabilities to meet the Technical and Functional requirements delineated below.  Respondents should possess, have the capacity to possess, or in the near future anticipate possessing, the capability to meet all of the Technical requirements and some or all of the Functional requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) seeks to obtain market research information from all commercial sources regarding novel solutions for fixed and removable lightweight armor protective systems.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced armor and armor materials to ballistic impact from two projectiles (BZ AP projectile and 0.50 caliber FSP) impacting at 100 feet per second above stated V0 limit velocities.
This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received. Proprietary data or business sensitive information, as any information received, may be used by the Government but will not be released to the public or diverged to other outside sources. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.  If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research.


1.0	LIGHTWEIGHT ARMOR CONCEPTS
The following are design and manufacturing parameters that will be considered during assessments: a)	An armor concept, with a total thru-thickness no greater than three (3.0) inches b)	An armor concept with a total areal density less than ten (10) pounds per square foot. (This is the total acceptable areal density when the design concept is applied such that the projectiles are defeated when impacting normal to the armor panel. If the concept requires impact at a stated obliquity for defeat, then the areal density shall be calculated based on the line-of-sight thickness thru the panel concept at that obliquity).  c)	Any supporting data (ballistic and otherwise) which indicates the concept has the potential to meet the projectile limit velocity requirements. d)	Ease of application as a removable armor concept, i.e. one which can be attached to and removed from a flat steel surface.e)	Maintainability
For each solution that meets the performance requirements, down selection will be performed based on the following:a)	Weightb)	Costc)	Ease of Applicationd)	Maintainabilitye)	Availabilityf)	Additional V-50/V-0 Performance
2.0 PLAN OF ACTION & MILESTONES
NSWCDD will conduct the Lightweight Armor Concepts evaluation in accordance with the following Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M):
2.1	RESPONSE SUBMITTAL
Information in response to this inquiry will be accepted from the date of the synopsis through 21 May 2010.  Responses shall address the parameters identified in Paragraph 1.0.  It is acknowledged that substantive data for emerging technologies for thorough evaluation of every parameter may not be available; however, all relevant information from responders shall provide a list of materials associated with their armor and corresponding Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  Responses are limited to ten (10) pages, not including the material list and MSDS.
2.2	ASSESSMENT
NSWCDD will assess the information received in response to this inquiry based on the criteria outlined in Paragraphs 2.1 during the period 21 May 2010 through 31 May 2010.  Upon completion of this assessment, NSWCDD will select companies to participate in the Lightweight Armor Concept performance testing.
2.3	TEST SAMPLE DELIVERY 
For those coupons selected for performance testing, the Government will request delivery of 4 samples to be delivered by 15 June 2010, at no cost to the government. The Sample Armor Coupons shall meet the sizes, configurations, and quantities as described below (see Paragraph 2.4).  Upon successful screening test completion of these coupons, companies will be requested to supply 13 additional coupons for a formal V50 screening and one additional V0 screening. This will be at the company's option. All data generated through this test series will be deemed as "for government distribution only, not releasable to vendors/contractors". Note, however, that each company will receive all test data for panels which it supplies. The additional 13 coupons will need to be delivered to NSWCDD by 15 July 2010.  
2.4	PERFORMANCE TESTING
Material submitted will be required to be under an areal density of 10 lbs/ft2 and have the ability to defeat the two threats (BZ and 0.50 caliber FSP) at stated V0 requirements. Selected Vendors shall be requested to submit four armor coupon samples of candidate systems for test at no cost to the government. These panels shall have areal dimensions of eight inches by eight inches (8" x 8") with four (4) 9/16-inch holes placed within an internal six inch by six inch (6" x 6") square. (Please reference Fig 1 below). If RFI panels pass initial screening, vendors will be asked to supply 13 additional panels for a formal V50 screening and one additional V0 screening. Vendor information shall be treated as proprietary.  Vendors shall receive all test data generated on their sample coupons. The data generated through this test series will be deemed as "for government distribution only, not releasable to vendors/contractors". Note, however, that each company will receive all test data for panels which it supplies.
The screening coupons provided will be subjected to performance testing during the period 21 June, 2010 to 1 July 2010.  This performance testing will include two (2) shots for each stated projectile according to the following:

<SUBJECT>Operation of a proposed to be built mini grille
<SOLNBR>2110200CAC026 
<RESPDATE>050710
<CONTACT>Marvin Grubbs, Phone 571-227-4978, Fax 571-227-3219, Email marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a potential requirement for construction of a mini grille type operation; however, before any construction is to begin, the feasibility of a firm actually bidding on the operation of the grille needs to be determined. As such this Sources Sought is issued to request some market research and feasibility on the contents herein. TSA cannot discuss this requirement nor allow a site visit at this time. TSA wishes to determine if a firm would/could operate such a facility if built without exorbitant expense and overpriced items to make up for any loss. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Your firm is invited to respond in writing only to this sources sought notification no later than Friday, May 7, 2010 at 1200 p.m. local DC time providing its interest and analysis in said operation. Responses shall be submitted to <a href="mailto:Marvin.Grubbs@dhs.gov">Marvin.Grubbs@dhs.gov</a>.&nbsp;Responses are limited to 2 pages only.<br /></em></span></strong><br />TSA has a secure single story facility in the Dulles / Herndon, Virginia area. At the current time there are no food or beverage services available, other than vending machines. Currently personnel must leave the facility and travel approximately 1 to 2 miles to secure food and beverages. The facility houses several departments comprised of approximately 317 personnel. The scope of this mini grille will not allow outside personnel catering due to the secure nature of the facility. Patronage from other sources is not permitted by TSA, since the services to be provided are for the benefit and convenience of Federal employees, contractors, visitors and registered guests.</p>
<p>There are currently two common dining areas with vending machines and tables and chairs for dining. One of the dining areas will be converted into a cafeteria with no seating.</p>
<p>Food and Beverage Vendors within a mile from the facility at the McLearan Square:<br />1. Burger King<br />2. Popeye's Chicken<br />3. Little Italy<br />4. Chinese Food Buffet<br />5. Quiznos Subs<br />6. Bloom Grocery store<br />7. Japanese Restaurant<br />8. Vocelli Pizza<br />9. Kabob Place<br />10. Touchdown Deli - a mile away not at the McLearan Square</p>
<p>Facility Background</p>
<p>The facility was established in response to the direction provided by the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, as part of the President's Management Strategy and enables the Administrator of TSA to fulfill the responsibilities established in PL 107-71, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA). The facility serves as the 24/7/365 coordination center for transportation security-related operations, incidents, or crises for TSA within the Department of Homeland Security. The facility will correlate and fuse real-time intelligence and operational information, ensuring unity of command and action in the prevention of, and response to, terrorist-related incidents across all transportation modes (maritime, land, and aviation). The facility provides the TSA executive team which will determine the appropriate course of action related to the transportation security threats, with real time information across agencies and across the United States. The decisions made will provide the U.S. public with increased speed and capabilities to respond to nationwide transportation terrorist threats.</p>
<p>Estimated customer count at the facility*:</p>
<p>Approx. percentage is based on existing TSA HQ customer count<br />Breakfast coffee = 35% of 317 = 111 customers<br />Full Breakfast = 23% of 317 = 73 customers.<br />Lunch = 52% of 317 = 165 customers</p>
<p>* The above 317 personnel count not does include the following and does not guarantee occupancy at any given time:<br />1. (50) personnel for the new build-out space<br />2. The 3 existing multipurpose rooms - capacity load up to (150)<br />3. The 3 new multipurpose rooms - capacity load up to ( 210)<br />4. Surge or COOP efforts<br />5. ECR and other meeting rooms throughout the Facility</p>
<p>Proposed Cafeteria Hours: <br />7 days per week, except Federal Holidays<br />Breakfast served from 6:00 am to 10:00 am <br />Morning Break from 10:00 am to 11:30 am<br />Lunch from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm<br />Afternoon Limited Service from 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm</p>
<p>Design Layout: attached</p>
<p>It is noted that the General Services Concessions Management Guide (PMFC#-93) has established criteria for the service level in leased buildings under its control. According to the Standard Level of Concessions Services Level for a building with 400 occupants, a facility described as a pre packaged snack bar is appropriate for a building the size of this one. Prepackaged snack bars include vending machines services and may include self serve selections offering full line on site beverage, prepackaged food, and sundries.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to sole source award a firm fixed price services contract for Project Management Support Services for Railroad Coordination Various Projects for the Hurricane Protection Office, Vicinity of New Orleans, LA to Norfolk Southern Corporation.  THESE PROPRIETARY COORDINATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE REQUIRED WITH THE OWNER (NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION) OF THE PROPERTY.<BR><BR>The railroad will participate in pre-construction meetings with the Corps (USACE) and the construction contractors.  They will also provide on-site services to assure that the contractors operations do not interfere with the railroads operations.  Some aspects of the work are specialized such as driving battered piling adjacent to and extending over the railroad tracks.<BR><BR>The line of protection for the hurricane protection system for the New Orleans East and New Orleans Metro polders crosses the Railroads tracks in two (2) locations and runs parallel to the tracks for over six (6) miles.  The gaps in the line of protection are closed by the means of steel flood gates.  The gate structures are on Railroad property by permit and the levee runs parallel to and adjacent to the Railroads property.  A floodwall is being built on top of the levee through most of this reach.  The Railroad expertise is needed because the project impacts their property.<BR><BR>Not having a contract in place with the Railroad could cause substantial indefinite delay of the construction of the hurricane protection in these reaches.  This would result in a gap in the line of protection thus negating substantial worth of public investment and endangering human life and property.<BR><BR>Government shall evaluate offer on Price Alone.  <BR><BR>Offerors must submit a quotation with a statement of capabilities and support documentation showing that the Offeror is the proprietary owner and as a result is eligible to be the provider of these services, by April 27, 2010, 4:00 p.m. CT.

<DESC>PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this special notice is to provide interested parties with some additional broad information regarding the scope and USG expectations in this effort. It is anticipated that the prospective bidders will use this information to generate questions and to fully understand the Governments requirements. The document is not intended to be a Request for Information (RFI) but is simply provided for the offerors to use as a tool to facilitate their bid and proposal process. <br />BACKGROUND<br />The FMU 152A/B Bomb Fuze and Accessories (USAF) is compliant with each of the requirements of the System Specification and is currently in full-rate production of 12,000 systems a year with a demonstrated surge capability in excess of 20,000 systems a year. In the near term, production implementation of an FMU 152B/B Bomb Fuze with a FZU 63/B Bomb Fuze Initiator is expected and will be the fully-compliant baseline for the follow-on production contract. From a design and manufacturing standpoint, the changes are minor and nomenclature changes were required only because a low airspeed capability was added and the GBU 15/AGM 130 mission capability was removed. The changes will be briefed in detail at the planned Industry Day and a draft System Specification will be provided. The Technical Data Package for this design will be made available "for information only".<br />SCOPE<br />The goal of this follow-on effort is to acquire systems that are fully compliant. This is a production effort and thus development is neither in the funding nor the schedule. Therefore, the following are some example scenarios envisioned:<br />Current design (fully qualified design and facilities)<br />Current design (requiring facility qualification/FAAT)<br />Alternate design (fully qualified design and facilities)<br />Alternate design (minor qualification/FAAT)<br />If alternate designs are considered, offerors must be aware that the available funding is for production with extremely limited funding for design qualification, or verifications and validations beyond the First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT). Although this effort does not preclude minor changes to meet the Performance Specification, clearly one must enter this effort with a previously- qualified, production- ready product.<br />

Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 3, Division of Construction and Acquisition at Ft. Snelling, Minnesota, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with eENZYME, LLC, of Montgomery Village, Maryland, a prefabricated micro-lab with three clean rooms. This micro-lab is necessary to increase the La Crosse Fish Health Center's capacity to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on a weekly basis. The PCR is an assay tool fish health biologists are using to monitor the geographical distribution of Epizootic Epitheliotropic Disease virus (EEDV) in strains of wild lake trout in the Great Lakes. The PCR, EEDV surveillance study is a cooperative effort between the Service's Region 3 and 5 fish health laboratories, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the University of California - Davis Department of Microbiology. With the purchase of this micro-lab the study will also have the capacity to monitor non-lake trout species of fish in the Great Lakes which coexist with native lake trout to see if they are a reservoir of infection for the virus. There are many micro-lab designs available on the market, but none like the one from eENZYME which consists of three separate work areas, each with its own segregated air supply and buffered entry area.  More importantly, this prefabricated unit will fit within the space provided at the fish health lab. As more DNA analysis is used to detect fish pathogens in hatchery and free-ranging fish species PCR assay work will continue to grow and the need for a micro-lab like the one from eENZYME will become more critical.

It is an international computer-based message-switching system that links together state, local, and federal law enforcement and justice agencies for the purpose of information exchange.  It also provides information services support for a growing need for justice-related applications.  NLETS supports data communications links to state networks using a commercial frame relay service.  All federal agencies with a justice component use this interface, and the Department of the Interior needs to maintain compatibility for communication.  NLETS owns the data rights to this system and is the only provider of this service. The period of performance for this effort is one base year and three option years.
Interested parties may identify their interest and submit capabilities to Alexis_N_Williams@nbc.gov by 2:00 PM eastern time on April 28, 2010.  Questions and responses submitted by a method other than electronic mail shall not be accepted and shall not be answered.  
This is NOT a solicitation. No award will be made on the basis of quotations or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>Program Overview:<br />Purpose of this synopsis is to publicize that the 558th Aircraft Sustainment Group, Hill AFB, UT intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract for KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS) short-term or interim support prepared in accordance with FAR 5.201. The sole source determination is made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. This interim support will be performed as a contingency and limited to what is needed to prevent interruptions in aircrew training as the existing KC-135 ATS contract (F33657-91-C-0072) expires on 30 Sep 2010, and if delays in completing source selection for a new replacement support contract (see Notice under FA8223-10-R-50094) are encountered. This interim contract would only be issued and these Options exercised only as the on-going process of awarding the contract under the re-competition effort for comprehensive ATS support dictates. In accordance with these limitations, no major upgrades or concurrency modifications will be performed on the interim contract. Flight Safety Services Corporation, 10770 E Briarwood Ave Suite 100, Centennial CO 80112-3807, is identified in the sole source justification as the only source with the specialized skills required to perform this interim effort and is the incumbent on the current contract. The sole source justification will be publicized 14 days after the award of the sole source contract. The Request for Proposal (RFP FA8223-10-R-50168), with accompanying Performance Work Statement (PWS) and terms and conditions will be posted under this combined Synopsis and Solicitation notice at least 15 days after the date of this synopsis, with proposal due 30 days after the RFP is posted. Market research was previously conducted, including a Request for Information (RFI) notice posted to Fed Biz Ops (FBO) on 15 Dec 2009 under FA8223-10-R-135ATSinterim, which is now archived at FBO. <br />Foreign participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level.<br />The anticipated period of performance for this short-term support contract will be for up to 1 year comprised of a 3-month base contract and three 3-month options, from 01 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 (FY 2011) if all options are exercised. This contract would only be issued and these Options would only be exercised as the on-going process of awarding the contract under the re-competition effort for comprehensive ATS support dictates (see separate notice FA8223-10-R-50094). The anticipated award for this re-competed effort is in August 2010.
<p>The KC-135 Simulator System is comprised of 19 KC-135 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), 2 Boom Operator Part Task Trainers (BOPTTs), 27 GATM IHC Part Task Trainers (GIPTT), 6 Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) in various configurations, over 400 Computer Based Training (CBT) Workstations and laptops, 25 AFMSS desktop trainers, 30 Instructor trainer laptops, 1 Cargo Loading Trainer, and Instructional Material (IM) (note: IM consists of courseware, photographs, and other associated items used in training sessions). Devices and IM are utilized at the main training facility, Altus AFB, and at twelve (12) other bases in the CONUS and OCONUS area. Two are OCONUS, Kadena and Mildenhall.<br />The KC-135 ATS is a broadly scoped, active and dynamic performance based services program providing initial qualification and re-qualification KC-135 training to Pilots, Boom Operators and Instructors. A very active operations tempo (large numbers of students) and impetus to move more training from the aircraft to the ATS/simulator under AFSO 21 initiatives also contributes challenges faced by this program. <br />The contractor will: <br />&bull; Conduct initial, continuation, and requalification training for KC-135 aircrews including pilots, navigators, and boom operators. <br />&bull; Maintain the training devices and IM to the baseline that will be in place at 30 Sep 2010. No major upgrades or concurrency modifications will be accomplished during this short term interim period. These are reserved for and as described in the re-competition effort under FA8223-10-R-50094. <br />&bull; Provide facility management. <br />&bull; Provide Program Management including Systems Engineering, Quality Assurance, Data/Configuration Management, and ESOH management. <br />&bull; Provide guaranteed student throughput with on-time graduation and remediation as required, meeting projected student throughput requirements and Air Force standards, while students pass an Air Force administered evaluation. This includes provisions for variations in quantity of students (range of throughput) and content of training. <br />&bull; Adequately staff the ATS with qualified personnel and retain key personnel in all aspects of the ATS. Effective management of the overall ATS, including ongoing efforts, problem identification and resolution, special projects, reporting and communication, startup transition, security and safety. A seamless transition between the current contract and the new contract is required. <br />&bull; Effectively manage and operate the Training System Support Centers (TSSC) at Altus AFB to include appropriate manning levels to effectively complete approved TSSC taskings within the required timeframe.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within fifteen (15) days of this publication. A determination by the government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />Ms. Sharon Porter, OO-ALC/PKC, Hill AFB UT 84056, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>NOTE – This synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on February 18, 2010 under Solicitation Number SS=PCPSB-05019-61.
 
The Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, NCI approved the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial in January 1991. Contracts were awarded in September 1992. Ten Screening Centers (SCs), a Coordinating Center (CC), and a Laboratory (Lab) were competitively selected. In July 2009, the NCI approved the continuation of centralized follow-up of PLCO participants beyond the originally planned 13-year follow-up period.  Currently the 10 Screening Centers are conducting the follow-up activities and the intent is to administer follow-up through a single contractor.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Divisions of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) and Cancer Prevention (DCP) is proposing to contract for services to support centralized follow-up of Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial participants who have agreed to continued PLCO participation to obtain cancer diagnosis-, death- and risk factor-related data on these participants to determine if screening for the named cancers reduces deaths from these cancers. Approximately 155,000 men and women were enrolled in PLCO between 1993 and 2001. An anticipated 80,000 to 90,000 participants will be included in centralized follow-up.

The NAICS code for the project is 541990.

The small business size standard is $7M.

The proposed acquisition will involve the following type of activities: 1) Establish a Central Data Collection Center (CDCC) for the continued, centralized follow up of PLCO participants for approximately five years,  2)  Develop a mechanism to transfer data from the central data collection server to the existing PLCO Coordinating Center,  3)  Prepare IRB Submissions as required, 4)  Conduct Annual Study Update Administration to determine participants’ current health and identify newly diagnosed cancers, 5) Conduct Risk Factor Questionnaire Administration to enhance key exposure data, 6) Conduct Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ) Administration to assess current screening behavior in the cohort, 7) Conduct Retention Activities to keep participants engaged in the study, 8) Conduct Tracing Procedures for participants lost to follow up, 9) Conduct Medical Record Collection and Abstraction for identified cancers,10) Conduct Pathology Tissue Collection from identified cancers,  11) Collect Death Certificates from next of kin of deceased participants or from state agencies to ascertain the cause of death, 12) Provide coordination with the PLCO Sites to establish scientific and administrative liaisons with personnel from the ten original PLCO Screening Centers to facilitate clinical data collection, if needed, 13) Identify Sites that will need to submit to State Tumor Registries,  14) Establish a toll-free Call Number for PLCO Participants and 15) Establish a PLCO Website for PLCO Participants.

A pre-proposal conference related to this solicitation will be held via NIH videocast on May 26, 2010 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM.  Additional information regarding this pre-proposal conference may be found in the solicitation under Section L.1(d).  Prospective offerors are expected to review the solicitation in detail and be prepared to submit questions in advance of the conference to allow the most efficient use of the allotted time.

The NCI intends to award one cost-reimbursement contract with a period of performance of five years.  The Government intends to have a full & open competition for this requirement in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This synopsis is not an RFP; an RFP is anticipated for release on or about May 10, 2010 through Federal Business Opportunities (http://fbo.gov).

The major potable water and wastewater systems (specifically the control and automation system) currently in place at the Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) requires replacement components.  
The manufacturer, Automation Direct, was the original designer, manufacturer, and installer of the control and automation system.  In order to meet the government's requirement and maintain the integrity of the system, the replacements parts from Automation Direct are the only parts, with no known similar parts, that can meet the particular features of the system. e. Other brand name components used in this unique system are manufactured by Stride, Dayton, Eaton, Solo and Pro Sense.  These components, although made by other manufacturers, must be replaced in kind so that the whole system works as designed.  
Based on the proprietary nature of a large portion of the systems' components there are no other manufacturers that can fulfill the requirements of those components. Based on the above information, we recommend the brand name parts from Automation Direct and their components as the only company that can provide the needed components for repair and replacement of the control system parts.
The requiring activity certifies that the information provided to support this recommendation is complete and accurate to the best of our knowledge.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK Online Radiology Courses for VHA Radiologic TechnologistsLittle Rock Employee Education System10.LR.ONLINERADCOURSE.A1. SCOPEa.	BackgroundThe Department of Veterans Affairs has approximately 2500 radiologic technologist and radiologic technologist (therapeutic) staff. The American Registry of Radiologic Technology (ARRT) requires that to maintain certification, all RTR and RTT must achieve 24 hours of continuous education (CE). This education can be category A or B. The distinction between Category A and Category B activities is not based on the nature of the activity itself, but rather is based upon whether the activity has been reviewed and approved by a Recognized Continuing Education Evaluation Mechanism (RCEEM). A RCEEM is a quality control mechanism for CE activities. One option for satisfying the CE requirements is to earn 24 credits of continuing education during the biennium. A minimum of 12 credits must be from Category A activities. The other 12 credits may be from Category A or Category B activities. A maximum of 12 Category B credits may be claimed in a biennium. A maximum of 12 CE credits per biennium may be claimed for tumor boards. Directed readings, home study courses, or Internet activities reported in a biennium may not be repeated for credit in the same or any subsequent biennium. The CE requirements are linked to a two-year cycle (biennium) that is defined in relation to a registrant's birth month. The biennium begins on the first day of the registrant's birth month. The biennium extends for two years on the last day of the month that precedes the registrant's birth month. Each registrant's biennium dates are identified in the lower left corner of the annual Application for Renewal of Registration and are printed on the carrier they receive with their pocket credential card after renewal of registration is complete. Biennium dates may also be verified by accessing the RT Directory on the ARRT Web Page (www.arrt.org) or through the automated phone system by selecting option 5, CE Information. All CE credits must be completed between these dates. The renewal of registration will continue on an annual basis, with the CE requirements being reported every other year. The two-year CE cycle was selected to allow flexibility in fulfilling the requirements (i.e., if no CE can be earned in the first year, the second year is still available to complete the credits). The completion of one biennium will mark the beginning of the next biennium. Credits earned in one biennium cannot be carried forward into the next biennium.    The continuing education requirement is not dependent on the number of ARRT certificates held by an individual. For example, a technologist certified in both radiography and mammography need earn only 24 credits per biennium for the ARRT. For ARRT, the credits do not have to be specific to radiography or mammography but must be relevant to the radiologic sciences and/or patient care. All technologists should select CE topics that are related to their area of practice and that will address the needs of the patient and the Registered Technologist.  NOTE: This does not address the CE requirement for the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All activities applied toward the CE requirements must meet the ARRT's definition of a continuing education activity. The definition states that a learning activity must be planned, organized and administered to enhance the knowledge and skills underlying the professional performance that a technologist uses to provide services to patients, the public or the medical profession. Activities meeting this definition may qualify as either Category A or Category B credit, depending upon whether they have been approved by a RCEEM. The RCEEM acts as a quality control mechanism for the CE activities. The individual participating in the CE activity does not submit the activity to a RCEEM for approval. Instead, the individual is responsible for selecting activities that the sponsor has already submitted to a RCEEM for Category A credit.   There are a number of activities that do not require submission to a RCEEM to qualify for Category A credit. They include: (1) Activities meeting ARRT's definition of an Approved Academic Course; (2) CPR certification through the Heart Association, Red Cross or American Safety and Health Institute; and (3) Activities relevant to the radiologic sciences and/or patient care that have been approved by the American Medical Association (AMA Category 1) or the American Nurses Association (ANA) through the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). All other CE activities must be approved by a RCEEM in order to be assigned Category A credits. The ARRT recognizes that some states have legislation requiring CE credits to maintain a state license to practice in the profession. An ARRT registrant who completes CE activities in the state in which he or she is licensed as part of his or her state's licensing requirements may count the CE credit as Category A if the state regulatory agency is mandated by law to evaluate CE activities for licensing purposes and has approved the activity for CE credit. The state licensing agencies currently approved as meeting ARRT criteria are Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon and Texas. Activities that an individual intends to use for Category B credit must satisfy the ARRT's definition as a continuing education activity even though they have not been submitted to a RCEEM for approval. The activity must be a legitimate continuing education activity regardless of whether it is or is not reviewed by a RCEEM. Category A activities are awarded the number of CE credits assigned by the evaluation mechanism (i.e., RCEEM, state licensing agency).  Activities not submitted to a RCEEM for approval, but which meet the ARRT's definition of a CE activity, will be awarded one CE credit for each contact hour. A contact hour is defined as being equal to 50 to 60 minutes. Activities longer than one hour should be assigned whole or partial CE credit based on the 50-minute hour. Educational activities of 30 to 49 minutes in duration will be awarded one-half CE credit. An activity that lasts less than 30 minutes will receive no credit. The technologist is responsible for keeping the original documents for one full year after the end of the reporting cycle.       b.	Objectives1.

These requirements are located here: NIST Std 800-37 Guide for the Security Accreditation and Certification of Federal Systems.            http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37/SP800-37-final.pdf NIST Std 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Systems.            http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53/SP800-53.pdf FIPS Pub 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems.            http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf FIPS Pub 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.            http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips199/FIPS-PUB-199-final.pdfNOTE: According to guidance received from VHA Security folks, if the database stores the SSN, the system is automatically categorized as Moderate. VHA Dir 2004-002 Use of Commercial or External Web Hosting Services for VHA Websites, states:"Effective management controls have been established and maintained Administration-wide for the creation and use of externally-hosted data to protect the integrity and security of sensitive data (such as patient data, employee data, and identifiable-quality assurance data); therefore, it is VHA policy that contractors who host sensitive data for any VHA entity must establish Business Associate Agreements, as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, for the protection of individually-identifiable health information used or disclosed by business associates."       http://vaww1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=298NOTE: In this Directive, they mention VA Dir 6214 as the guidance for Cyber-Security. VA Dir 6214 was replaced with the NIST Standards mentioned above.If the courses are hosted on the awarded contractor(s)' servers, the employee training history data must be transmitted to either the VA LMS or the VCampus Enterprise Knowledge Platform (EKP). The required data fields are listed above in the section Technical Requirements, Data Transmission. Reporting employee training data must be provided to the VA or VCampus EKP daily.An alternative to the contractor delivering the courses from their servers is to provide the courses to the VA so they will be hosted by a VA designated system. If this is done all employee data tracking and reporting will be handled by the VA designated system and the contractor's servers need not be certified and accredited as long as the contractor does not retain any personally identifiable demographic data about people who are authorized by the VA to take courses provided under this contract.VA Information and Information System Security/Privacy Requirements for IT Contracts, August 2008Please review weblink http://www.iprm.oit.va.gov/ and within this link select:http://www.iprm.oit.va.gov/docs/Security_and_Privacy_Requirements_for_IT_Contracts_Attachment.pdf to review VA Information and Information System Security/Privacy Requirements for IT Contracts, August 2008. Some of the requirements include:VA Information Custodial RequirementsInformation made available to the contractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the contracting officer. This clause expressly limits the contractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d)(1).Information generated by a Contractor as a part of the contractor's normal business operations, such as medical records created in the course of providing treatment, is subject to a review by the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to determine if the information is the property of VA and subject to VA policy. If the information is determined by OGC to not be the property of VA, the restrictions required for VA information will not apply.VA information will not be co-mingled with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems/media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. VA also reserves the right to conduct IT resource inspections to ensure data separation and on-site inspection of information destruction/media sanitization procedures to ensure they are in compliance with VA policy requirements.Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor will not destroy information received from VA or gathered or created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA contracting officer. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, and applicable VA Records Control Schedules.The contractor will receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. Applicable Federal information security regulations include all Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publications (SP) issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies, including FIPS or SP, in this contract.Contractors collecting, storing, or disseminating personal identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) data must conform to all pertinent regulations, laws, and VA directives related to privacy. Contractors must provide access for VA privacy reviews and assessments and provide appropriate documentation as directed.The contractor shall not make copies of VA information except as necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor needs to be restored to an operating state.If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") part 12.If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated business associate agreement (BAA) will also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01 Business Associates.Contractor will store, transport or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using a VA-approved encryption application that meets the requirements of NIST's FIPS 140-2 standard.The contractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA directives are available on the VA directives Web site at http://wwwl Nagovivapubsf.Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor will refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor shall not release medical quality assurance records protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 or records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus protected under 38 U.S.C. 7332 under any circumstances, including in response to a court order, and shall immediately refer such court orders or other inquiries to the VA contracting officer for response.The contractor will not use technologies banned in VA in meeting the requirements of the contract (e.g., Bluetooth enabled devices).Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.

The contractor security control procedures must be identical, not equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A privacy impact assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of personally identifiable information, as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls need to be stated within the PIA and supported by a risk assessment. If these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.Outsourcing (contractor facility/contractor equipment/contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-37 and VA Handbook 6500 and a privacy impact assessment of the contractor's systems prior to operation of the systems. Government-owned (government facility/government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require a system interconnection agreement and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which detail what data types will be shared, who will have access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.The contractor must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the information security officer (ISO) for entry into VA's Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) management process. The contractor will use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the Government. Contractor procedures will be subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials. The physical security aspects associated with contractor activities will also be subject to such assessments. As updates to the system occur, an updated PIA must be submitted to the VA Privacy Service through the COTR for approval.All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA sensitive information must have all VA sensitive information removed, cleared, sanitized, or destroyed in accordance with VA policies and procedures upon: (1) completion or termination of the contract or (2) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor, whichever is earlier.All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA sensitive information must have all VA sensitive information removed, cleared, sanitized, or destroyed in accordance with VA policies and procedures upon: (1) completion or termination of the contract or (2) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor, whichever is earlier.8. REHABILITATION ACT, SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE       Courseware and the site must be compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as validated by the VHA Section 508 Office. All federal agencies, when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, are required to give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.         A good Section 508 website can be found at http://www.section508.gov. Since Section 508 requirements can be vague, we suggest adhering to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which is a World Wide Web Consortium Standard. We suggest that all content vendors adhere to Conformance Level "A" requirements. Pertinent sections for compliance are sections 21, 22, 24, and 31. Information on this standard can be found at http://www.w3c.org/wai, specifically, in the document "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0".         Also, a checklist has been added as an appendix to ensure compliance.  Vendors are encouraged to complete the checklist to determine if online courses meet the section 508 standards.9.  VA DIRECTIVE 6102 COMPLIANCE       This directive establishes policy for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees in managing, maintaining, establishing, and presenting information on VA's Internet/Intranet Service Sites and use of related Internet services.       The VA 6102 Handbook implements the policies contained in VA Directive 6102, Internet/Intranet Services. This includes but is not limited to File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Web pages, Active Server Pages (ASP), e-mail forums, and list servers.

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background & Objectives

The overall purpose of this procurement, extending over the (3) years of the contract period (three base years with two one year options), is to support AHRQ’s Prevention/Care Management Portfolio in its work to build evidence and facilitate improvements in primary care, clinical preventive services, and care of chronic conditions related to:  1) clinical decision making; and 2) the application of primary care transformation principles, including care coordination, patient activation/self management support, the integration of health information technology in support of the goals of the Portfolio, and linkages between clinical practices and community-based/public health interventions for prevention and care of chronic conditions.  

Under  this Multiple Award IDIQ contract, the contractor(s) will establish a Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM TAC).  It is anticipated that the PCM TAC will help build the Nation’s capacity for effective work in the prevention of disease and the provision of care for chronic conditions, with a special emphasis on improving primary care and building successful collaborations across the clinical services, public health, and community sectors. The PCM TAC will use multiple methods (including direct technical assistance, knowledge transfer, health communications strategy development, and dissemination of tools, resources, and research results) to maximize the benefit to health care systems, primary care practices, primary care clinicians and patients of investments made by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in prevention and care management research, dissemination, and implementation initiatives.


Statement of Work

The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  In 2008, the Agency restructured its work within six portfolios including: Comparative Effectiveness; Health Information Technology; Innovation and Emerging Issues; Patient Safety; Prevention/Care Management; and Value.  

The mission of the Prevention/Care Management Portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings.  The Prevention/Care Management Portfolio works to accomplish its mission through two strategic goals.  The strategic goals are based on the Expanded Care Model , a new model that includes population health promotion and enhanced community participation in the work of health system teams to improve clinical outcomes.  The Portfolio’s two strategic goals are:   

1.	Supporting clinical decision-making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, the synthesis of evidence, and the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations; and, 

2.	Supporting the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through 
&#61607;	health care redesign; 
&#61607;	clinical-community linkages; 
&#61607;	self management support; 
&#61607;	integration of health information technology; and 
&#61607;	care coordination.  

These goals are accomplished through work in the areas of knowledge generation, knowledge synthesis and dissemination, and implementation and use of knowledge.  

Knowledge Generation

The Prevention/Care Management Portfolio funds grants to generate new knowledge about prevention and care management in areas including the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions and the transformation of primary care.  The Portfolio has funded exploratory grants in this area to help guide the appropriate prioritization, timing, and provision of therapeutic and preventive services in individuals with multiple chronic conditions. This work will improve the ability of clinicians, patients and policy makers to identify those interventions that provide the greatest benefit to patients with multiple conditions and help patients make informed decisions about health care choices.  Funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) through the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services also supplement current efforts in this area.  

In addition, the Portfolio and AHRQ have identified the need for research that will identify, describe and disseminate the best methods for transforming the structure, characteristics and function of primary care so that practices can improve quality, reduce costs, and better satisfy the needs of patients and families. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) has been proposed by a broad coalition of providers, employers, insurers and others as a model for improving primary care in the U.S., and numerous health care systems and medical groups are currently attempting to transform their primary care practices into PCMHs.  These attempts go beyond incremental quality improvement activities and aim toward whole practice redesign.  

AHRQ supports systematic studies of on-going, successful efforts to transform the delivery of primary care in the U.S.  This research will validate that healthcare quality, as reflected in quantifiable changes in process and outcome measures, has in fact improved subsequent to practice transformation into a PCMH, and will study in detail how the transformation occurred and its impact on costs of care and actual patient and provider experiences/satisfaction.  In addition, investigators will study the organizational and contextual factors within practices that have influenced the success of these efforts.  

Knowledge Synthesis & Dissemination 

The Portfolio fulfills AHRQ’s congressionally mandated role to convene the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to conduct scientific evidence reviews of a broad array of clinical preventive services (screening, counseling and preventive medication) and to develop recommendations for the health care community.  The Portfolio provides ongoing administrative, sceintific, technical, and dissemination support to the USPSTF, which is an independent panel of nationally renowned, non-federal experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine comprising primary care clinicians (e.g., internists, pediatricians, family physicians, gynecologists/obstetricians, nurses, and health behavior specialists) with strong science backgrounds. 

The USPSTF develops and releases evidence-based recommendations for the health care provider community to improve the delivery of appropriate preventive services in the clinical setting. The multi-year process of generating a recommendation begins with a solicitation of topic nominations through a Federal Register notice and consultation with stakeholders.  The USPSTF prioritizes nominated topics for review and for updating.  USPSTF recommendations are based on evidence reviews conducted by Evidence-based Practice Centers and in-house by AHRQ staff.

Portfolio staff have been working with the USPSTF to increase the transparency of its scientific and deliberative processes with the overarching goals of assuring integrity and fidelity of process and of aligning more closely with the processes developed by AHRQ for its Effective Healthcare Program.   AHRQ staff will continue and expand this work to include several opportunities for public comment on draft USPSTF products.  These efforts will be in coordination with final outcomes of current pending congressional legislation regarding the USPSTF.  

In 2009, the USPSTF released new recommendations for 12 clinical preventive services, and work was either initiated or continued on approximately 30 topics.  USPSTF recommendations provide one essential foundation for dissemination, implementation, and integration activities within the portfolio; however, the Portfolio supports the development of tools, materials and technical assistance to improve the delivery of evidence-based primary care.  For example, Portfolio staff created the electronic Preventive Services Selector tool (ePSS).  Available both as a Web-based tool and in PDA-downloadable form, the ePSS provides clinical decision support in user-friendly formats, allowing clinicians to search for USPSTF recommendations based on specific patient characteristics or to browse recommendations by topic. 

The Portfolio also supports work to create, enhance or evaluate health materials for use in primary care via electronic health records or other electronic tools.  Electronic health records (EHRs) have the capacity to deliver not only patient education materials, but also to be an educational tool for clinicians to use interactively with patients.  However, approximately one-third of American adults have limited health literacy. This means, for example, that they are unable to determine a proper dose of a medication based on an over-the-counter label. Limited health literacy can also affect comprehension of verbal communication. EHRs can include features that encourage clinicians to confirm patient understanding, such as a field that indicates patient’s comprehension level as well as anatomical drawing or interactive visuals that clinicians could use while educating patients about their condition. 

Implementation & Use of Knowledge

The Portfolio supports the development of tools, materials and technical assistance to facilitate health systems redesign in primary care settings. Focus areas include: health systems redesign, self management support; linking clinical practices with community resources; and, care coordination.    

Health Systems Redesign
In conjunction with the Agency’s Health Information Technology (Health IT) Portfolio, the P/CM Portfolio supports primary care transformation through exploration of the model of the patient-centered medical home. Examples of this work include developing a public website on the patient-centered medical home aimed at policy makers and health service researchers and the creation of a foundational white paper on integrating mental health and primary care within the PCMH.  

Self Management Support
Self-management support programs are expected to reduce costly health crises and improve health outcomes for chronically ill patients with conditions such as asthma, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, and migraine headaches.  A successful self-management support program has the potential to change individuals’ behavior, improve health outcomes, decrease the burden of chronically ill patients on the health care system, and be a cornerstone of primary care transformation. However, many practicing primary care clinicians have not had the opportunity to develop skills in self-management support or the opportunity to implement this aspect of the Expanded Care Model in their work.  The Portfolio is producing multimedia resources for primary care clinicians to help them learn about self-management support, develop their self-management support skills and provide patients with self management guidance. This project will support both prevention and care management related goals, bridging the two parts of the Portfolio.   

The Portfolio will continue work with federal partners to help understand and test what electronic health record elements can assist in improving the consistent delivery and documentation of self management support. Two challenges related to self management support are what elements can be integrated into the EHR to help prompt and document self management support (e.g., goal setting, action planning, follow-up), and what key measure(s) should be collected from the electronic record to drive performance improvement.  In addition, this work will explore the development and use of personal health records to support self management. 
 
Linking Clinical Practices with Community Resources
The Portfolio supports work to develop the evidence base for and implementation of linkages between clinical practices and community/public health resources to promote healthy behaviors and prevent disease.  This work will build on a summit in 2008 AHRQ co-sponsored with the American Medical Association and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, aimed at encouraging collaboration, coordination, and integration among health care providers, institutions, and community resources. Participants examined successful partnerships at health system, community, and State levels, and identified strategies to overcome partnership barriers. In order to facilitate ongoing collaboration among summit participants and to disseminate their work to a larger audience, a special resource page was added to AHRQ’s Web-based Innovations Exchange (http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov).  Innovation profiles and tools from the Innovations Exchange collection address promoting healthy behaviors and linkages among health care delivery, public health, and community-based interventions. 

In 2010, AHRQ will host a second, national Summit involving stakeholders from public health, community services, and primary care.  The Portfolio will make additional investments to advance knowledge in this area.

Care Coordination
In 2009, in response to stakeholder input, AHRQ began an 18-month foundational phase in a long-term process to develop quality measures for care coordination in ambulatory primary care settings.  The work began with development of a measurement framework and a detailed, systematic review of potential existing measures.  In 2010, the first phase of this work will be completed and AHRQ may initiate the second planned phase of this work—developing and validating specifications for a small set of measures.  AHRQ has a goal of launching a measure dissemination initiative in 2011 or 2012.

Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center
Under this IDIQ Multi award contract, the contractor(s) will establish a Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM TAC),  It is anticipated that the PCM TAC will help build the Nation’s capacity for effective work in the prevention of disease and the provision of care for chronic conditions, with a special emphasis on improving primary care and building successful collaborations across the clinical services, public health, and community sectors. The PCM TAC will use multiple methods (including direct technical assistance, knowledge transfer, health communications strategy development, and dissemination of tools, resources, and research results) to maximize the benefit to health care systems, primary care practices, primary care clinicians and patients of investments made by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in prevention and care management research, dissemination, and implementation initiatives.

A general description of each domain follows.  Offerors should be aware that many projects assigned under specific task orders will draw across two or all three domains.  Therefore, it is imperative that the offeror has adequate expertise and skill in each domain and that the offeror can assure coordination and cooperation across divisions/departments within its own organization as well as with Subcontractors.  Examples of several projects that span the three domains also are described below. 

1.	Administration
This domain encompasses many activities associated with developing an operations plan for the Prevention/Care Management Portfolio.  The operations plan for the Portfolio will build on internal strategic planning, and will include: gathering input from external stakeholders regarding the strategy and direction of the Portfolio, and synthesizing and disseminating the work of the Portfolio through a comprehensive inventory and subsequent Annual Reports.  Dissemination may include multiple products designed and written for different audiences.

The Contractor(s) may be asked to coordinate numerous complex tasks across multiple organizations including other contractors, Federal agencies, grantees and national organizations.  

2.	Research &  Project Development
This domain represents a broad range of activities that will support AHRQ in conducting research and developing programs.  Examples of potential projects include, but are not limited to: 
  
a.	Providing direct technical assistance to groups and individuals, including: assisting with the development, management, and dissemination of public use data; and facilitating interdisciplinary quality improvement work in primary care organizations and settings

b.	Conducting formal external evaluations of programs, tools, and materials

c.	Conducting health services research that may involve both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and that may require preparation of requests for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and approval from relevant Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

d.	Critically evaluating, synthesizing and organizing large volumes of information, which may include assessing and rating evidence from studies that vary widely in content and methodology

3.	Communications
This domain represents a broad range of activities and skills that focus on communicating the results of Portfolio work to multiple target audiences; engaging multiple stakeholders at various stages of the Portfolio’s work; and conducting educational opportunities for partners involved in Portfolio projects.  Potential audiences include primary care clinicians, policy makers, researchers and consumers/patients.  Examples of potential projects include, but are not limited to: 

a.	Providing specialized technical assistance in communications including: graphic elements and messaging; audience analysis and segmentation strategies; pre-testing of materials with multiple target audiences; and analysis of distribution (or communication) channels 

b.	Disseminating technical information to multiple audiences through multiple channels (print, electronic, etc.) 

c.	Developing and facilitating learning collaborations including: developing curricula; identifying faculty; developing teaching modules based on adult education techniques; assisting learner groups with strategic planning; and providing logistical support to each group such as creating and maintaining a shared Web portal, scheduling and conducting webinars, etc.  


Many task orders will describe a project that covers all 3 domains.  This is why it is essential that the Contractor(s) have extensive experience in each domain.  For example, the Contractor(s) may be asked to help the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force increase the transparency of its work.  This one project may include the following tasks: 

Administration: Creating the processes associated with posting draft USPSTF products and disposition tables.  Any new processes would have to take into account the roles of the USPSTF members, Evidence-based Practice Centers, official Partners to the USPSTF and AHRQ.  The Contractor(s) also could be asked to facilitate an open meeting of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
Research: Based on information gathered from other transparency efforts, advising AHRQ on options for the design of the database and web forms for collecting public comments, managing the collection of public comments, providing scientific review and synthesis of public comments. This may include making recommendations to AHRQ Medical Officers on how draft documents should be revised to address the major themes/issues observed in the public comments and assisting the Medical Officers in the creation of disposition tables that provide information about how the comments were handled and addressed, or actually creating the disposition tables.  

Communication: Providing technical assistance regarding the design elements of and messaging for a web form for collecting comments from multiple stakeholders; creating a marketing plan to advertise the opportunity for public comment to multiple stakeholders; and advising AHRQ staff on how to display disposition tables and/or revisions to draft documents.  

Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects.  It is expected that the Contractor(s) will have expertise within the project team that they propose in response to an RFTO, and will not require additional support or technical assistance in fulfilling any such requirements.  

The Contractor(s) will be required to designate a point person or small team to assume responsibility for: meeting contract requirements; coordinating tasks and activities; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff through the period of performance of the master contract.  Additionally, Contractors will need to propose specific project leads for individual task orders.  The overall master contract lead and individual task order leads may or may not be the same individuals.
The Contractor(s) shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQ’s Research Reporting System (ARRS).  In addition, the Contractor(s) and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. The Contractor(s) shall communicate with other contractors in order to coordinate projects.  It is highly unlikely that any work assigned under a specific task order will require the Contractor to work completely independently of AHRQ. 

The Contractor(s) shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables.  For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

SECTION D - PACKAGING AND MARKING

The contractor shall mark each delivery/deliverable with the Contractor’s Name; Contract and Task Order number; Item number; and quantity indicating partial, full or final shipment.  Note as appropriate on the face page of each deliverable, or on the binding, (1) one volume only, or (2) volume 1 of 2.

As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use – Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1) (A) and (1) (B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b) (1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1) (C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1) (C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	The Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(3)	If the AHRQ COTR does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However, the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. 

(d)  Copyright – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contract Specialist, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c) (1) (i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Government’s stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2	 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.  

H.3	SUBCONTRACTS

The contractor must include in any subcontracts executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract the terms of requirements H.1, H.2, H.3, and H.6.   These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause may be included to diminish these requirements.

Award of any subcontract is subject to the written approval of the Contracting Officer upon review of the supporting documentation as required by FAR Clause 52.215-12, Subcontractor Cost or Pricing Data, of the General Clauses incorporated into this contract.  A copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contract Specialist.

H.4	LATE PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT

Late payment of debts owed the Government by the Contractor, arising from whatever cause, under this contract/order shall bear interest at a rate or rates to be established in accordance with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual.

	a.	The basis of indebtedness.
	b.	The amount due.
	c.	The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.
	d.	The approximate interest rate that will be charged.

H.5	PRIVACY ACT

The Privacy Act clauses cited in Section I (FAR 52.224-1 and 52.224-2) are applicable to the consultant records kept by the Contractor for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she can be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract closeout is completed and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.
H.6  	SALARY RATE LIMITATION

Pursuant to the applicable Public Law cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts.  However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants.  If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

H.7	PRO-CHILDREN ACT of 1994

The Pro-Children Act of 1994, P.L. 103-227, imposes restrictions on smoking where certain federally funded children’s services are provided.  P.L. 103-227 states in pertinent part:

“PHS strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the non-use of all tobacco products.  In addition, P.L. 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.”   
	
H.8	PROTEST

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a Task Order under this contract except on grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.

H.9	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board’s Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board’s standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

H.11	OPTIONS

Pursuant to clause FAR 51.217-9 in section I, the Government may by unilateral contract modification, require the Contractor to perform any, all or none of the option periods of the Statement of Work as also defined in Section C of this contract.  If the Government exercises these options, notice must be given at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of this contract.

H.12 TASK ORDERS
All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs).  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.  

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

Under this IDIQ contract, Master Contract Holders are guaranteed a Minimum of $25,000.00 in Task Orders, while the absolute Maximum guaranteed to any single Master Contract Holder is the Program Maximum of;  $58,000,000.00. 

Task orders issued under this contract will last between twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being eighteen (18) months.  There may be circumstances where the duration of task orders may be longer or than the averages listed above.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

 Procedures for Issuance of TOs

1.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on technical merit, past performance, cost, and any other relevant factors.
		
2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee

3.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

			     E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $3000.

4.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

	--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

	--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

5.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

6.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

7.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

8.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

9.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

10.       Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily
electronically through e-mail or internet but they can be issues by facsimile or mail. Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities. Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that— 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals— 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 
K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

(c)	The Contractor shall include this clause in every subcontract and purchase order that is subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this contract.

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

L.3	INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (MAY 2001)	ALTERNATE I (JAN 2004)(FAR 52.215-1) 
(a) 	Definitions. As used in this provision --
“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.”
“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.
“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations.
“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.
(b) 	Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).
(c) 	Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
(1) 	Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages
(i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and
(ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision.

(i) 	The solicitation number;
(ii) 	The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);

(3) 	Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
(i) 	Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification, or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.
(ii)	(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --
(1)	If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(2) 	There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(3)	 It is the only proposal received.
(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(iii) 	Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(iv) 	If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(v) 	Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
(4) 	Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.
(5) 	Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.
(6) 	Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

(e)	 Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.
(ii)	 The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.9	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction

The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum 
requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  Special attention is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions:     
         
	a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, task order type contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.  To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

		I.	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.

II.	PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.11) 

III.	SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN: See Small Disadvantaged Business Plan Instructions for format (L.12) 

IV.	BUSINESS PROPOSAL:  See Business Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.13).

	c.	Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 3 parts:  

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; (3) Small Business Participation Plan; and (4) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

L.10	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS
To facilitate proposal evaluation, the Offeror shall submit, as part of the proposal, a separate section entitled Technical Proposal.  The data and information contained in the Technical Proposal shall be keyed to each paragraph of the technical proposal requirements as outlined in this section.  All pages must be numbered.  

The submission must be specific to the requirements in this request for proposal. 
Failure to comply with any aspect of this technical proposal instruction may result in the proposal being considered non-responsive.

The technical proposal described below shall be limited to 40 pages not including resumes or bibliographies, with no less than an 11-point pitch, with the majority of the text double-spaced. Resumes or CVs are required only for key personnel and should not exceed 10 pages each.  Brief biographic sketches of other personnel may be provided but should not exceed ½ page.  Lengthy proposals and voluminous appendices are neither needed nor desired as they are difficult to read and evaluate, and may indicate the offeror’s inability to concisely state their proposal. 

Recommended Technical Proposal Format

The offeror’s proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.  Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of the Agency’s scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed.”  The technical proposal must include a detailed description of the techniques and procedures to be used in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the requirements of the Agency’s scope of work.  

		(1)	Cover Page:  The name of the proposing organization, author(s) of the technical proposal, the RFP number and the title of the RFP should appear on the cover.  One (1) manually signed original copy of the proposal and the number of copies specified in the RFP cover letter are required.

4.  Concept for an RFTO, Technical Assistance to Support Research on Complex Patients

The Offeror shall submit a 5-7 page concept describing how they would respond to a potential task order as described below; the concept should describe how the Offeror would implement a two year project to start in the fall of 2010: 

&#61607;	Year 1: Offeror will establish a learning collaborative for approximately 50 researchers.  These researchers have been awarded either developmental grants (R21) or infrastructure grants (R24) to enhance understanding of how to optimize prevention and care management for complex patients (i.e., those patients with one or more chronic conditions).  One function of the learning collaborative will be to share study design, methodology and results among the researchers.  While united by the common theme of the complex patient, researchers’  patient populations and methodological approaches may differ substantially, and they may be at different stages in their research (e.g., a subset will be just starting their studies, while a smaller subset will be just finishing their studies). The Offeror also will use the learning collaborative to help grantees comply with any reporting requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The Offeror should assume that the grantees will be convened at least once a year in person, and the Offeror will collaborate on the agenda, meeting materials and will arrange logistics.     

&#61607;	 Year 2: The Offeror will provide direct technical assistance to a subset of grantees described above (Year 1) who have been awarded infrastructure grants.  Under this R24 grant opportunity, successful applicants will either develop a dataset or a new method for studying complex patients.  Grantees are required to ensure that the new datasets are publicly available for other researchers to use.  The Offeror will provide direct technical assistance to these researchers on creating a public use dataset (e.g., developing user manuals and codebooks to assist in creating datasets with de-identified data, and in posting datasets for public access [e.g., outside of the hosting institutions electronic firewalls] ). 

&#61607;	Year 3: Offeror will disseminate the results of individual grantees as well as disseminate the public use datasets to a broad audience of researchers.  Activities could include, but are not limited to: synthesizing results from grantees, “translating” results and creating products for multiple audiences including primary care providers, policy-makers, and researchers; creating materials for AHRQ’s Website; hosting webinars for researchers to describe the available datasets, etc.   

For the purposes of this exercise, offerors may assume a total project budget of approximately $1million per year for three years.

	L.12 	SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN
	
	In accordance with FAR Part 15.304(c)4, the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the contract shall be evaluated in unrestricted acquisitions expected to exceed a total estimated cost of $550,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.201 and 19.1202). 
	A.	All offerors, regardless of size, shall submit the following information in 1 original and 9 copies.
	
		A plan on the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business concerns in performance of the contract.  Participation in performance of the contract includes the work expected to be performed by SDB concern(s).  This can include SDB (as prime contractor), joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and subcontracts.  Include the following information in SDB participation plans:

		1.	The extent of an offeror’s commitment to use SDB concerns.  Commitment should be as specific as possible, i.e., are subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc.  Enforceable commitments will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones.
		
		2.	Specifically identify the SDB concerns with point of contact and phone number.
	
		3.	The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform.
	
		4.	Realism for the use of SDB in the proposal.
	
	5.	Past performance of the Offeror in complying with subcontracting plans for SDB concerns.
			
		6.	Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for each participating SDB; which will be incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract.
	
	7.	The extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the total acquisition.
			
B.	SDB participation information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror’s relative rankings will be compared to assure the best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates realistic commitments to use SDB concerns relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under consideration.  The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the offeror.  Also, references other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the offeror’s commitment to SDB participation.

B.    Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  

All offerors except small businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, with their Proposal. A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed in the offeror’s format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan when requested by a specific RFTO, the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without further consideration. 

This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  This provision does apply to all other offerors, including large business concerns, colleges, universities and non-profit organizations.

		The term “subcontract” means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.  This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/ purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment purchase, copying services, and travel services.

c.	If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.

d.	Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

e.	It is the offeror’s responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offeror’s plan will be judged independent of the other.

f.	The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.  Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government Contract Specialist or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractor’s designated small and disadvantaged business liaison.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on evaluation of proposals against four (4) factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.  The four factors are: (1) Technical Merit, (2) Past Performance, (3) Business Size, and (4) Cost. Following the evaluation, scores will be arrayed and a competitive range may be established.  Following evaluation and negotiations, should technical quality between Offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost may become the determining factor in award selection.  The Government reserves the right to make a best value award, cost and other factors considered.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective contractors in relation to the needs set forth in this solicitation.  The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.  Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of this solicitation.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below. Offerors must possess, either in-house or through existing subcontracts, the capabilities to perform all of the different types of services sought through this contract.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBA’s PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _30__% for small business (SB), _11_% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _3__% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ___5__% for women-owned business (WOSB), __3__% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the following goals, at a minimum, _____% for small business, ____% small disadvantaged business, ____% for HubZone businesses, ______% for   woman owned businesses, and ______% for veteran-owned businesses.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal. 

NOTE TO CONTRACTORS:  Please provide your CCS number with your Dun & Bradstreet number.

9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, HubZone small, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.

ATTACHMENT 5
AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQ’s Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market  Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM-TACs) products and findings.
                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makers—including patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakers—with up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management.

<DESC>This notice replaces the previous posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005.  The Department of State (DOS) removed the previous www.fbo.gov posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005 for administrative convenience. DOS still considers SAQMMA10R0005 as an active solicitation and all dates and timelines including the mandatory synopsis period remain in effect.  

DOS  will now consider requests to attend the mandatory preproposal conference received by 1:00pm EDT Monday April 26.  


NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010)

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. 
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 

At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 
A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and
B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and
C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and
D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and
E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and
F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. 

SPECIAL NOTES: 
1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 
2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract. The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. 

The Question and Answer (Q &A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 26, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date. Parties attending the pre-proposal conference may submit questions in writing at the end of the conference. Interested parties may submit additional questions up to May 12, 2010; 5:30 PM EDT. DOS will post answers to questions received at the conference and any additional questions via www.fbo.gov. 

Attendance at the site visit/preproposal conference is MANDATORY. DOS will reject proposals received from offerors who did not attend the site visit/preproposal conference. DOS intends to hold the conference in the Rosslyn area of Arlington, VA on Tuesday April 27 and Wednesday April 28. Offerors interested in attending must preregister by Monday 4:00pm Friday April 25, 2010. All interested parties SHALL FOLLOW-UP the e-mail correspondence with a phone call to Thomas C. Lemole at (703) 875-5852 to confirm receipt of the e-mail and to receive additional details and instructions concerning the site visit/preproposal conference. 
No more than three (3) representatives from each firm (to include potential subcontractors) may attend the site visit/preproposal conference. Interested parties SHALL BE READY to give Thomas C. Lemole notice of their interest by providing the name of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and Cage Code of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested parties who do not preregister WILL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. 
Offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this synopsis by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.fbo.gov to see if there are any changes.

Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), SBSS F/O Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire a second SBSS satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. SBSS F/O is an Acquisition Category ID program. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel.
<p>The objective of SBSS F/O is to deliver space surveillance capabilities to address the SSA needs of the warfighter. The SBSS F/O mission is to collect metric position and Space Object Identification data on manmade Resident Space Objects. SBSS F/O will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to serve users who require SSA of deep-space and near-earth resident objects. SBSS F/O will be part of a "Family of Systems", interoperable with existing systems, and enhancing the global reach of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence for Air Force Space Control. The F/O capability will be fielded to mitigate the end of life of the SBSS Block 10 satellite, and the acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in 2nd qtr FY11 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years. Proposal instructions and timelines will be communicated via the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>In order to receive the bidder's library password, a copy of any secret collateral documents, and participate in future Industry Days, potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 30 April 2010 to Jim Austin at <a href="mailto:james.austin@losangeles.af.mil">james.austin@losangeles.af.mil</a> who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret Technical Requirements Document (TRD) to an authorized facility. Response to this notice from small and small disadvantaged businesses qualified to prime this opportunity is encouraged.</p>
<p>Potentially interested prime contractors will be invited to attend our planned Industry Day(s). Our first Industry Day is tentatively planned for 18 May 10. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to six attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, a SF86 that is signed/dated within the last year, a JPAS printout and evidence of a local records check in the last year. If a person is currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, the SF86 is current within the last year and the local records check was accomplished within the last year, then only a PAR with JPAS printout is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Industry Day". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one or two page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments along with any subsequent document releases will be attached and posted under this GPE, https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The SMC Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. <br />Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), SYSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>

<DESC><BR>1.  Can it be broadband or satellite? <BR><BR>ANSWER  Yes, it can be either.<BR><BR>2.Is the contract award going to based on Best Value or Lowest Price?<BR><BR>ANSWER - See below clause, FAR 52.212-2.<BR><BR>3.  If it is best value, what are the evaluation criteria and how are they weighted?<BR><BR>ANSWER - See below clause, FAR 52.212-2.<BR><BR>4.  The original SOW asks for 5 X-Ray machines in the supply list, however, Q3 answer in the Q&A states, Need the ability to do intra- oral X-Ray in each exam room. With 6 buildings and 3 exam rooms per building, that's 18 exam rooms. Doesn't this also mean 18 X-Ray machines?<BR><BR>ANSWER -  YES, EACH EXAM ROOM NEEDS AN X-RAY MACHINE. WE NEED 18 FOR THE FIRST EXERCISE.<BR><BR>5. The following clause is hereby incorporated in full test <BR>FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JANUARY 1999) <BR>(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers- 1) Technical Capability of items offered to meet the Governments requirement 2) Past Performance and 3) Price. These factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Technical and past performance, when combined are more important, when compared to price.<BR>  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received <BR><BR>6.If portable office trailers are acceptable for your solicitation will they be allowed to remain in place in between the 2 events? It seems that there would be a risk to both the contractor and the government if the equipment is left in an unsecured or maneuver area. I just want to ensure that each vendor captures all of the associated costs while meeting the intent of the government.<BR><BR>ANSWER  No, contractor cannot leave equipment between the two exercises.<BR><BR><BR><BR>In order to meet mission requirement, the cut off for questions is now set at 23 April 2010 proposals are due 27 April 2010 @ 4:30 PM.  We have a few more questions to answer, and they will be posted on Monday, 26 April 2010.<BR>

The funds are targeted to support technical assistance efforts and expansion of the use of social media.  The improvements to the Workforce3One platform would provide virtual targeted trainings and technical assistance to the public workforce system regarding workforce strategies to support the economic recovery and implementation of ARRA, including Webinars and the expansion of online communities of workforce development professionals.  These virtual communities will help engage the workforce system in sharing best practices and information, and collecting and hearing reactions on policy ideas. 

FAR Subpart 16.6 indicates that a labor hour/time and materials contract is only appropriate when “it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate the extent or duration of the work, or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.”  At the time of award, neither the Program Office nor the Contracting officer can determine the amount of support required with any reasonable degree of confidence.

RECOVERY


On February 17, 2009 the Department was awarded $750 million of Recovery Act funding for a program of competitive grants for worker training and placement in high growth and emerging industries.  DOL intends to use a portion of the funds to provide technical assistance for this program of grants to support a total at least 250 new grantees. 

Following the ARRA grant announcements, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) will host comprehensive orientation training for all new grantees to ensure that grantees, especially those that have never administered Federal funds, fully understand the fiscal, administrative, and programmatic requirements for their grants.

<DESC>RECOVERY



In the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 training activities may include on-the-job training (OJT) (Sec 134 (d)(4)(D) of WIA.)  A survey by the National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) indicated that the paperwork burden to employers was a major barrier to implementing OJT programs at the local level.  

In order to encourage the implementation of OJT to get individuals back to work while receiving valuable training and skill up-grading, the Employment and Training Administration is using  $500,000 in ARRA technical assistance funds to create OJT templates and tools targeted to high growth sectors.  

New York, Missouri, and Oregon have agreed to provide policies, procedures, templates, monitoring documents, and guidance to inform this technical assistance strategy.  The contractor will work closely with ETA staff and state points of contact to ensure that deliverables are in line with expectations of federal staff. 

All documents produced should be concise, comprehensive, and easily transferable to all states regardless of level of expertise.  

All deliverables must be web-based, download-able, and hosted on workforce3one.com

<DESC>RECOVERY: The Eastern Region of the US Forest Service (R9) has approximately 17,000 miles of trail divided into approximately 11,000 trail segments.  Trails have Trail Management Objectives (TMOs), which are fundamental building blocks for trails management.  TMOs must be in place prior to additional trail inventories.  Trail inventories, assessments and identification of tasks provide managers with an opportunity to make sure that they have a current, working knowledge of their trail systems.  These surveys are called Trail Assessment and Condition Surveys (TRACS).  The TRACS inventory system is a method for gathering credible data on National Forest system trails in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. This project includes approximately 2,773 miles of various trails on the forests listed on the schedule of items.

PROJECT LOCATION:The project is located on a variety of National Forest (NF) system trails within the Allegheny National Forest (NF), Hoosier NF, Huron-Manistee NF, and Wayne NF. 

THIS PROCUREMENT IS HEREBY "100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES"

This project is funded in whole by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. (ARRA)

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), Virginia, 22448 seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information contained herein. NSWCDD seeks a vendor to provide a Commercial off-the-Shelf (COTS) or mature developmental item that will meet the following performance requirements.
RequirementsNSWCDD seeks a vendor to provide GPS receivers suitable for use as an embedded navigator in an 81 millimeter (mm) mortar in a technology demonstration program. As a technology demonstration, some of the ultimate military tactical requirements may be waived for expediency or convenience. Figure 1 attached identifies the critical parameters for this effort, with "threshold" designating the minimum acceptable performance of the receivers to be purchased and "objective" designating the expected performance in the final tactical implementation. The attached Requirements table (Figure 1) includes the list of minimum requirements, and the objective requirements. The Vendor Specifications table (Figure 2) will need to be completed by the vendor.
SizeThe objective design "space claim" is for a 40 mm diameter circuit board, with height depending on whether or not anti-jam protection is included (single versus two board stack). For the threshold requirement, any receiver which fits within a 60 mm diameter circle is preferred. However, any form factor with a minimum dimension of 60 mm will be considered.
ShockThis receiver is intended for use in an 81 mm mortar application. The mortar is explosively propelled from the launch tube and experiences a severe "setback" environment of 10,000 - 20,000 Gs for a brief duration (approx 10 milliseconds). After launch, the accelerations are small due to the modest control surfaces acting to guide the round to the target.
Note: maximum height and velocity during the technology demonstration are expected to be below the COCOM (Combatant Command) export restrictions for commercial receivers of 18 km and 515 m/sec.
Time to Usable Navigation (TTUN)The "time to usable navigation" is defined as the maximum expected time between application of valid power and output of navigation data within specified accuracy.
For the technology demonstration it is expected that the GPS receiver will be powered and navigating prior to launch. It is not a requirement to navigate through the launch event (acceleration is extreme and antennas will be briefly masked (for less than 1 second)). In the tactical use, the mortar (and receiver) will be provided with initialization data consisting of satellite broadcast data, cryptographic keys, time of day and a 10 pulse per second frequency reference for oscillator calibration. Initialization will be maintained in data hold for up to five minutes prior to launch.
Other considerations It is beneficial to the 81mm mortar effort if a path from technology demonstration to objective tactical use is defined. For that reason, secondary consideration will be given to receivers that currently have or are planned to have the following: L2 capability, P(Y) capability, M-Code capability, Direction Finding capability, Uplink capability, trajectory aiding capability, anti-jam protection, severe electromagnetic environment survivability, dedicated onboard processor for user apps (preferably compatible with commercially available support tools), output of pre-PVT (Position, Velocity, Time) data (e.g. pseudo range).
Peripheral SupportAdditional consideration will be given to vendors who provide documentation of peripheral support in the following areas:
.  Vendor has unique software capabilities and functions 
.  Vendor can supply developed interface and diagnostic software 
.  Vendor can supply a user interface kit
.  Vendor can supply user and technical manuals
.  Vendor can supply technical assistance to aid in the integration of the vendor's receivers into specific test platforms.
The vendor shall complete the Vendor Specifications table attached, provide a rough estimate of the cost per unit, delivery time after receipt of order, provide legacy/history of the product (i.e. product maturity and uses on other programs, if applicable), and if a COTS item - the part number. The expression of interest shall adhered to a five (5) page submission limit, plus any commercial marketing information, brochures, or web links. This market research announcement is not considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for proposal requirements.

<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is currently working to expand the services available to the Department through the use of Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts. The DHHS intends, through this procurement, to increase the number of Contractors and resources available to provide required services to ASPE in an effort to help them achieve their individual agency missions in a timely manner. Work under this task order contract will support the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and specifically the Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy&rsquo;s (DALTCP), planning, policy research, and evaluation activities. DALTCP is responsible for the development, coordination, research, and evaluation of Health and Human Service (HHS)/ Office of Secretary (OS) policies and programs that support the independence, productivity, health and security of people with disabilities, including children, working age adults, and older persons. DALTCP is also the lead office within HHS/OS for policy research and analysis related to international disability, aging issues, and long-term care. Within the Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy and Data Analysis ID/IQ task order contract, the Contractor shall provide expertise in policy development and analysis; demonstration and evaluation design; program assessment and evaluation; and data infrastructure development and modeling. In conjunction with these services, the Contractor shall provide organizational and logistical support for conferences, meetings, and other events to assist in the development and dissemination of the deliverables produced under this ID/IQ. Logistical support may entail making travel arrangements, securing hotel accommodations and meeting space, editing and report formatting, and providing technical expertise in support of conferences (e.g., agenda setting, recruitment of expert presenters, and preparation of conference papers and materials). An individual delivery order may require expertise in only one area of expertise or a combination of areas. This will be a multiple award contract. The duration of this contract is anticipated to be five years. The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available through the internet at www.fedbizopps.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Contractors are encouraged to sign-up, on the fedbizopps.gov website, for email notification of all actions relevant to this solicitation, and on the interested vendors list, also listed at the bottom of this announcement. The anticipated date for release of a solicitation is approximately 15 days from the date of this notice. No questions will be entertained at this time. Once the solicitation is released, offerors will be given an opportunity to ask questions and answers will be posted to <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">www.fedbizopps.gov</a>.&nbsp; NOTE: THE SOLICITATION NUMBER IS 10-233-SOL-00122.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis to conduct the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for the 2012 and 2013 survey years.  The purpose of the NSDUH is to provide current data on substance use and mental health prevalence for the U.S. population (aged 12 and older), each state and the District of Columbia, and to issue reports on survey results.  The survey sample will support annual estimates of prevalence for the nation, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia.  The contractor will be required to: (1) provide interviewers and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 182,500 dwelling units and conduct 67,500 interviews per survey year, using computer-assisted interviewing technology; (2) develop training procedures/materials and conduct training classes in order to maintain a qualified field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) use statistical expertise to (a) employ a state-based sample design, with an independent, multi-stage area sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and (b) employ small area estimation techniques in order to develop model-based estimates; (4) perform technical writing, analysis, and methodological studies to complete and support the contract tasking; (5) conduct a Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) comprised of 500 SCID interviews in each survey year and calibrate existing serious mental illness (SMI) estimation methods, as necessary; and (6) in survey year 2012, conduct an expanded MHSS (EMHSS) comprised of an additional 1,000 SCID interviews.  The estimated period of performance for items 1-5 is 56.5 months.  The estimated period of performance for item 6 is 36 months. 

RECOVERY:  The EMHSS activities described under item 6, above, will be funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds through Intra-Departmental Delegation Authority, or IDDA.  Through the use of ARRA funds, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to fund the EMHSS, to include: the expanded sample; a study aimed at assessing the feasibility of adding an adult and youth longitudinal follow-up study to the NSDUH; production of analytic and methodological reports on a variety of topics using existing data from NSDUH and other data systems, as appropriate; and an assessment of the feasibility of producing a data enclave for the MHSS data. 

NIMH has an interest in this MHSS expansion due to a desire to increase the NIMH research portfolio in population-based mental health studies that build on established federal surveillance survey platforms.  NIMH plans to use results from this MHSS expansion to analyze and report on major mental health conditions (e.g., Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Manic Episode, Anorexia Nervosa) based on data collected from a nationally representative sample.  NIMH is also interested in assessing the feasibility of developing a longitudinal component (i.e., the same respondents interviewed on different occasions) and in the production of an additional number of analytic and methodological reports to address their mission. 

The solicitation may be obtained in either of two ways:  by mail, or electronically by downloading a file from FedBizOpps.  Once downloaded, you should determine if you have a continuing interest in the RFP.  If so, you must either write the individual identified below and request that a copy of the amendments (if any) to the RFP be sent to you by mail, or check FedBizOpps regularly for the amendments.  You may choose either of the two methods for obtaining the RFP and amendments.  Note:  If you rely on FedBizOpps for obtaining amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assumes no responsibility for assuring, that you have downloaded these amendments.  All requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Fax requests will be accepted at (240) 276-1510, but please confirm by phone that your fax request has been received.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted.  Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth (20th) day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of proposals.  Pickups will not be permitted.  Reference RFP No. 283-10-0357.

<a href="mailto:melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>SEE UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM ON THE SYNOPSIS<BR><BR>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued on or before 03 May 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.5 for VOSB; and (6) at least 2.0% for SD VOSB.  SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA: The Government intends to provide a stipend in the amount of $500,000 to the Phase II unsuccessful offerors.  Offerors must make it to Phase II in order to be considered for stipend. <BR><BR>PRE PROPOSAL CONFERENECE<BR>The Government will hold a preproposal conference on 3 May 2010, 8:30 a.m. Central Time, Airport Hilton (901 Airline Drive) Kenner, LA, 70062.  Sign in to begin at 8:00 am. with the conference beginning at 8:30 am.  It is encouraged that all prospective Offerors attend.

Written questions must be received no later than three (3) days prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The submission of written questions will not preclude anyone from posing questions during the conference.
