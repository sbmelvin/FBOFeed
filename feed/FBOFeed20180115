<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), promotes United States innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.
<p>The Emergency Services Office (ESO) is responsible for delivering effective and efficient emergency and or electronic security services for the protection of NIST personnel, facilities, property, and activities for both the Gaithersburg, MD, and Boulder, CO campuses. ESO is responsible for all electronic security oversite which includes the management, evaluation, testing and control of NIST's electronic physical security activities. ESO also manages the NIST Continuity of Operations Program (COOP). This program includes coordinating the efforts of NIST's Emergency Planners/Coordinators, maintaining the NIST COOP Plan, conducting training, and preparedness exercises.</p>
<p>ESO provides security monitoring protection by means of a Physical Access Control System (PACS), along with a Pelco Endura Video Management System (VMS) for site access control to physical resources located in a multiple-building, 600-acre research campus located in Gaithersburg, MD. NIST ESO is solely responsible for the systems. The systems are accredited information technology systems that are certified to operate on-site at NIST.</p>
<p>The database contains information subject to the Privacy Act, as well as controls for the protection of high value assets and classified material. The PACS system was installed and became operational in 2002, and resides on an isolated TCP/IP network. It provides access control, ID video-badging, alarm monitoring, intrusion detection, and other asset protection. Access to the PACS system support components such as the network, routers, and server requires supervised administrative access and is highly restricted.</p>
<p>On August 27, 2004, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD), HSPD-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors was promulgated. This directive has been implemented and maintained by all Federal agencies. To ensure Government-wide interoperability, all departments and agencies must acquire products and services that are approved to be compliant with the standard and included on the approved products list.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) certifies and maintains the approved products list (APL). The APL can be found on https://www.idmanagement.gov/ IDM/IDMFicamProductSearchPage. The products found on the APL are related to PACS Infrastructure and PACS PIV Readers. The primary components are Lenel access control boards, and HID card readers currently in use on the NIST Gaithersburg campus.</p>
<p>Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidelines require the annual review and mitigation of risks to maintain acceptable risk levels in a cost effective, timely, and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to establish a single indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract to support the current infrastructures as well as new security installations on the NIST campuses.</p>
<p>All new and existing security system infrastructure for the PACS, video management systems, all network devices including hardware, secure configurations, software, licensing, ancillary devices, as well as the NIST Cyberlock System and standalone KABA and Trilogy locks, as well as any remediation of deficiencies of these systems shall be covered under this IDIQ.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform specific work, in accordance with task orders issued. Task orders shall identify the specific work required and may be awarded on a firm fixed price and/or time and materials basis. Work shall be directly related to one or more of the specific requirements identified in the forthcoming statement of work.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 561621 with a small business size standard of $20.5 million. Simplified acquisition procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number <br />SB1341-18-RQ-0158.</p>
<p>Potential quoters shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each <br />potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately seven days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Please hold all questions until the solicitation has been posted and&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewed. </strong></p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Atlanta VA Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia is seeking sources to provide off-site readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Vet Center staff members or professional staff members of Psychiatry, Social Work, Psychology, or Nursing services. Readjustment counseling is counseling by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrist, or other qualified counselors, individually or in groups specifically directed at social, psychological or behavioral difficulties specifically related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life. Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran s job performance, educational pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.

Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual and group counseling, all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of combat war zone era veterans.

Specific Tasks.  The services shall not include general mental health services, but only provide readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment from military duty for example:

j.   Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract. Nonetheless contractors shall have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications and/or medical treatment.

Service providers must be physically located within 50 miles of Griffin, Georgia, Zip Code 30024. The geographical boundaries described here will be determined by Readjustment Counseling Service officials and local VA Medical Center officials.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 621330. The size standard is $7.5M. 
POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:
Company name, address, phone number, primary contact(s), e-mail address, DUNS number, and business type, e.g. Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, Woman Owned Small Business, etc. as defined by the applicable NAICS.
