The scope of work will include the installation of thickened exterior concrete walls and footings, column reinforcement, rehabilitation of diagonal steel bracing, beam connection strengthening, shear and diaphragm opening repairs, installation of new concrete shear walls, improvement of building separations, as well as non-structural repairs of partition walls and ceilings.

The upgrades for Building 50 consist of new exterior concrete shear walls and strengthening of some interior walls. Central hallway plaster walls and plaster ceiling on the 4th, 5th and 6th floor will be reinforced to prevent failure during a seismic event. The plaster ceiling and walls in the auditorium will be replaced with metal stud walls and a gypsum board ceiling.

Various upgrades for Building 74 will include supplemental vertical wall supports; new concrete shear walls at various locations in the building; diaphragm strengthening and steel bracing in several locations; and strengthening roof collector beam connections.

The estimated value of construction for both buildings is $8 to $10 million.

<DESC>Posting:  The Federal Aviation Administration intends to contract with Computer Data Source, Incorporated (CDS), on a single source basis, to provide maintenance support on the Remote Maintenance Processor Subsystem. This Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announcement is made pursuant to Section 3.2.2.4 of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) to advise interested parties of the decision to acquire maintenance services from a single source, CDS.  The FAA will extend the current contract period of performance with CDS from January 20, 2008 to July 20, 2008.  This interim action will allow the FAA time to hold a competitive acquisition for a follow-on maintenance contract. CDS was awarded the current contract in 2003 and is the only source capable of meeting the interim requirements by January 20, 2008 in a timely and cost effective manner.   Therefore, the FAA intends to award a firm fixed-price modification to contract DTFAWA-03-F-03004 to provide Remote Maintenance Processor Subsystem support and extend the contract period of performance to July 20, 2008.  Questions regarding this announcement should be submitted in writing to Maria.G.Florentino@faa.gov, or via facsimile at (202) 493-5031 no later than January 17, 2008 at 2:00 p.m.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Agilent Technologies, of Englewood, Colorado, for the acquisition of a Precision Semiconductor and Precision LCR Meter to be used in the Ceramics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole source determination is based on the need to maintain access to and compatibility with the existing Agilent?s E4980A and HP4156C.  In order to avoid programming issues, NIST requires equivalent replacements of existing Agilent equipment.  This is necessary to minimize the incompatibilities with the existing software currently in the laboratory.  Agilent has the knowledge and background to understand the software written for the existing hardware and to distinguish code compatibility with the new required equipment.  Agilent Technologies is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Precision Semiconductor and Precision LCR Meter.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is 6M.

The New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry, which currently contains information on 10,000 colonoscopies, provides valuable data on sessile serrated and other polyps. This procurement will entail an analysis of New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry data to identify patients who had a polyp removed between 1/1/05 ? 12/31/06. An analytic dataset that links information at the patient and polyp levels will be created and used to identify patients with sessile serrated lesions, as well as the incidence of advanced histology and the presence of other advanced lesions, in these patients. In addition, for patients with multiple colonoscopy reports, the evolution of polyps, including sessile serrated lesions, will be examined. 

To better understand the appropriate utilization of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, the contractor shall conduct an analysis of New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry data. The analysis shall document the prevalence of sessile serrated and other polyps among patients undergoing routine colonoscopy. The project will provide important preliminary data on both the emerging topic of sessile serrated lesions and other polyps by linking clinical information over time and examining patient characteristics to identify important variables for future research.  The contractor shall summarize their findings in a manuscript to be submitted for publication.

This requirement includes the following tasks:

1.	Create an analytic file from New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry data of patients who had a polyp removed between 1/1/05 and 12/31/06.
2.	Estimate the prevalence of sessile serrated lesions, advanced histology, and other advanced lesions among these patients.
3.	Develop a manuscript that summarizes study findings and is suitable for publication

The contractor shall direct the construction of the analytic file and the data analysis. The contractor shall draft a manuscript suitable for publication.

Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) is uniquely qualified to undertake this work, because the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry is housed at DMS.  Dartmouth Medical School is uniquely qualified to undertake the analysis of sessile serrated and other polyps using colonoscopy registry data.  Dartmouth Medical School is the only vendor known to the NCI researcher that can meet the above requirements.

The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on January 16, 2008.  For further information please contact Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Purpose of the Contract<BR>Strength Maintenance Divisions mission is to provide policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the States and Territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Philosophy. This philosophy is to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrition management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-service.<B R>The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for strength readiness between unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force. Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet the units strength objectives. There are thre e strength maintenance tenets:<BR>a.  Recruiting Quality Soldiers,<BR>b.  Retaining Quality Soldiers, and<BR>c.  Managing Attrition.<BR>The purpose of this contract is to acquire contractor support services to continue, improve, and develop innovative Army  National Guard Strength Maintenance Division (NGB-ASM) Recruitment and Retention programs.<BR><BR>Statement of Need<BR>The Army National Guard Strength Maintenance Division (NGB-ASM) requires contractor support services to continue, improve, and develop i nnovative Recruiting and Retention programs. These Recruitment and Retention programs respond to ARNGs foremost goal, which is to attain and maintain congressionally authorized end-strength.<BR>Currently, NGB-ASM contract service support uses various cont racting vehicles executed by multiple contractors. In contrast NGB-ASM desires to address the situation by having one integration contractor as the single focal point.  Simultaneously, NGB-AQ Contracting Division wants to introduce post-award competition b etween multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) services contractors to obtain improved cost and technical product. This situation also presents an opportunity to incorporate a partial small business set-aside among the multiple IDIQ awards.   NGB-ASM requires a solution that addresses both the single focal point and the competition requirements. <BR><BR>The integration contractor scenario addresses the NGB-ASM need for a single focal point to monitor all program activities, perform strategic market analysis, support strategic decision making, collect and report program performance metrics, and ensure consistent application of an overall consistent branding and message theme as determined in the Advertising contract. Basically the integrator se rves as NGB-ASMs Recruitment and Retention Program Management Office. The integrator is a mediator between NGB-ASM and the five IDIQ services contractors: it supports the NGB-ASM in evaluating the IDIQ services contractors technical and cost task proposa ls; it reviews all programs for NGB-ASM to ensure consistent branding and messaging irrespective of  the services contractor; it collects, analyzes, and reports services contractor performance metrics for NGB-ASM evaluation; when required, it supports NGB- ASM in preparing data to respond to Department of Defense and Congressional inquiries; and it performs unbiased strategic market analysis from a perspective that is independent from the IDIQ services contractors to support NGB-ASM strategic decision-making . <BR>NGB-ASM obtains support from any of the five IDIQ services contractors on a task order basis. As envisioned the five IDIQ services contractors have to compete for work by 1) submitting technical and cost proposals in response to NGB-ASM task requirem ents, or 2) submitting original proposals based on their own initiative. NGB-ASM, with support from the integration contractor, evaluates the proposals and awards the task to the service contractor who, based on their informed judgment, provides best value  to the Government.<BR><BR>NGB-ASM has determined that using two types of contractsone a single award contract with an integration contractor and another multi ple award IDIQ contract with five contractorsis the most effective way to achieve NGB-ASM goals. The integration contractor will institute a permanent organization staffed with full time subject matter experts, specialists, and managers. The IDIQ services  contractors will develop and implement a comprehensive set of programs that helps ASM meet their objectives. Each IDIQ contractor will be able to team with outside subcontractors and vendors to round out the full complement of skills required by this soli citation.<BR><BR>Consistent with performance-based contracting practices, NGB will define the work in terms of objectives rather than specific tasks. As a result, it then becomes the offerors responsibility to propose how the stated objectives would be ac hieved and to define the metrics to measure performance. Offerors may propose for the integration contractor role or the IDIQ services contractor role, but not both. The integration contractor acquisition will result in one contract being awarded under the  Small Business Administrations 8(a) Business Development program.<BR><BR>SET ASIDE CONSIDERATIONS<BR>1.   Integration Contract.  Procurement for Integration Contractor shall be set aside for competition among 8(a) vendors<BR> <BR>2.  IDIQ Service Provide rs Contracts.  If the Government receives 2 or more acceptable proposals from Small Businesses, the Government will award two or more IDIQ Service Provider Contracts to Small Business entities.   All other IDIQ Service Provider Contracts will be considered  full and open.<BR><BR><BR>INTEGRATION CONTRACTOR<BR>a.  Minimum Guaranteed Funding Amount: The contractor shall receive a minimum of $25,000 over the life of the contract. This is the total amount that will be paid to the contractor in the event that the total sum of all task orders issued under the contract does not equal the minimum amount specified.<BR>b.  Maximum Contract Amount: The total maximum contract amount is $33 million in task orders over the life of the contract. The contract establishes a to tal contract maximum capacity, without subdividing the capacity any further. <BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (INTERGRATION)<BR>C-1	GENERAL<BR>C-1.1	Background<BR>The National Guard Bureaus Army Strength Maintenance Divisions (NGB-ASM) mission is to provi de policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the states and territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Philosophy. Specifically, to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrition management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-service.<BR>The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for strength readiness between  unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force. Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet each units strength objectives. There are three strength maintenance tenets:<BR>?	RecruitingRecruiting Quality (Non-Prior and Prior S ervice) Soldiers,<BR>?	RetentionRetaining Soldiers who reach their Expiration Term of Service (ETS, and<BR>?	Attrition ManagementReducing Losses While Still Under Contractual Military Obligation.<BR>As part of these activities, the Army National Guard al so has a related objective, which is to capture and improve access to performance data and program data.<BR>The interaction of the NGB Army Strength Maintenance processes of Recruiting, Retention, and Attrition Management are shown in the following diagram . This diagram indicates the flow of combat-ready soldiers within the National Guard. It indicates how the processes of recruiting, retention, and attrition affect the end-strength objective. The Army National Guard has multiple related yearly objectives t hat it uses to while managing these processes to achieve the congressionally mandated end-strength objective.<BR>To support these three tenets, the NGB-ASM requ ires contractor support services to continue, improve, and expand current efforts and to create and develop innovative Recruitment and Retention programs. These must be achieved while demonstrating improved outcomes consistent with the National Guards thr ee tenets of Recruitment, Retention, and Managing Attrition and responding to ARNGs foremost goal:  to attain and maintain congressionally authorized end-strength.<BR><BR>C-1.2	Purpose <BR>The Recruiting and Retention contract period of performance expire s in February of 2007. However, various task orders from that contract have periods of performance that stretch out in to the middle of calendar 2007. In addition, other separate contracts that NGB-ASM intends to absorb into the new Recruitment and Retenti on contract have periods of performance that also spread across 2007. <BR>NGB-ASM has determined that using two types of contractsone a single award contract with an integration contractor and one a multiple award IDIQ contract with five contractorsare t he most effective way to achieve NGB-ASM goals.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expires on 10/31/2007.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST/II operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>Reposted to extend close date/time until 01/04.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement BAA 07-01.     This announcement amends NRL-Wide BAA07-01 posted on 29 December 2006, by restating the list of BAA topics valid through 31 December 2008, noting topic cancellations and revisions. The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. This BAA is a continuously open announcement valid through 31 December 2008. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of contracts. Grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions may also be awarded if appropriate. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit an initial proposal, including a rough cost estimate, to the technical point of contact for each topic. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit initial proposals as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/0708baa/baa.htm Cancellations and revisions to specific topics are noted within. Specific research topics of interest include:

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from ALL qualified small business firms (particularly 8(a), Women Owned, SBA Certified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 514210 ($6.5 million) which have the capability to perform the Maintenance and Fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support ? Household Components (HC).  The Contractor will be responsible for collecting editing and inputing data collected from Households.  The Contractor will also be responsible for survey weight and estimation variable development and construction as well as analytic file development, including documentation and codebooks. The contract will be performance based for an initial period of performance of three and one-half years with three one-year options.  

The primary objective of the MEPS HC is to provide high quality data that can be used to produce both point estimates as well as distributional estimates of health care use, medical expenditures, health insurance status and sources of payment for medical care.  In addition, the MEPS HC is designed to produce measures of health care quality associated with several high prevalence conditions.  The health care services use, medical expenditures, and health insurance data can also be linked to the demographic, employment, economic, and health status of survey participants.  The longitudinal feature of the MEPS HC permits analyses of transitions in health insurance coverage, health status, and other characteristics over a two year period. Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-HC which collects detailed information on health care use and payment for health care services from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.  In the MEPS HC, data are collected for each new sample (pane/ roundl) of households to cover a two-year period, and a new panel is started each year.  To produce health care estimates for a calendar year, data are combined across two distinct nationally representative MEPS HC samples.  More specifically, annual estimates are based on data from the first year of a current panel combined with data from the second year of a previous year?s panel.

Capable offerors must demonstrate they possess expertise in data collection (computer assisted and paper and pencil), statistical and analytical editing and imputation, survey weight and estimation variable development and construction, as well as analytical file development and documentation.  Respondents to this sources sought must demonstrate the following capabilities:  a) sample implementation and documentation; b) development of weights and variables for variance estimation; c) development of sampling unit data (geo-coding); d) development of materials and CAPI maintenance; e) interviewer recruitment and training for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4, and  Round 5; f) data collection for Round 1, Round  2, Round 3, Round 4, and Round 5; g) Spanish interviewer training and materials development; h) data processing; i) development of security plan; j) between round processing; k) forms control and receipt; l) data entry; m) data coding; and n) preparation and delivery of analytic files including archival versions of the full operational database, and point-in-time, full year use, full year use and expenditure, event, condition, jobs and a appendix files.  Offeror must also demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of how to develop an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC (Medical Provider Component ? to be a separate requirement) contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of CAPI applications, post data collection processing, and analytic editing and imputation tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data editing and imputation techniques proposed; the soundness of proposed weighting and variance estimation strategies and strategies to maximize survey response and minimize non-response bias; and  the soundness of the data management plan.  Examples of all of the above will be requested in the resultant RFP.   

The MEPS is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection (computer assisted and paper questionnaires) from household respondents of demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and sources of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment information.  In addition, respondents must demonstrate they have the expertise and experience in developing analytic files, including documentation of public use files, as well as survey weight and variance estimation development and construction, and analytical and statistical data editing and imputation. A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the contractor must demonstrate their capability to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.  Potential respondents are encouraged to visit the MEPS website at www.meps.ahrq.gov .  

Interested small businesses should e-mail their capability statements to Mary Haines, Contracting Officer at Mary.Haines@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 12 noon eastern time on November 26, 2007. Organization must tailor their capability statements to this request and must include their small business designation (i.e. HUBZone, 8(a), Women Owned, etc) on the cover page.

<SUBJECT>Q -- inmate inpatient and outpatient care
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, Duke University Medical Center is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, FMC Butner will proceed with the sole source negotiated with Duke University Medical Center.

<SUBJECT>D -- Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Modernization and Sustainment Support
<DESC>THE HQ AMC Contracting Flight intends to extend the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) contracts with The Federal Software Group (FSG), 2025 Craigshire Ct., St. Louis MO 63146 and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), 5501 Backlick Road, Suite 300, Springfield, VA to provide continued application upgrade/modernization and sustainment support including the following:  software development/maintenance (version releases/patches), Level III technical support, and government acceptance testing support.  This extension will bring the program to a minimally acceptable level of completion and fielding and provide the time necessary to develop, solicit, and award a competitive procurement for continued GDSS modernization and sustainment.  GDSS is the primary command and control (C2) system used to create and disseminate airlift and tanker mission plans to all Mobility Air Force (MAF) users.  Modernized GDSS is designed to combine Global Decision Support System (GDSS) capabilities and the Integration Management Tool (IMT) (legacy force-level system developed by FSG) and Command and Control Integrated Processing System (C2IPS) capabilities (wing-level system developed by CSC) into a single global integrated Mobility Air Force Command and Control system.  

The resultant contract extensions will be labor hour for an additional two (2) years.  The first period of performance will be for six months, 1 Mar 08 through 31 Aug 08.  The second period of performance will be for 1 year, 1 Sep 08 through 31 Aug 09.  The third period of performance will be for six months, 1 Sep 09 through 28 Feb 10, and is to focus on providing a transition period for a new contractor to build upon the existing GDSS code line.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511.  These requirements are sole source pursuant to the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), (award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling AF and DoD requirements).  A solicitation will not be released for these contract extensions.  The competitive acquisition effort is in the early pre-acquisition planning phase with a projected award by the end of the 18 month point (1 Sep 09) to start the 6 month transition period.  Verbal questions/requests will not be acted upon.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

STATEMENT OF WORK

RUNWAY RUBBER REMOVAL


1.	The work covered by this specification consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, materials, transportation, etc, that is required to remove 85-percent of the rubber buildup from 100-percent of the work area.  The work shall be performed on both asphalt and concrete surfaces.

2.	The rubber removal work shall be completed without damaging the pavement, joints, joint sealant, or any other government property.   If any damage does occur, the Contractor shall repair the damage as required, and in a manner approved by the Project Inspector.  

3.	Prior to the start of work, the Contractor shall attend an airfield safety briefing.  The Contractor shall follow all instructions given at this briefing.  If necessary, the Contractor will be provided with a radio at this time.  The Contractor shall return the radio at the end of the work.  The Contractor will also receive airfield passes for his vehicles at this time.

4.	The Contractor shall submit detailed information on the chemical composition of the product.  The Holloman AFB Environmental Flight will review the product to ensure that it meets all required regulations.  No product will be allowed for use on base until approval is received from the Environmental Flight.

5.	The equipment used for rubber removal work shall be mounted on pneumatic tires, and shall not cause damage to the pavement surface or joints.  The Contractor?s equipment shall also conform to the following requirements.  Experience has shown that these requirements are necessary in order to achieve a satisfactory end result.   

Broom for Scrubbing:  The broom fill shall consist of a steel and plastic bristle combination.  The minimum diameter of the broom core when new shall be no less than 30".  The core shall have a minimum of 700 pounds of wire bristles, and 100 pounds of plastic bristles. The minimum width of the broom core shall be 12'.  An all fiber broom will not be allowed.
	
Water Tanker for Rinsing:  The water pressure used for rinsing the pavement shall not exceed 50-psi.  The tanker shall have a minimum capacity of 8,000-gallons, and shall be capable of delivering rinse water at a minimum rate of 250-gallons per minute.  The discharge port shall be no less than 4" in diameter.

Chemical Applicator:  The chemical shall be applied with a low pressure sprayer.  The spray boom shall have a minimum width of 25'.  The nozzles shall be adjustable to prevent drifting of the chemical.

Magnet:  A magnet measuring at least 4" wide by 40" long shall be suspended beneath the rear of the broom to pick up any lost steel broom fibers.
  
6.	The removal of rubber deposits shall be accomplished by using a derubberizing compound specifically formulated and field tested for this purpose.  Typically, the areas to be cleaned are saturated with the cleaner, agitated by a mechanical scrubber using wire brushes, and rinsed with clean water.  The rubber removal chemical that will be specified for this contract is Avion 50, or approved equal.  Before an approved equal chemical will be allowed for use, it must be documented by field experience.  The contractor shall submit the names of at least five major civil airports or DoD bases where he has removed rubber successfully for at least two years using the proposed chemical.  The contractor shall provide a letter from at least three of the users stating that his work was satisfactory.  Holloman AFB may also require an on-site demonstration in addition to the above certification.  If an on-site demonstration is required, it shall be at no cost to the base.  

7.	The Contractor shall provide lighting as required.

8.	The Contractor shall begin work only when the air temperature is 40? F and rising, and when the pavement temperature is 35? F and rising.  

9.	Water will be provided to the Contractor at no cost.  The water source will be a fire hydrant located within the airfield.  The Contractor will be provided with a wrench for opening and closing the hydrant.  The wrench shall be returned when the work in complete.  When the hydrant is not in use by the Contractor, it shall be made available for emergency use by the base fire department.

10.	The Contractor will not be required to recover the chemical.  However, the Contractor shall flush all debris, waste, and by-products generated from the rubber removal process completely off of the pavement surface and onto the dirt.  The Contractor shall ensure that the dirty rinse water is not allowed to dry on the pavement and stain it.  If any rinse water stains do occur anywhere on the pavement surface, the Contractor shall clean the pavement until the stain is gone.  When cleaning is complete, there shall not be a dust film left behind on the pavement surface.  If any dust is present, the Contractor shall rinse the pavement until it is gone.  The Contractor shall also ensure that his rubber removal process does not discolor the pavement surface.  If any rinse water staining or discoloration does occur, the Contractor will be directed to stop work immediately and implement measures to correct the problem.   

11.	The work times and dates will be coordinated with the Contractor for each individual call.  However, the Contractor will generally not be allowed to work during the daytime hours on a normal workday.  The Contractor should expect that the work will occur during nights, weekends, or holidays.        

12.	The Contractor shall store his equipment and materials in areas designated by the base.  The storage area will be located somewhere within the airfield.

13.	Compliance with the 85-percent removal from 100-percent of the work area will be determined by direct testing within the designated work area.

13.1	A one square foot grid with 100 equal squares will be placed on the pavement surface at random locations.  The number of squares that contain rubber will then be counted.  The number of squares containing rubber deposits shall not exceed 15 in each of the randomly selected locations.    

13.2	Each work area designated for rubber removal will be divided into four equal zones for the purpose of compliance testing.  Within each zone, seven random, pre-selected locations will be evaluated.  Five of those locations will be located within 10' of the runway centerline.  At least six of the randomly selected areas within each zone must meet the requirement specified above.  Each zone will be evaluated independently.  A zone not meeting the 85-percent removal requirement shall be re-cleaned by the Contractor at his expense.

13.3	Deposits of rubber are defined as any surface deposit that can be removed by scratching the deposit with a sharp object (such as a pocket knife) without damaging the pavement surface.  Rubber stain is defined as materials in the pavement surface micro texture that cannot be removed without damaging the pavement surface.  Rubber stain is generally embedded in the surface of the pavement below the horizontal plane of the surface texture.   The Contractor will not be required to remove rubber stain.  Note that rubber stain is different from rinse water stain as defined in Paragraph 10.  (Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 97-17)

14.	The Contractor shall perform a complete cleanup of the work and equipment storage areas after the work is complete.  The Contractor shall ensure that no broom bristles are left on the runway.   

15.	The Contractor shall fill out the attached bid schedule.  There are two line items on the bid schedule.  One line item is for a trip charge, and one is for the rubber removal work.  The trip charge shall include all costs associated with travel, motel, per diem, etc, and all other costs not directly related to the rubber removal work.  The Contractor will be entitled to one (1) trip charge per call.  The rubber removal line item shall include only those costs directly related to the rubber removal work.  Payment to the Contractor shall be in accordance with the bid schedule.  The bid schedule prices shall include the appropriate tax.

16.	Prior to awarding the contract, the Contractor shall provide submittals on the proposed chemical and equipment that he intends to use on this contract.  The contract will be awarded only after the Contractor?s submittals have been approved.    

17.	Rubber removal work will generally take place on three runways.  The following information is provided.

?	Runway 16:  200' wide.  This runway is typically cleaned twice a year, and usually has heavy rubber buildup.
?	Runway 34:  150' wide.  This runway is typically cleaned once a year, and usually has light to moderate rubber buildup.
?	Runway 22:  300' wide.   This runway is typically cleaned once a year, and usually has light to moderate rubber buildup.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.
