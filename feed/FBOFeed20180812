<DESC>The Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Special Programs Office, Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CWT SatoTravel, of Arlington, VA, to provide travel services for the Organization of Scientific Area Committees.
<p>On February 4, 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced the formation of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) for Forensic Science. The OSAC is a collaborative body of approximately 560 forensic science practitioners and other experts who represent all levels of the government, academia and industry.</p>
<p>NIST established the OSAC to strengthen the nation's use of forensic science by supporting the development and promulgation of forensic science consensus documentary standards and guidelines. The ultimate objective of the OSAC is to create a sustainable organizational infrastructure that produces consensus documentary standards and guidelines to improve quality and consistency of work in the forensic science community.</p>
<p>OSAC-approved standards and guidelines are listed on the OSAC Registry which is publicly available.</p>
<p>The OSAC is made up of 34 OSAC units, which includes 25 Subcommittees, 5 Scientific Area Committees (SAC), 3 Resource Committees (RC) and the Forensic Science Standards Board (FSSB).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide travel planning and reimbursement for up to 600 non-federal participants, in the aggregate, for two meetings of the Scientific Area Committees and Subcommittees. Meetings will be held in November 2018 and December 2018.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING: <br />The work requires the Contractor to access and manage personally identifiable information (PII) that will be transmitted and stored electronically and/or in hard copy.</p>
<p>Extensive market research and procurement history have revealed only one fully qualified source. CWT SATO Travel is fluent with the work associated with travel planning and reimbursement, AND, as the basis for the sole source determination, the Contractor has been determined to be compliant with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, specifically, NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.</p>
<p>This compliance has been issued by the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Such compliance is required to ensure that appropriate security requirements and security controls are applied to all information and information systems utilized under any federal government contract.</p>
<p>Market research and procurement history have not revealed any other source with both the technical capability to perform the required work, <br />AND a current and valid Authorization to Operate (ATO) and/or FedRAMP authorization, in a moderate risk level<br />environment from a federal government agency.</p>
<p>All work must be completed in accordance with the business practices, and business processes approved within the Contractor's current authorization to operate.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by August 27, 2018, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>Any party responding to this notice must provide clear and specific evidence that they possess a valid and current ATO and/or FedRAMP authorization to operate in a moderate risk level environment from a Federal Government agency.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to compete this requirement.</p>
