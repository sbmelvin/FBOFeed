The Performance Based Service Contract provides potential Offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet the stated objectives.

Minimum acceptable levels of performance to meet the minimum requirements are outlined in the "Performance Work Requirements Summary" contained in an Attachment in the solicitation when it is issued.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:

Services include, but are not limited to, placement of initial and replacement of upright headstones (HS), destruction of replaced HS, preservation of existing Cemetery features (lawns, paving, roads, stones, and markers), restoration of Cemetery features disturbed or removed as a result of performing new work such that at the end of the day the Cemetery condition is as good as before commencement of work.

Work shall be performed in strict accordance with all terms, conditions, specifications, schedules and drawings. Performance shall be in accordance with the requirements, conditions, terms and representations contained in this solicitation, any pertinent OSHA Occupational and Safety regulations, and any State and/or local regulations, laws and codes.

Any amendments to the solicitation will also be available at www.fbo.gov.  Offerors are advised they are responsible for obtaining any amendments.  

Evaluation criteria for this award will be in the following order: 2 Rounds: the 1st round is based on price where a competitive range is established using various mathematical formulae and outliers may be removed for the competition. The second round is based on Technical Qualifications and Past Performance where they are equal in weight to each other. If proposal are rated equally then Price will determine the final outcome.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command, Tenant Contracting Division, Aberdeen Proving Ground intends to issue a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to, Health Research and Analysis (HRA), LLC, 5410 Edson Lane, STE 320G, Rockville, MD  20852, 3107. NAICS Code is 541990, Business Size Standard Size is 750.   The following special project will be procured: <br><br>A case control-design will be used to determine whether there is an association between use of stimulant containing performance enhancing/dietary supplements and greater risk of selected health outcomes (renal failure, hepatic failure, cardia arrhythmias, heat injuries, etc.)among soldiers.  The survey and analysis will control for confounding factors (physical fitness, body composition, past illnesses etc.) and other possible explanatory factors.  The plan is to deliver 6,000 to 7,000 surveys to soldiers.  <br><br>Data entry will be performed by the contractor for roughly 3,500 surveys and an automated database will be created.  Data quality for the surveys will be checked by the contractor.  The contractor will produce a data dictionary and an analysis plan.  The contractor will then perform both univariate/bivariate and multivariate analysis on the data.  The contractor will use the results of the analyses to produce a report of finds on the association of dietary supplement use and specified adverse health outcomes.<br><br>Surveys will be designed, delivered and collected by the Army Institute of Public Health,  The surveys have 50 close ended questions.<br><br>Health Research past performance demonstrates reliability, knowledgeable and completing tasks in a timely manner.  Because this is an investigation of a potentially burgeoning public health problem, Army Institute of Public Health have a short suspense for the collection and analysis of data and need to work with a known entity who can provide sound, reliable analyses quickly.  Health Research knows military data and epidemiology that can be relied upon to meet and satisfy this project quickly.  Failure to contract quickly with a known entity/conractor such as HRA could mean delays in data analysis and reporting that would slow decisions on how to prevent the adverse medical conditions that include serveral deaths and hospitalizations. There are no solicitation documents, however, contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. In addition, the response should include Offeror's Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)--Commercial Items in accordance to FAR 52.212-3. If the offeror does not have a copy of this provision, go to Federal Procurement Data System (SAM)https://www/uscontractorregistration.com to load required information. Any responses received without completing SAM registration will be considered noncompliant.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, CCAP-SCN, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Selex Communications Inc.<br><br>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement listed. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) requires additional prototypes developed under research and development contract W911QY-11-C-0050. The additional prototypes are required for additional testing by the United States Marine Corps. The prototype is a hearing protection/hearing enhancement communication system. The system includes a Push-To-Talk Box, ear bud, ear muff headset and cabling and manual.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Selex Communications Inc.  is the only manufacturer of the required helmets.  Selex developed this prototype design under contract W911QY-11-C-0050.  Since the prototype was designed under a research and development contract no other contractors have the ability to provide the government with the required prototype without extensive research and development. The prototype design and intent of the system does not exist outside of the government. Given the complexity of the system designs, materials and processes, it would not allow industry partners unfamiliar with any of these pieces enough time to meet the mission requirements of the government.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Market research was conducted for the competitively award research and development contract in which these helmet prototypes where designed. The market research led to a competitive contract award to Selex Communications Inc. for the design and development of the hearing protection and communications prototypes.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   <br><br>Selex Communications Inc. has been contracted to develop hearing protection and communications prototypes.  The WOLVERINE hearing protection and communications prototypes developed by Selex under the government contract is a prototype system developed exclusively for the government and paid for by the government.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>This is a follow on action to the research and development (R&D) contract so further testing can be done on the prototypes designed under the R&D contract.<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by sending responses to this requirement to the Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground CCAP-SCN, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail: Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil no later than 12:00 p.m. 6 September 2012.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground<br>CCAP-SCN, Natick Contracting Division <br>US Army Soldier Systems Center <br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact: <br><br>Sean Auld<br>Contract Specialist<br>Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract, on a sole source basis, with Elektrobit (EB) Corporation of Oulu, Finland for the purchase of an EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator under other than full and open competition. <br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(2) Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Advanced Network Technologies Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a Radio Frequency Channel Emulator capable of simulating either a fully-connected bidirectional mesh network with 8 nodes or an 8x8 MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) configuration. The EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator from Elektrobit Corporation is the only commercially available system that can meet NIST's requirements. Elektrobit Corporation holds the proprietary rights to the EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator. Therefore, Elektrobit Corporation is the only responsible source capable of providing the EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator. Elektrobit is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator. As a result, Elektrobit is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517919, and the size standard is $25.0M.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government. Best value consists of the offer meeting the technical capability to perform the services identified within the Performance Work Statement (PWS) (to include the attached pictures) at the lowest price.</p>
<p>Each Offerors quotation shall provide the following information:<br />(i) Price <br />(ii) Technical Capability <br />Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Award will be made to the offeror whose price is lowest among all quotations that were deemed to be technically acceptable. Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government. Best value consists of the Offeror's quotation meeting the technical capability shown within the PWS at the lowest price.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days prior to the last day of the period of performance for the contract. <br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within <br />30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION (JUNE 2007) <br />(a) Definitions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and  technically acceptable low bids/ past performance.
  The relative importance of the factors is as follows price more important than past performance. 

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.
 The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.
  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

Product No. DESCRIPTION

The Anesthesiology & Pain Management Service at the Dallas VA Medical Center needs to purchase a MRI compatible anesthesia machine to provide anesthesia to patients undergoing radiological scans. The type of machine required includes the following specifications:

1.  Developed for 1.5 Tesla and 3 tesla MRI environments / Distance to center of magnetic field: fringe field strength of 40 mtesla (400 gauss) or less

2.  Compact Breathing System

3.  High resolution 6.5” TFT color display and LED alarm indicators

4.  Vapor 2000 system

5.  Electronically controlled and driven, high-precision ventilator with volume controlled an pressure controlled modes

6.  Able to interface with the Draeger Innovian software currently used by all Anesthesia providers for electronic patient record documentation. 

Monitoring
Continuous monitoring of inspiratory O2 concentration, frequency, tidal volume, minute volume, mean or plateau pressure, peak airway pressure as well as PEEP. In addition, all fresh gas flow information is displayed as virtual flow tubes.

Serial interface 1 x RS 232 (standard)

Protocols Medibus

Volume of CO2 absorber 1.5 Liter, Option: Dräger Medical’s prefilled CLIC absorber

Volume of entire compact 1.7 Liter + bag breathing system

Gas supply from supplementary • with pin-index connections or MR compatible cylinders • with threaded connectors

Auxiliary Oxygen Flowmeter

Anesthetic Agent Vaporizer 
2 position Dräger mount

Dräger Isoflurane Vapor 2000, Dräger Sevoflurane Vapor 2000

S-ORC (Sensitive Oxygen Ratio Controller)

S-ORC is a control element which guarantees a minimum O2 concentration in the fresh gas flow.

As from a flow rate of approx. 200 mL/min., the N2O concentration in the fresh gas can be freely set between 0 and 75 %. During O2 shortage S-ORC limits the N2O concentration in the fresh gas, so that the O2 concentration does not drop below 23 vol.%. S-ORC prevents N2O flow, when N2O metering valve is open and O2 metering valve is closed or O2 flow is less than 0.2 L/min. During N2O failure O2 may still be administered. No alarm.

Range and accuracy of 0 to 10 L/min ±10 % of full scale at STP, total fresh gas flow meter calibrated with 50 % O2/ 50 % N2O gas mixture

0 to 10 L/min ±15 % of full scale at STP for all other gas mixtures

<DESC>AMENDMENT 00001, EFFECTIVE DATE = 9/1/2012  1.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer some questions regarding the solicitation;  1) Will the 3300 slides for scanning be submitted at a single time or will they sent to the vendor over a period of time? What rate will they be sent at? 	Ans. YES, THEY WILL BE SENT ALL AT ONE TIME.  2) How long must the data be stored? 	Ans. FOREVER.  3) What level of security is required on the server? Is the data considered classified? Is SSL connection satisfactory? 	Ans. IT NEEDS TO HAVE USERNAME/PASSWORD LEVEL.  THESE IMAGES ARE NOT CLASSIFIED.  WE WOULD REQUIRE TO ABILITY TO GRANT CONSULTANT ACCESS TO SELECTED IMAGES.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AN SSL CONNECTION IS...I AM SORRY.  4) Is there additional data that must be stored and accessible on the server? eg historical data generated by other vendors. 	Ans. NO  5) Are the 3300 slides everything that will scanned under the contract or is this a ballpark number used for the purposes of selecting a vendor? Might there be more or less?  Is this contract likely to lead to a longterm data generation and storage service? 	Ans. THIS IS A BALLPARK FIGURE.  FUTURE USE OF THIS SERVICE WILL BE ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE ON A CASES BY CASE BASIS.

<DESC>This is a notification of award pertaining to a limited-sources award for a two(2) month extension of a T&amp;M GSA FSS, IT Solutions&nbsp;Task Order No. 02FL2190808, Modification 11 to American Systems Corporation.&nbsp; The GSA contract task order was&nbsp;previously competively awarded under GSA Region 2 based in NYC, NY uder&nbsp;GSA FSS, contract No. GS-35F-4581G, an order originally awarded on behalf of the Army Material Command (AMC) with same functionality subsequently transferred to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), for procurement of Synchronized Predeployment Operational Tracker (SPOT) support. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The order will be placed on a <span style="COLOR: black">Time and Materials basis. The effort will be funded with OA&amp;M funds.<br /></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span>
<p>DMDC requested that GSA's Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) Division procure and award a two-month extension to the existing Task Order, 02FL2190808, for Synchronized Predeployment Operational Tracker (SPOT) support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The support will be provided to the Defense Manpower Data Center, which recently assumed responsibility for this project from AMC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The period of Performance for the extension is from September 1, 2012 through October 31, 2012 while&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">GSA Region 3 based in Philadelphia, PA continures and completes&nbsp;their procurement process for a new&nbsp;GSA contract task order award. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The GSA Region 2 based SPOT Modification 11 for the extension funded by&nbsp;DMDC has&nbsp;total&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 2">e</span>stimated costs of&nbsp;$2,153,470.02.&nbsp; The 2 month bridge extension is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) - An urgent and compelling need exists and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequences of not having an SPOT-ES Sustainment contract in place and fully supporting the requirements of DMDC will have a far-reaching critical impact within and outside of the DoD. DMDC is the steward of DoD personnel data. The SPOT-ES Sustainment contract ensures that the joint suite of enterprise systems employed for the management, tracking and visibility of contracted capability and contractors authorized to accompany U.S. forces overseas stays operational. Without these services, DMDC is at a risk for our systems to experience unnecessary outages causing in a loss of accountability of contractor forces overseas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Failure to have adequate SPOT-ES support for DMDC will impact all of the DoD as well as other Government agencies and entities. The services performed by out contractors are so critical that failure to extend the contract may results in non-compliance with DODI 3020.41, Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S Armed Forces, which requires the SPOT&nbsp;single joint database for logistics, operations, planning, and reporting of deployed contractor status to government and defense contractor stakeholders.</p>
<p>The extension period will allow DMDC the necessary time to award the follow on contract and allow for a 30-45 day transition time without endangering critical DoD programs directly supporting DoD employees, active, duty military, guard, reservists, and retirees.&nbsp; Failure to execute the extension will leave the SPOT-ES applications without any technical or call center support, potential removing the ability for our Armed Forces to generate any Letters of Authorization (LOAs). LOAs are the only accepted form for contractors authorized to accompany the forces.</p>
<p>Following the procedures for a new acquisition would result in unacceptable delays in arranging for contractor support to complete these requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government is following procedures in satisfying the long-term requirement, under GSA Region 3 RFQ ID03120056, which was competed amongst all Alliant contract holders, but which will not be awarded before August 31, 2012,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>which is the end of the current Period of Performance for 02FL2190808, thus allowing for an unacceptable gap in service for this critical requirement.<br /><br />Note:&nbsp; LSJ has been signed and approved by GSA Region 2 FAS, AAS&nbsp;senior management, Competition advocate and&nbsp;legal via GSA, FAS, AAS&nbsp;automated&nbsp;internal pre-award process known&nbsp;as eApproval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This order was placed in support of the Project Manager, Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program's PM AESIP.   Oracle America's "Oracle Premier Support for Systems" agreement will support software upgrades and 24x7x4 maintenance support for all hardware included under this order. The requirement is for 24 hour, 7 days per week, and 4 hour response time (24x7x4) technical support services and data retention for Sun hardware and equipment that will lose maintenance support in August 2012.  Maintenance requirements include:  24x7x4 on-site support; advance replacement parts with a Sun authorized Engineer, delivered within four (4) hours of determining that part replacement is required, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including locally observed holidays for onsite hardware maintenance; 24 x 7 phone support; enhanced case management capabilities allowing support with little to no information sharing; secure hardware and software installation, configuration, and updates to Sun products.   Hardware replacement minimizes the risk of potential network downtime with fast access to replacement of hardware parts. Only Oracle America Certified Partners/Resellers can support equipment failures and software upgrades to the associated hardware servers.  The order was a competitively awarded firm fixed price delivery order through the Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) program which is the Army's designated primary source for commercial IT.  In accordance with the CHESS ordering guidelines, the Fair Opportunity was given to all six ITES-2H multiple award contract holders.  A brand name justification is being posted with this announcement.  The period of performance of the requirement is August 31, 2012 thru March 31, 2013.  Market research revealed that more than one ITES-2H multiple award contract holder can provide the required support.  When this is true the procurement must be made from CHESS IAW AFARS5139.101.   Responses to this announcement must be emailed directly to Steve Perry, the Contract Specialist, at steven.r.perry32.civ@mail.mil.<br>
