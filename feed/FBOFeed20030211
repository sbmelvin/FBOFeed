<CONTACT>JEFF PALACHAT CONTRACTING OFFICER 9283438138     JPALACHAT@LC.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>NA The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, has a new requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC) advanced water treatment research facility located within the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) complex at 7301Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona.  The WQIC research facility includes: the Yuma Area Office (YAO) Analytical Laboratory; Reclamation's only research and demonstration pilot-scale facility specializing in the advancement of water treatment and desalination technology; and other related WQIC and YDP requirements.  The WQIC is a designated National Center for Water Treatment Technology, a nation-wide affiliation of publicly-funded water-research facilities that partner with the public for testing. The National Water Research Institute, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Army sponsor the National Centers Program. The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry. There are currently only seven National Centers in the U.S., and each center explores different water research focus areas.  The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting.  The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. The successful contractor shall provide all contract management, planning, supervision, administration, personnel, operation, engineering support, labor, tools, equipment, supplies, materials, chemicals, services, transportation, and facilities necessary to perform service in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).   The selected contractor must exhibit extensive advance water treatment research experience specializing in reverse osmosis (RO) desalting technology as specified in the SOW areas:  (1) Administration; (2) Operations; (3) Maintenance; and (4) Engineering support. The proposed contract is a fixed price level of effort incentive type contract.  The performance period will have a base (1 year) and 4 one year options.  The Government is responsible for determining the contractor's level of effort (LOE) for each contract year.  The Government, at its option and with notice, may increase or decrease the level of effort to achieve a desired level of support in accordance with the SOW.   This solicitation is a Two-Step Competitive Procedure:  (1) Step one - offerors will be invited to submit a technical proposal in accordance with Section M.  The Government will determine which firms are technically acceptable (down-selecting to all technically acceptable contractors).  The planned evaluation criteria are as follows: corporate experience, past performance, management and technical approach, staffing requirements, transition approach, subcontractors (small business).  Firms determined technically acceptable will be provided the opportunity to compete in Step two (cost).  (2) Step two - offerors will be invited to submit a fixed price proposal in accordance with Section M.   A fixed price labor rate award with an incentive (up to 6%) will be made to the firm that has been rated technically acceptable and offers the lowest acceptable price.   Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov.  This solicitation is a full and open competition solicitation.  The NACS code is 561210 (Facility Support Services).  The solicitation will be available on or about April 15, 2003.  Requests for the solicitation must be in writing and should be directed to the Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, Attn:  Jeff Palachat, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ 85364.  A fax request will be accepted at the following number 928-343-8568.   Requestors must provide a physical mailing address, fax number, e-mail address and telephone number.  All responsible sources may compete and be considered by the agency.  There is no charge for the first copy; additional copies are available at $25.00 per copy, non-refundable.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) to Repair and Modernize HVAC Building 8100 Complex.   The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide the labor, equipment and materials to refurbish HVAC Systems within Building 8100.  This work consists of replacement and upgrade Air Handling Units (AHUs), along with associated ductwork, instrumentation and controls, piping, insulation and wiring.	 This work also includes ASBESTOS abatement and painting within equipment rooms.  The AHUs are predominantly central station type with Chilled Water and Hot Water cooling and heating.      This work requires careful planning, scheduling and coordination in order to minimize impact to site activities.	All work will be accomplished in occupied and operating facilities.  Temporary heating/cooling must be provided.      Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.       The order of magnitude for this procurement is $500,000 and $1,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (365) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.	    This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238220 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.	  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about Mar 4, 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about Apr 3, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.	 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".	 Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office:  Anita.DeMarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.	 The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet at NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page:  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64	   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Government-wide Notes  NASA-Specific Notes

<DESC>As in many former communist countries in transition, Mongolia is struggling with the enormous challenge of improving performance across a range of areas necessary to expand growth rates, e.g., anti-corruption, tax reform, macro-economic policy, small business development, commercial law, law enforcement, competition and trade policy, enterprise privatization and restructuring, banking reform, and land use administration.  While the Government has made significant progress in advancing the reform agenda, such progress tends to reflect only the very early stages of reform.  Not only do these advances remain fragile and subject to backtracking, but there is a continuing need for providing the Government with high quality and timely analytical and policy formulation expertise in order to deepen the reform process.  USAID/Mongolia intends to implement the Economic Policy Reform and Competitiveness (EPRC), a 5-year program that will support policy changes that cause sustainable economic growth and increase economic resiliency.  Its activities will influence Mongolian competitive structure in ways that increase economic efficiency, increase investment opportunities, improve inter- and intra-sector trade efficiency and business efficiency.  EPRC activities may address any issue at any appropriate level that is seen to be impeding growth.  USAID anticipates awarding a cost reimbursable plus fixed fee contract (CPFF) for the 5-year EPRC program, which may be extended up to 3 years.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP that will be available on FedBizOpps on or about February 25, 2003.

The objective of this procurement is to find a computer test administrator that can provide a computer-based testing system, a network of testing centers located in all 50 states, and the resources and personnel needed to administer the examinations.   The USPTO anticipates the period of performance of this acquisition to be for a one-year base period, and four, one-year option periods.  The contract will be at no cost to the Government.

The reconfiguration services include disassembling the systems furniture, physical relocation to a new site, and reconfiguring it per the approved layouts. Warehousing space for the receipt and dispersal of systems furniture parts and pieces are also requested for the reconfiguration. The period of performance is anticipated from March 2003 through May 2005.  This acquisition is a 100% total small business set-aside.

<SUBJECT>B--Review of Existing and Emerging Environmentally-Friendly Offshore Dredging Technologies
<SOLNBR>71516
<RESPDATE>031003
<ARCHDATE>02112004
<CONTACT>Anna M. Brown Contract Specialist 7037871369     Anna.Brown@mms.gov;
<DESC>The United States (U.S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.  Since enactment of PL 103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. The process involved in the removal of seabed material and subsequent transport and placement of material on the beach or coastal area is called dredging. Offshore sand dredging for beach nourishment projects employ hydraulic dredges almost exclusively and are normally either cutterhead or hopper-type dredges.  Together with other factors (including practicality and costs), the distance from borrow site to beach determines the dredging and sand transport method to be used. Regardless of the dredging method employed, the process may result in adverse effects on various components of the marine or coastal environment.  The offshore dredging industry is constantly changing as the industry strives to make operations more efficient and more environmentally sensitive in order to reduce or eliminate potential adverse effects on the marine biological and physical regimes.  Many of these new engineering technologies are currently being used overseas and are being contemplated for use in U.S. waters. As the Federal agency responsible for regulation of OCS sand resources, the MMS must ensure that sand and gravel dredging operations conducted under its jurisdiction are being conducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  This may, in some instances, entail the required use of certain dredging equipment or techniques.  MMS must have intimate working knowledge of the most current dredging technologies available for use. SCOPE OF WORK: The objective of the study is to review and analyze dredging equipment and projects on a world-wide basis to identify existing and emerging dredging technologies that aim to lessen or avoid potential adverse effects on the offshore biological and physical environment. The Contractor will be required to: conduct a world-wide search of the existing literature base relative to completed and ongoing offshore dredging projects in order to identify new or emerging environmentally-friendly dredging technologies, review  the dredging industry's existing equipment and plans for manufacturing new dredging equipment in order to provide MMS with information relative to environmentally-friendly dredging options, conduct a technical examination and analysis of the various engineering/equipment options and their applicability for use in operations under MMS purview relative to the MMS Sand and Gravel Program. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be twenty (20) months with a cost range of $175,000 to $200,000. A scientific paper for publication in a refereed journal, as well as presentation of the study results at a scientific or technical conference are required. In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM, Monday, March 10, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:(A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years. REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED. Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and four (4) copies to Anna Brown , Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817. Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia. Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: (A) Experience and expertise of all technical Key Personnel. Particularly relevant is their expertise in the field of dredging technology and engineering or other relevant necessary disciplines to undertake the project, their experience in the type of work proposed, and demonstrated ability to do the work. Scientific personnel must collectively demonstrate relevant experience in the appropriate disciplines. This experience must be demonstrated through authorship in peer reviewed publications. Assessment factors will be their qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; the technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts will also be evaluated. Evaluation factors include 1. The length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks, 2. The level and quality of formal education in the disciplines and technical fields necessary, examining the level of relevant education attained as well as, honors, awards, and recognition of previous work. 3. Experience with similar programs and studies. (B) The Project Manager shall have: (1) experience and demonstrated leadership ability required for the coordination of the study process, (2) experience in managing a multi-disciplinary team and the interdisciplinary processes required for this study, and (3) ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule; and (C)Your organization's history of (1) successful completion of similar projects (similar in size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value), (2) producing high-quality documents, and (3) conducting similar projects on schedule and within budget. Questions should be faxed to Anna Brown at (703) 787-1022 or e-mailed to anna.brown@mms.gov. All correspondence should include the RFP number (71516), your full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers. Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for the manufacture, test, and delivery of (1) thirty 0.3 Second Time Delays and (2) fifty Side Hatch Thruster (Jettison) Cartridges.   (1) The 0.3 Second Time Delay is a part of the Overhead Window Crew Escape System, which is used in the event of a ground emergency requiring crew escape through the overhead window.  The time delay is installed in the pyrotechnic chain between the t-handle and the inner window.  The time delay allows the outer overhead window to be released prior to releasing the inner window.   (2) The Side Hatch Thruster (Jettison) Cartridges are part of the side hatch jettison system that is to be used in the event of an Orbiter bail out or emergency ground evacuation after landing.  Part of the system consists of 3 thrusters, which each have 2 pressure cartridges, that send the 310 pound hatch assembly out at 35 MPH within an 8" stroke. Producing and delivering the above items requires a vendor to go through qualification testing, which requires numerous tests, and a time frame of at least two years to complete.  This qualification requires a vendor to generate hardware, generate tooling drawings, and maintain baseline configuration control of all drawings.  In addition, the vendor would be required to generate assembly procedures, which are necessary to safely assemble the 0.3 second time delay units and the hatch jettison cartridges in accordance with state and federal regulations.  Next, the vendor would be required to generate acceptance test procedures to facilitate acceptance of each lot.  Finally, the vendor would be required to perform qualification testing in accordance with NSTS 08060.  This testing involves the following tests as a minimum, thermal cycling, vibration, pressure cycling, margin demonstration, auto ignition, and an eight-foot drop test.	 NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the qualified vendor, Goodrich Corporation, Universal Propulsion Company (UPCO).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as contemplated by the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time (CST) on March 4, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d) 	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].

<DESC>NA The fifteen month modification to FFP/CPFF Contract Number DAAB07-02-C-P304 is for enhancements to the Network Environment for Command, Control and Communications Mobile Systems (NECMS)/Mobility Assessment Test and Integration Center (MATIC), testing of Co mmand, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) Systems and testing support services.  The additional two one year options are included to enable additional facility enhancements, testing and testing support services. The NECMS/MATIC is a testing facility that is located on the Laguna Pueblo, that enables testing of C4 Systems in an unique environment that is virtually free of Radio Frequency (RF)interference.  It is critical that the government have immediate access to  testing facilities that provide the capability to enable rapid assessments of the operational capabilities, and interoperability of C4 systems.  The NECMS/MATIC is connected to an existing CECOM laboratory via fiber optic lines.  The connection of CECOM's  laboratory and the NECMS/MATIC requires expansion to enable comprehensive testing of C4 systems.  Additionally, continued testing and testing support services are required to meet the government's requirements.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to negotiate a sole source Purchase Order with XYZs of GPS to test the analysis portion of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System Test and Analysis (NDGPS) Modernization Program.  The testing will include the effectiveness of broadcasting centimeter level corrections.  As part of the GPS program, multiple GPS reference station receivers will be used and the data collected will generate and be configured for the most efficient broadcast.  The data will fit within the data stream, which is provided for the modulator for broadcast over the medium frequency data link.  Additionally, the modulator interface software will be developed by GPS to support the interfacing data compression software with the modulator.  The XYZs of GPS provides a unique combination of skills and technology that will meet the FHWA requirement for the program.  The skills involve the ability as well as the capability to rapidly reconfigure the data output of a GPS receiver through existing PC based data formatting algorithms, and apply it to the new modulator.  The XYZs of GPS has the expertise and full capability to support the data collection and analysis, which cannot be collected with any other organization.  Because the XYZs of GPS has the technology, expertise, as well as using their equipment to process the data that will be used in the NDPGS Modernization program, the data collected for the analysis cannot be combined from other sources they are the only known source that can provide the services required.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is February 25, 2003.

<CONTACT>Robert Toombs, Contracting Officer, 781-377-3989
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 28 February 2003, the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Integration Systems Program Office, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts anticipates the release of Request for Proposal (RFP) F19628-03-R-0001 for the acquisition of the United States Air Force (USAF) Advanced Remote Ground Unattended Sensor (ARGUS) System and, if option is exercised, United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advanced Air-Delivered Sensor (AADS) System program.  The USAF ARGUS program is intended to address a critical Air Force requirement to detect, track, identify, and report ground vehicles considered to be Time Sensitive Targets (TSTs) to the Air Operations Center in near real time (NRT).  The deployed units will be self-contained communications, electronics, power and sensor packaged in a delivery store.  Additional required capabilities include remote monitoring, mission planning, and pre-deployment checkout.  Initial capability will include a single sensor set with optional follow-on block upgrades for additional sensor types developed through a spiral development process.  ARGUS will be modular to permit easy integration of these additional sensors as they are developed. ARGUS is anticipated to eventually be a family of sensors.  The USMC AADS program is intended to address a critical requirement to detect, identify, and report enemy activity in the named area of interest and will be included as a contract option.  The AADS program will consist of the design, development, integration, testing, production, prepared documentation, logistics support, and technical support required to deliver the AADS to USMC designated locations. Offerors will satisfy ARGUS requirements as core capability, then comply with AADS requirements as an add-on capability.  The ARGUS and AADS Systems acquisition will each be conducted in two phases: ARGUS, Phase I, System Design and Development (SDD), estimated for FY03 to FY05; Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), estimated for FY04 to FY05; optional Spiral 1 Full Rate Production estimated for FY04 to FY05; and ARGUS Phase II, optional Full Rate Production and Sustainment, estimated for FY05 to FY09. AADS will consist of Phase I, optional System Design and Development (SDD), estimated for FY03 to FY05; optional Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) estimated for FY04 to FY05; and optional AADS Phase II, Full Rate Production and Sustainment, estimated for FY05 to FY09.  All work proposed under this effort, to include options, will be subject to cost evaluation. The contract's scope will include program risk management and reduction, system definition, system development integration, installation, test, fielding, delivery and support for the ARGUS and AADS systems.  The government intends to award one Cost-Plus-Award Fee/Firm-Fixed Price/ Time & Materials contract to a single prime contractor for both ARGUS and AADS systems.  Our acquisition approach is to award a single contract under Full and Open Competition utilizing FAR part 15 and Best Value Evaluation criteria.  Draft RFP documents are currently available on the Hanscom Air Force Base Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) Acquisition Website https://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp.  Offerors may view these documents by selecting the link "Advanced Remote Ground Unattended Sensors (ARGUS)". Offerors will be given 30 days to respond to the RFP solicitation upon its issuance.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, or HUBZone Small Business. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign owned firm.  Only U.S. Contractors will be considered for award.  Offerors will be required to have U.S. citizen staff personnel with Secret clearances and classified facility and storage capability in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5520.22-M by contract award.  Contractors who are interested in doing business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DOD Central Contracting Reporting System (CCR).   This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor a request for competitive proposals, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Please direct any questions on this NOCA to the following:  ESC/SRK  Attn: Robert Toombs, Contracting Officer  29 Randolph Road  Building 1102C, Room 249B  Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1634  robert.toombs@hanscom.af.mil  ESC/SRK  Attn: Stanley A.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE:  Proposal Submission Place:  Afghan Ministry of Communications, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Telecommunications Backbone Program - Afghanistan.  :  The Ministry of Communications of Afghanistan (MoC) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for a Telecommunications Backbone Program for the country of Afghanistan.

Afghanistan has recognized the importance of telecommunications to achieving the nation?s development and reconstruction goals.  An effective communications infrastructure would help stimulate economic growth, raise living standards and restore a sense of community and common purpose to the Afghan people.  A modern communications network would play a vital role in narrowing the physical distances that separate villages and towns and dramatically improve access to government services, educational opportunities and humanitarian relief efforts.  Moreover, modern communications support and enable all other sectors upon which the reconstruction efforts depend.  

Today Afghanistan has one of the weakest telecommunications systems in the world.  Statistically, only one out of every 625 Afghans has access to telephone service, yielding a ?teledensity? of 0.16 telephone lines for every 100 people.  This level is far below the developing country average of 2.6 lines per 100, and well below the World Bank?s targets for effectively stimulating economic growth.  All telephone users are concentrated in the main cities of Kabul, Herat, Mazar e Sharif, Jalalabad and Kandahar.  Practically speaking, telephone service is effectively non-existent in most areas of the country.  There is no functioning terrestrial telecom network and communications between provinces is restricted to limited satellite services.  Internet and data services have only recently begun in Kabul.  Government operations and the management of civil affairs are hampered by the absence of reliable communications services.  After 23 years of conflict and stalled investment, the entire sector needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

A critical project for restoring the productive capacity of the telecom sector is to establish a national high-speed backbone network utilizing funding from the international donor community.  The MoC proposes to build a 3300km backbone ring linking many of the principal cities of Afghanistan.  These include Kabul, Maidansher, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat, Qala e Naw, Maimana, Shiberghan, Mazar e Sharif, Aibak, Polikhomree and Charikar.  Additionally, the backbone will provide connectivity to international cable facilities:  from Herat to Iran and Turkmenistan; from Kandahar to Pakistan; from Mazar-e-Sharif to Uzbekistan; and from Kunduz to Tajikistan.  It is envisioned that, wherever possible, the fiber route will parallel the national roadway network that is also currently being reconstructed. Due to the mountainous terrain of the countryside, an estimated 85% of the route will be covered by buried fiber optic cable and the remaining 15% will be high-speed microwave.


The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $280,081 grant to the MoC from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  The Grant Agreement is expected to be signed soon.
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Ministry of Communications of Afghanistan c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. March 5, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  MoC reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  MoC also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  MoC is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD, has a requirement for the performance of the teardown and inspection of the port wing of the United States Navy (USN) P-3C Structural Life Assessment Program (SLAP) Full-Scale Fatigue Test (FSFT) test article to obtain data required for the re-baselining effort in the USN P-3C SLAP.  Participants in the program include the USN, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the Canadian Forces (CF), and the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN).  The RNLN has been a participant in the USN P-3C SLAP since its inception in 1998.  As a participant, the RNLN is obligated to provide technical/engineering contribution as well as funding to the program.  Under the USN P-3 SLAP, the RNLN is responsible for the teardown and inspection of the port wing of the USN P-3 SLAP FSFT test article in order to maintain structural data for the re-baselining effort for the USN P-3 airframe.  This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with the Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium (NLR), National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, Voorsterweg 31, 8316 PR Marknesse, The Netherlands, on an other-than full and open competitive basis.  The government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NLR to perform teardown and inspection of the port wing of the USN P-3 SLAP FSFT test article to fulfill the requirements of the USN P-3 SLAP.

The scope of work for this teardown and inspection effort includes a) build tools to support the subject wing sections, b) visually inspect the wing sections and document structural deficiencies, c) remove paint and sealant, d) completely dismantle the wing sections and document structural deficiencies, e) strip sealant, f) inspect parts with florescent penetrant, g) inspect selected holes with eddy current, h) cut coupons for fractography analysis, i) perform in-house Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis on the coupons, j) preserve and store the components for transporting them to a NAVAIR facility at the later date, and k) produce the final report documenting the results.
  
The proposed action will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with an estimated value of $800,000.00.  In order to meet the USN and FMS Case #NE-P-GJC requirements, contract award must be made approximately by 28 March 2003 and the period of performance will be approximately 12 months.  All work will be accomplished at the contractor?s site.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document is available.

Drawings/specifications will be available through the DIBBS or Srweb solicitation link in the synopsis on the solicitation issue date.  Proposed procurement contains a 100% option for increased quantities.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Approved source is: Sikorsky Aircraft Corp (78286).  It is anticipated that award will be made via a delivery order to an existing basic ordering agreement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The following are questions and answers for NAMA-03-Q-0008, 
Events Planner.

*** THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED PRIOR TO AWARD OF THIS SOLICITATION.***

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL COMBINED SYNOPSIS?SOLICITAION.  THE CLOSING DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED

1. Will you accept the proposal by Email?
     
Answer: Yes, we will accept proposals by email.  However, please contact Santo Plater by phone after you send your proposal to ensure that she has received it.

2. Should we figure Other Direct Costs, ie sound, lighting, staging, security, transportation, etc into the proposal?  

Answer: It is not necessary to include other direct costs.  As the Events Planner, you will be responsible for making contact with the responsible agencies that will provide these requirements such as security, transportation etc.  In the event it can?t be provided for through local and Gov?t agencies, the Events Planner will be then do market research and provide three sources to NARA who in turn will contract out for these services.

3. Is there an incumbent events planner contractor with NARA who will be considered for this project? 

Answer: The Foundation for the National Archives, a public/private partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration, has contracted with an events planner to oversee the Foundation-related events surrounding the reopening of the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom.  They are eligible to compete for this award also. 


4. The RFQ mentions working with the "...current Foundation-contracted
events planner and public relations firm..." Who is the current the
current firm? What is the contact's name and number?

Answer:   The public relations firm that the Foundation has contracted with is Susan Davis International the Events Planner that the Foundation has acquired is Peachey and Associates.  The Events Planner that gets this award will be required to work closely with these two companies.

5. When is the anticipated award date?
    
Answer: The anticipated award date is March 1, 2003
 
6. Is there a possibility of multiple awards to small businesses?
   
Answer: NARA anticipates making a single award for this requirement.

7. What constitutes as similar work / similar magnitude?

Answer:   a. Have you performed as an Events Planner in the past and if so was it on this scale, (involving as many activities, coordination efforts, high profile officials, etc...) 
b.  By magnitude we refer to dollar value. For example if you performed as an Events Planner where the dollar threshold was $25,000.00 and this project was for $100,000, that would not be the same magnitude of work.  There would be a lot more involved in a $100,000.00 project versus a $25,000.00 project. If you have performed as an Event s Planner on a $500,000.00 dollar project, it would safe to say that you could successfully accomplish this project.  

8. If the Offerors has not have any similar work/similar magnitude experience but does have years in event planning experience and can show in the RFQ that the Offerors can successfully do the work, will their RQF still be even consideration? 

Answer:  Based on the events that you have SUCCESSFULLY coordinated, and the magnitude of those efforts, we would determine if they would be considered relevant. 

9. Are there any cost that the government will be responsible for and should not be included in the Offerors bid, i.e., Insurance, liability? If so what are they?

Answer:  Any subcontract costs will be borne by NARA (see #11).

10. How many inquires/bidder for this RFQ ?

Answer: There is no way to anticipate how many quotes will be received for this effort.  We will know that at 3:30 on February 14, 03. 

11. Can the Event Planner have a partnering Events company or subcontract work out?

Answer.  Each agency can devise their quote any way the see fit to make the end result a success.  If you would like to hire someone/persons to assist in your effort that should be incorporated into your total fixed price amount. Your strategy of how to make this event successful, to include any work that you feel should be subcontracted out, will be taken into consideration as part of the evaluation for award. 

12. What is the turn around time when we will heard back if our RFQ is being considered?

Answer: We plan to make award no later than March 1, 03 and all unsuccessful bidders will be notified on or around that date. 

13. Do you want the brochures and or literature of our business?

Answer:  Any additional information that you can provide to better reflect your company?s credentials/abilities is appreciated. The most important information will be your past performance and your anticipated method of  performance for this project. 

14.  Will W.U. choose the P.R. firm? 

Answer:  No as stated in paragraph 4 above, The Foundation has a PR firm and NARA has Public Affairs personnel.  The Events Planner will work closely with these individuals.  

15. Will W.U. solicit the volunteers?
 
Answer: Yes, the Events Planner will be responsible for attaining volunteers where ever feasible.  

16. Do we provide the horses and horseman?
 
Answer:   The events planner will attempt to get volunteers, if this must be subcontracted out, the events planner will do the market research to get three sources and provide that information to NARA.  NARA will in turn issue a separate purchase for that service provided. 

17. Will there be any type of food provided, if so do we provide it?

Answer: The events planner will not be responsible for any food provided at any of the stated events. Just the coordination of the events.

18.  I was wondering how I could get more information regarding the request for proposals for the above event? Including how we might bid on such a project. I appreciate your response. 

Answer:  You would have to be more specific and state what additional information you are interested in.  Hopefully the attached questions will provide you with the additional information you need.


19.   Does the offeror need to include any Reps and Certs besides 52.212-3 and 52.212-5 in the proposal?

Answer:  To bid, simply forward your proposal based on the provided statement of requirements.  You will need to complete ALL areas of the Representations and Certifications.

 
20. a. Under the details section, September 17 reopening ceremony: At the
bottom, for the items in brackets: to what does the etc. refer?

Answer:  NARA has provided a basic agenda for what we envision to be a successful sequence of events surrounding the reopening of the Archives I.  What we are looking for from the successful awardee is the creativity to embellish on what we have provided to turn this event into something spectacular and memorable for all.  The etc? is what we are wanting the Events Planner to come up with.  
 
        b.  And, are they not asking for services with regard to preparing the invitation for
mailing, or any services in connection with the set up of the event itself? 

Answer:  We need the Events Planner to comprise the overall ?big picture? of  events that will transpire.  The specifics will be worked in more detail at a later date.   The invitations and things of that nature will/have already been handled by NARA and the Foundation.    

21.  Under the details section, September 18 thru 21st: At the bottom,
for the items in brackets: please clarify the meaning of coordinate media
coverage---does this mean the selected firm handles it entirely? Or does
the selected firm work with an in house media person?

Answer:  The events planner will work with in house and contracted media to coordinate media stops and coverage.
 
22. And to clarify the budget attachments required:

Answer:  Provide your total firm fixed price for this requirement.  ( A detailed breakdown of your cost is not required.)

23. Does the proposal require only the budgets for those components that the
contracted firm would be working on? For example, under September 17, there
are a lot of other costs connected with such a ceremony, but the proposal is
not asking for participation in those components. 

Answer:  While the ceremony is basically straightforward, the events planner should factor in any costs they think would be incurred to conduct a ceremony in the Rotunda.


24. In terms of the budget, are you asking for us to 
submit our budget for what it will cost to execute the event and/or or budget 
to execute the event alone. If so, is this inclusive of our costs?

Answer:  As stated in item #22 above, you are only required to submit a total lump sum price. 


25. How many pages should this RFQ be. Is there a limitation?

Answer: There is no limit to the number of pages submitted, however, please keep in mind that this is a simplified acquisition.

26. We are interested in responding to this request for proposal. What is due by what date? Is the complete proposal due on the 14th?
Answer:   February 14, 03 at 3:30 is the closing date for all submitted quotes to include a complete proposal.

27. PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The performance period referenced in the RFQ is for 90 days of planning between March 01 and October 15, 2003. Will your staff execute all the scheduled events during September or does the RFQ need to include planner fees for those three weeks as well? 

Answer: The Events Planner will be responsible for the planning and execution of all scheduled events and therefore should be reflected in your total bid price.  

28. COSTS: The RFQ calls for budgeting all costs. Does this mean I am expected to budget now for things such as: the actual copies of the Charters of Freedom, audio/visual (including lighting and video wall needs), generator power for all outdoor activities, travel accommodations for all of the 15 governors being invited, printing and mailing of all invitations, volunteers to provide tours of the Rotunda, public relations support referenced as "Media Coordination," and any other activities, suppliers or vendors that "I" foresee might be required? 

Answer: We need costs for a general look and feel of the day. Don't need to include invitations, volunteer tours of Rotunda, but if a video wall is needed, that would be included as overall look and feel of the day. 

29. SPONSORSHIPS: What percentage of the entire costs are you expecting to be realized through corporate or in-kind sponsorships? What benefits can be offered to partners? Are there any events that sponsors are not allowed to be represented at or included in? Will the sponsorships dollars be paid directly to the NARA Foundation, or will the planner use these monies to fund all scheduled activities? Is the planner responsible for producing the collateral materials needed for solicitation? 

Answer: Although we would like all of our costs covered, we expect only a small percentage of costs will be borne by partnerships. Money received would probably be deposited with our Foundation. 

30. PAYMENTS: Can you please clarify "Milestone Payments?" I couldn't find a reference to this language in Sec. 32 of the FAR. 

Answer:  NARA will authorize partial payments based on actual costs incurred/effort.  The specifics of these payments (i.e. frequency, amounts,) will be worked out after award. 

31.  CONTRACT LINE ITEM #: CLIN 0001. Where can I find information on what this means? 
SECURITY: There is no mention of security needs for any activities. Will the planner be responsible for planning and budgeting this cost? 

Answer: CLIN 0001 refers to the line item number for this project and there is only one, which is the Events Planner. The Events Planner will not be responsible for security.  

32.  MEDICAL/EMT SERVICES: Again, there is no mention of these services in the RFQ. 
Shall I budget for these costs now? 

Answer: No, however if these services will be needed, you should list them (but not necessarily include costs.) 

33. STREET CLOSINGS: For the actual week of the unveiling and tours at the NARA, do you anticipate activities to occur along the street such as within a mini fair/festival? 

Answer: Probably not, however we anticipate participating in a festival on the Pennsylvania side of our building for the weekend of September 20-22, 03, but should not require street closures. 

34. PAST PERFORMANCE REPORTS: I have been planning events for 15 years and opened my own small business in March of last year. In addition to the events I produced since last year, would you accept past performance reports from events I produced while being an employee of a company? I could supply letters of reference, etc. 

Answer: Yes, whether you worked independently or for an agency all past performance is welcomed to establish your abilities

<DESC>This modification is made to the notice issued earlier today to acquire the services of two contract specialists.  
1)  Self-employed individuals with the requisite experience are encouraged to respond to this RFQ.
2)  Self-employed individuals responding to this RFQ must reside within the Washington, D.C. commuting area.  Any offered employees of companies or corporations must reside within the Washington, D.C. commuting area,and companies or corporations outside of the Washington, D.C. commuting area must demonstrate in their proposal that they can manage such individuals.
3)  The BEP may make award to a single company or corporation for the services of two individuals, or two awards to two companies or corporations for the services of two individuals (one individual to each company or corporation), or two awards to two self employed individuals, or an award to one company or corporation for one individual and another award to a self-employed individual.  This is due to BEP's perception of the relative scarcity of highly-qualified personnel.  There is no incumbent contractor.
4)  BEP's contract specialist will be available for questions up to Thursday, December 19th.  Every effort will be made to respond to questions submitted by e-mail as of 12/19.  All others will be answered prior to the RFQ due date; however, no additional responses can be made until after the return to duty of the contract specialist on January 6, 2003.  Therefore, potential offerors should proceed based on information as contained in the basic RFQ notice and attached files published in the Federal Business Opportunities, as amended by this notice.  E-mails may be sent to george.robertson@bep.treas.gov.  There are no other changes to this RFQ as originally published.

More than 400,000 individuals in the U.S. die each year from tobacco-related diseases and many U.S. populations suffer disproportionately from these diseases.  The publication of the recommendations and articles that address specific disparate populations is the second step toward translating presentations and data from the meeting into publishable results.  The results will be used by funding organizations, institutes, communities, and other stakeholders to help the nation achieve its goals to eliminate disparities and reduce tobacco use in the United States.  The publication of these documents will address tobacco use disparities in the areas of basic biology, capacity and infrastructure, community and state, epidemiology, marketing, policy, prevention of tobacco use, psycho social research, surveillance, harm reduction, and treatement of nicotine addition.  The populations studied within these domains are defined by race/ethnicity, education, gender, age, income, social class, disability, geographic location, sexual orientation, religion, occupation, mental illness and institutionalization.  The American Public Health Association is the oldest and largest organization of public health professionals, it has more than 50,000 members from more than 50 occupations in public health, which will enable NCI to reach a broad audience of researchers and practitioners.  The American Journal of Public Health is the only journal known to the government that can provide the above services. This is not a request for compeitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to make award, on a sole source basis, to Proteus Research and Consulting, Ltd. (PRC)  Due to an interest in declines in amphibians, a large-scale monitoring and research program is to be conducted.  The monitoring plan incorporates three levels of sampling and estimation.  The intermediate level of sampling and inference will use detection/non-detection data collected during repeat visits to sample units in order to estimate the proportion of sample units occupied by species of interest.   The general objective of the proposed work is to explore study design options with the ultimate goal of determining designs that are optimal for specified purposes.  Vendor will supply equations, computer software, figures or tables permitting user/reader to determine the appropriate sampling designs for specified objectives.  A final report including components will be ready to submit to major ecological journals.  PRC is considered to be the sole source for this work because the director of the company was the lead researcher in developing the closed models used in occupancy estimation.  This work led to the initial scientific publication on the method and a manuscript on assessing fit of models.  PRC is the only know vendor with staff with required statistical knowledge, programming ability and experience with the models needed to perform these services within one year.   This award will be made on or about February 19, 2003, under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.00. The delivery date for services will be one year from date of award. The NAICS code for the acquisition is 541710.    THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. .  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within ten days of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (703) 648-7367 or e-mail mfritts@usgs.gov. A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS), 3400 Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro, Tennessee intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Medrad, Inc., 1 Medrad Drive, Indianola, PA for the purchase of a NeuroVascular Array GE Signa 1.5T; Medrad 9500 Multigas MRI Monitor; CAPNO kit; FI02 kit; and accessories.   The NAICS Number 339112 applies with a size standard of 500 employees.  TVHS believes this MRI monitor is the only one that has the combined features of fiber optic cables and short graphite leads which protects the patient from RF heating and eliminates potential for patient burns.  TVHS also believe this Neurovascular Array is the only one that allows for complete MR imaging of the brain, soft tissue neck, cervical and upper thoracic spine region without having to change patient onto another table and coil when doing both head and spine examinations, saving both time and patient discomfort of having to undergo going in and out of the tube multiple times.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, interested parties that believe they can meet these needs with an equal product must furnish sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements no later than 4:00pm, February 19, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>F-16 Radar Electro Optical (REO) IU/EU System Request for Information
This announcement constitutes a request for information.  The Air Force plans to use Falcon Flex Program procedures to replace the existing Radar Electro Optical (REO) Indicator Unit (IU) and Electronics Unit (EU) with a more reliable, longer life REO system that carries a ten-year warranty and has a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5,000 hours.  The Falcon Flex Program encourages the procurement of items using performance based acquisition specifications vice build-to-print requirements.  This procurement will be based on "best value" to the government, not necessarily lowest initial procurement cost.  The REO system will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function and interface equivalence.  As a design option, all of the electronics may be contained in the IU box, with the EU box serving as wiring pass through.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability REO system using modern technology rather than traditional build to print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for approximately 800 units.  The new REO system will replace the current REO IU (NSN 5841-01-096-3945, P/N 29200-99) and REO EU (NSN 5841-01-096-4833, P/N 29500-109).

Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the new REO system.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first flight article delivery are also solicited as aids in the budgeting process.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Written responses must be submitted by March 10, 2003 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN: Lorraine Vernon, 6072 Fir Ave, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5820.  No telephone or fax responses will be accepted.  A top-level drawing set describing the current REO IU and EU, the Statement of Objectives, the Performance Based Acquisition Specification, and the Test Plan are available upon request.  

For answers to technical questions regarding this effort, please contact Mr. Charles Williams at (801) 777-7393, e-mail charles.williams@hill.af.mil or Mr. Charles Reveal at  (801) 775-2623, e-mail charles.reveal@hill.af.mil.  For answers to contractual questions, or to obtain the top level drawing set of the current REO IU and EU and other documents, please contact Ms. Lorraine Vernon at (801) 777-0135, e-mail lorraine.vernon@hill.af.mil

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Heidi L Radaford, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7386
<DESC>Request for information for Government/Industry Standardization Forum for FORCEnet SOLICIATATION NUMBER: Description:  The purpose of this announcement is to solicit informatio= n from Industry on recommendations for the application of standards towar= d meeting the Navy?s FORCEnet objectives in the form of white papers and = with a possible follow up invitation to a Government/Industry Forum on stand= ards use for FORCEnet. I.    General Information The purpose of this announcement is to solicit participation (at no cos= t to the Government) in an USN/Industry forum on identifying technical stand= ards potentially applicable to a FORCEnet architecture.   This is not a requ= est for proposals.  FORCEnet enables the war fighter to obtain and process = data and information to achieve mission goals.   FORCEnet is the architectur= al framework for Naval Warfare in the information age which integrates war= fighters, sensors, networks, command and control, platforms and weapons= into a networked, distributed combat force, scalable across the spectru= m of conflict.  The Navy needs to develop a common standardization perspecti= ve that supports FORCEnet.    Sensors and combat and air systems informati= on infrastructure are part of the FORCEnet architecture and the requiremen= ts and standards associated with C4I systems also need to be considered. To implement the concepts of integrating the C4I infrastructure, which includes voice/video, data, radio frequency (RF) devices, sensors and related systems under the FORCEnet umbrella with the warfighters, netwo= rks, platforms and weapons, the standards to be used in all these different areas need to be listed and any deficiencies identified.  The purpose o= f this Government/Industry forum will be to identify those standards that=  may be necessary to promote compatibility at the earliest opportunity in th= e acquisition process for FORCEnet infrastructure.  In addition, since th= e operational concepts that would use the systems that implement FORCEnet= would evolve and adapt to changing requirements through time, it is anticipated that most systems will be spiral development efforts.  To k= eep pace with evolving requirements and technology, standards must keep pac= e as well.  This announcement is to solicit industry members to form a Navy (SYSCOM/PEO)/Industry joint forum to address relevant standards for FORCEnet II.   Requirements for White Papers A two-page white paper on what standards and how standards should be applied to FORCEnet. For example, what Government and commercial standa= rds should be used to implement a Navy battle group network?  For this particular scenario what standards need to be considered such that the system is interoperable, takes advantage of current technology, and can= grow to incorporate new technology?  The paper shall also identify your= expertise and experience in this area that would indicate your qualifications to be a significant contributor to the forum. III.  Submission of White Papers White paper submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  All interested responsible sources may submit a white paper. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Sm= all Business, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, and Service-Disabled Veteran Ow= ned Small business are encouraged to participate. Submissions are provided electronically to SPAWAR under the following instructions.  Submission will be either scanned ?TIFF? or ?PDF? docume= nts. Electronic copies shall be submitted via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central (SPAWAR E-CC).  Submitters shall register in the SPAWAR E-CC and select= their own password in order to provide a submission.  For information a= bout e-Proposal submits, please visit the SPAWAR E-CC.   The URL is https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Each electronic file shall be clearly marked to show solicitation numbe= r and submitters name.  Proposals shall contain no classified data. Potential submitters have until 17 February 2003 to submit their white papers for consideration. IV.   Evaluation Criteria White papers will be evaluated and selected attendees invited to the fo= rum based on the following: =B7     Familiarity with standards applicable to FORCEnet =B7     Knowledge of current technology =B7     Past experience with standards work both development of and implementation of standards V.    Notification This request is for information purposes and the government plans to us= e these white papers in an open industry and Government forum therefore t= he Government will exercise general-purpose rights for the white papers submitted.  The Government will provide no funding for direct reimburse= ment for preparation of the white papers, or if invited, will provide no reimbursement to attend the forum.  The Government will not return the submitted white papers.  The Government seeks wide participation but ma= y have to limit the number of participants to achieve an effective forum.= If, it is necessary to limit participation in the forum due to a large number of responses, attendance will be by invitation at the Government= ?s sole discretion and may consider both expertise and the desire for a ra= nge of participants.  Explanations for non-selection will not be provided. Notice of selection will be made about 21 February 2003 and the initial= meeting of the Forum will be at an east coast location on or about 7 Ma= rch 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- Tri-Service Study that will determine the current directed energy test and evaluation infrastructure requirements
<DESC>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE TO ANNOUNCE PLANS AND SOLICIT INFORMATION FOR THE CENTRAL TEST AND EVALUATION INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CTEIP) FUNDED TRI-SERVICE STUDY (T-SS) OF DIRECTED ENERGY TEST AND EVALUATION INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS - THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. The Air Force does not intend to award a contract or assistance instrument as a result of response(s) to this notice.  Information obtained from this and subsequent requests, however, will strongly influence the basis of future contract actions.  CTEIP is funding a Tri-Service Study (T-SS) that will determine the current directed energy (DE) test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure requirements, capabilities, shortfalls, and solutions.  The T-SS will produce roadmaps of recommended solutions to the current shortfalls. Directed Energy Test and Evaluation Capabilities (DETEC) is a proposal to CTEIP that will implement the infrastructure solutions contained in the T-SS roadmaps. DETEC is estimated at $48M for FY04-08. One purpose of this notice is to announce the T-SS and encourage parties in industry, academia and government with DE interest and expertise to participate in the solution development process.  HQ AFOTEC, Kirtland AFB, will host an industry day that will be open to all interested parties on 4 Feb 2003.  The industry day is an opportunity to meet the government management team and learn more about both DETEC and the T-SS.  The T-SS will solicit ideas for the development of solutions to specific shortfalls as they are discovered by the study.  This solicitation for ideas will be accomplished through a BAA to be issued in the July 2003 time period.  Responses to the BAA must be received within 30 days and will be in the form of white papers that detail the following: a description of each idea, how the idea responds to the identified shortfall, how each idea could be used or integrated on existing MRTFBs and/or facilities, what the mobility characteristics are, and schedule/cost estimates for construction of the solution.  Proposal ideas will not be shared or discussed outside the government and will be considered proprietary if the respondent so desires.  The government will be using a contractor to manage and perform bookkeeping on responses to these solution requests; the contractor will abide by an existing conflict of interest clause to ensure non-disclosure of any proprietary information.  The government will evaluate proposed solution ideas and select one or more of them to be placed in the T-SS roadmap.  Proposed solutions will be evaluated based on risk, maturity, cost, program need date, suggested location and also against other proposed solutions.  The government may also utilize federally funded research and development centers to help provide assessments and prioritization of solution ideas into the T-SS roadmap.  If a chosen solution idea has proprietary information, only non-proprietary information will be included in the T-SS roadmap.  Some shortfall requirements, and thus some solution proposals, may be classified at the SECRET level.  In order to receive classified shortfall requests, organizations must provide a POC along with a secure means of communication (classified fax, classified email, or classified mailing address) to the T-SS point of contact listed below.  DETEC will implement the T-SS roadmap in separate contracting efforts (whether by RFP or BAA) for some or all of the solutions contained in the T-SS roadmap beginning in FY04.  Competition for DETEC infrastructure projects will be open to all.  Offerors do not have to participate in the T-SS solution development process in order to submit a proposal to future solicitations that result from DETEC?s implementation of the T-SS roadmap.  Respondents who participate in this solution development process will not be given preference during the evaluation of proposals submitted under future DETEC contracting efforts.  Responses to this notice should be an RSVP to the T-SS industry day on 4 Feb 2003.  Organizations desiring to receive classified proposal requests should identify a POC and secure means of communication to the T-SS point of contact listed below.  The following schedule is anticipated: RSVP to T-SS industry day - NLT 27 Jan 03; POCs for classified shortfall requests provided from interested contractual parties - NLT 30 Jun 03; invitation to provide solution ideas for specific shortfalls - beginning 1 July 2003 but NLT 28 Aug 2003; due date for solution idea white papers- 28 Aug 2003; DETEC BAAs and RFPs - beginning in FY04.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  The NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program is interested in receiving abstracts and ultimately proposals (technical and cost) on the research effort described below. The ultimate program goal is to reduce U.S. shipbuilding cost and cycle time from initial business strategy development through post-delivery customer service. This mission includes efforts in shipbuilding and repair and supports the Navy's operational vision, Sea Power 21.  The mission also supports efforts to reduce total ownership costs and develop technologies and processes to support design and construction of new platforms (e.g., Littoral Combat Ship, DDX).  The complete Research Announcement (RA) is posted at www.nsrp.org. This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices across the following major initiative areas in U.S. shipyards: Shipyard Production Process Technologies; Business Process Technologies; Product Design and Material Technologies; Systems Technologies; Facilities and Tooling; and Crosscut Initiatives. These major initiatives are described in detail in the recently updated Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) located on the Web at www.nsrp.org. Offerors are strongly advised to read the SIP in order to gain a greater understanding of the sub-initiative areas for each major initiative. Because the program major initiatives are closely tied to each other, proposals may be submitted with a scope that represents integrated efforts across several major initiative and/or sub-initiative areas. Teaming: Teaming arrangements are encouraged. At least one U.S. shipyard should be substantially involved in each project, normally in a leadership role. Exceptions to this may be considered on a case-by-case basis where there is compelling justification that the program mission is best served by the proposed deviation.  Awards: Due to limited funding, the NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received. Awards will be made using a class of non-procurement instruments called Technology Investment Agreements (e.g., Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). These assistance instruments are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A copy of the NSRP ASE Program Technology Investment Agreement is available on the NSRP Web site (www.nsrp.org) under R&D Programs. For those proposals that are approved for award by the Executive Control Board (ECB), a letter contract will be executed immediately after the selection meeting.  This letter contract is expected to be for a period of 45 days with sufficient funding to conduct project kickoff activities. All proposers, unless exceptions are authorized by the ECB for unusual circumstances (e.g., significant changes to the SOW directed by NSRP), will be expected to sign the final agreement within 45 days of selection. The amount of funding available will be dependent upon receipt of Government Fiscal Year 2004 funds. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to terminate awards if the offeror is not able to conclude a formal, signed Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) within 45 calendar days of selection notification.  RA Process: This is an unrestricted solicitation.  Proposal Preparation and Submittal: 
Offerors should obtain a copy of the latest NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise Proposal Preparation Kit (currently version 4.3 - available from the NSRP ASE and NSRP Web site at www.nsrp.org).  This guide is specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the RA proposal process.  The proposal format provided in the PPK is mandatory.  A link for submitting questions regarding the proposal process will be provided at www.nsrp.org.  All questions received and corresponding answers will be posted to this site (publicly accessible). Abstracts for this research announcement are optional, but must be submitted in the format described in Attachment 4 of the PPK.  Abstracts for this solicitation are due no later than 3:00 PM Eastern time on 3 March 2003. Submit abstracts to NSRP ASE Program Administrator, Advanced Technology Institute, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, Attn: Ms. Melissa Henry, ATI Contracts Department.  Electronic submission of abstracts is encouraged and should be sent to henry@aticorp.org.  Feedback on the abstracts will be provided to submitters no later than 11 March 2003. Full Proposals (hard copy) in response to this Research Announcement (RA) shall be submitted by 1 May 2003, 12:00 PM Eastern Time, addressed to NSRP ASE Program Administrator, Advanced Technology Institute, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, Attn: Ms. Melissa Henry, ATI Contracts Department. Proposals received after the time and date specified will be returned to the proposer and will not be evaluated. Acknowledgement of receipt of proposals will be made after the due date.  REQUIREMENTS:  Technical Description: This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices in U.S. shipyards as described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). Additional areas of interest: While not a separate major initiative, of particular interest during this solicitation are initiatives directed toward implementing lean enterprise concepts.  Another area of interest during this solicitation is continuing, to multiple shipyard implementation, the effort begun by the NSRP-sponsored "World Class" U.S. Material Standards and Parametric Design Rules to Support Commercial and Naval Auxiliary Ship Construction project team.  Refer to the entire research announcement posted on the Web at www.nsrp.org for the detailed Technical Description.  Security Requirements: Classified material is not expected to be used on this effort. Other Special Requirements: Proposers are advised that research findings and technology developments arising under this Agreement may constitute a significant enhancement to the national defense, and to the economic vitality of the United States.  As such, in the conduct of all work under this agreement, the Recipient will comply strictly with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (22 CFR pt. 121 et seq.), the DoD Industrial Security Regulation (DoD 5220.22-R) and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation (15 CFR pt. 770 et seq.).
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Anticipated Period of Performance: The total length/duration of the technical effort is expected to vary by project complexity. It is anticipated that most projects will be 12 or less months in duration. It is recognized that complex projects may require technical efforts of longer periods; however, due to funding limitations, projects in excess of 18 months of funded effort may not be considered based on the uncertainty of funding in FY05 and beyond. The contractor may also provide for an additional 2 months for processing/completion of the final report. Offerors' proposals that are longer than 12 months, must define one-year (or less), sequential (non-overlapping) project phases to allow for go/no-go decisions between the phases. Updated Return on Investment evaluations, similar to those required for RA proposals will be required at the end of each phase.  Each phase should specify key tasks (activities) and deliverables (results). The offerer has the opportunity to include in the proposal follow-on options, each 12 months or less, that may be considered should funding become available. These options are in addition to the 12-18 month proposed base project activity.  The base proposal work must be able to stand on its own merits and not be dependent upon any options proposed. Expected Award Date: July 2003 for most, if not all, selected proposals. Funding Estimate: It is anticipated that approximately $7,000,000 - $8,000,000 over an 18-month period will be available for new NSRP ASE Program awards for this solicitation cycle based on expectations of congressional budget actions. Of the total anticipated funding, approximately $1,000,000 is expected to be available in GFY 2003, with the remaining funding commencing in November/December 2003.  There is no guarantee of this funding level or that awards will be made in any individual topic areas. Multiple awards may be made in a given area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and available funding. Potential funding levels for future years are described in the NSRP ASE Strategic Investment Plan available on the Web site.  Some program funding may be used to support other methods of industry technology advancement, such as symposia and industry study groups. Type of Funding Instrument: The contractual vehicle used to fund the awards will be a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA).   A copy of the TIA may be found on http://www.nsrp.org.  Proposals without an affirmative response to the cover page certification of agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of the Technology Investment Agreement  (current version is  dated February 10, 2003) will be subject to elimination during screening.  Proposers are advised to contact the ATI Director of Contracts if they have any questions on this requirement. Program Furnished Property: 
None contemplated. Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the NSRP ASE Program Office point of contact cited below upon deciding to respond to this announcement. Foreign contractors should be aware that prior Government approval may be required before their proposals can be considered.
PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  General Instructions: Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit (available at www.nsrp.org) to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals. Proposal questions should be directed (E-mail is preferred) to one of the point of contact listed elsewhere herein. Offerors should consider instructions contained in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit. Technical and cost proposals, submitted in separate volumes, are required and shall be valid for 180 days. The proposal format provided in the program Proposal Preparation Kit is mandatory.  Proposals shall reference the RA number (NSRP ASE 03-01).

Offerors are also encouraged to submit one copy of the cost and technical proposals via electronic means (using Microsoft software - Windows 95 or later versions) on computer disk or CD-ROM. The disks shall be virus free.  It is acceptable to provide graphics/exhibits in a separate hard copy or as part of the electronic file.  Providing an electronic copy of the proposal is voluntary and will not affect proposal evaluation.  All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered against the criteria set forth herein. Offerors are advised that only NSRP ASE Program Office contracting officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the program. Cost Proposal: The accompanying cost proposal/price breakdown shall be supplied together with supporting schedules. Copies of the above-referenced forms may be obtained by accessing the NSRP Web site.  Refer to the program Proposal Preparation Kit for additional details. Technical Proposal: The technical proposal shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the research, the technical approach and appropriate metrics to gage progress. Proposal formats as specified in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit are mandatory.  If the PPK requires a particular section, and the offeror determines that the section is not applicable to their proposal, the section shall be included and annotated as not applicable with a brief explanation as to why not applicable.  Proposals that develop technology that is readily transferable throughout the industry and for which there is an appropriate technology transfer plan will receive higher scores than those that produce less demonstrable, transferable results. Offerors must include an approach for implementing the proposed technology (if successful) throughout the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Proposals should discuss proposed demonstrations, pilots, and/or prototypes as well as any other technology transfer activities. Proposed project success criteria should be specified.  Resumes of personnel (limited to 2 pages each) who will be participating in this effort should also be included as an appendix to the technical proposal and are not included in the page limit.  The technical proposal shall include a Statement of Work (SOW) suitable for contract incorporation as an attachment detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort. Offerors must use the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit available on the Web (www.nsrp.org) to assist in SOW preparation. Any questions concerning the technical proposal or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Point of Contact cited in this announcement.  Crosscut Initiatives: All proposals shall also specifically address the crosscut initiative areas (technology transfer; organizational change; education and training; and human resources) - or identify why this is inappropriate for the specific proposal.  Proposers are encouraged to review the technology transfer guide available on the NSRP web site. Page Limitations: The technical proposal shall be limited to 40 pages (fixed pitch font of 12 or fewer characters per inch or proportional font point size 10 or larger), single-spaced, single-sided, 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8.5 by 11 inches). Smaller type may be used in figures and tables, but must be clearly legible.  Margins on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right) should be at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). The page limitation includes all information, except the Cover Page, Table of Contents, List of Figures and Tables, Cross Reference to Evaluation Criteria, Resumes, Statement of Work, Letters of Commitment, and Teaming Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement.  Pages in excess of this limitation will not be considered. Offerors are advised that the number of pages should be commensurate with the degree of complexity of the proposed effort.  It is expected, and encouraged, that less complex, less expensive proposals will be significantly less than 40 pages in length. Cost proposals have no page limitations, however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to less than 45 pages as a goal.  Preparation Cost: This announcement does not commit the program to pay for any response preparation cost. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered a direct charge to any resulting award or any other contract.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's response (both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. Details of the evaluation criteria are provided in the Proposal Preparation Kit, and are summarized below: Technical Aspects: The technical aspect, which is ranked as the first order of priority relative to the other factors (cost share, proprietary content, and cost aspect), shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
a. Strategic fit and leverage; b. Business case, including return on investment; c.  Innovation and technical merit; d. Technology transfer and industry implementation; and, e. Team strength and management plan. The first is the most important technical factor. Proposals that do not meet the strategic fit and leverage criteria will not be recommended for award.  The other four technical factors are of equal importance to each other.  Each is defined in greater detail in the Proposal Preparation Kit. Other Factors: a. Cost Share: The proposal shall demonstrate a commitment to share the cost and risk of the proposed effort. The NSRP ASE program goal is 50% cost share (i.e., for every dollar of program funding provided, industry will provide at least one (1) dollar of cost share). While there is no pre-determined cost share ratio requirement for any single project, the following incentives apply: (1) Shipyard-specific proposals are expected to provide significantly higher cost share than collaborative projects, and (2) All projects will compete on, among other factors, the degree to which the proposers will share the cost and thus leverage program funds.  Additional information regarding allowable types of cost share can be found in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit. b. Shipyard Specific Projects: Most of the program funding will be applied toward open, collaborative projects that are widely acceptable with broad applicability.  For this reason, most projects will be recommended for award on the basis of sharing results within the U.S. industry. It is anticipated that some projects with limited access, and limited or delayed applicability to the broad industry will be awarded, but these projects will require substantially higher cost share. The estimated fraction of a proposed project's funding that will be used in developing technologies that will be openly shared without delay, such that a higher percentage of the results are shared, will be considered in the evaluation.  Proposals with a higher degree of results that are openly shared and readily transferable throughout the industry will be viewed more favorably. Cost Aspects: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. 
POINT OF CONTACT: Questions related to this RA should be directed to the NSRP ASE Program Office, Advanced Technology Institute, Ms. Melissa Henry, North Charleston, SC 29418, (843) 760-3366, E-mail henry@aticorp.org.
