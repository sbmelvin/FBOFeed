The vendor shall provide the following: 1.) Results of Operational Tests with F-15 and F-16 units; 2.) Results of Ground Evaluations to verify the maintenance concept, fitting procedures, and in-cockpit pre-flight checks; 3.) Results of Flight Evaluations to verify operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness with the F-15 and F-16 airframes; 4.) Provide test data that demonstrates visual compatibility for in- and out-of-cockpit environments for the F-15 and F-16 airframes; 5.) Demonstrate production capability by providing a minimum of 120 production representative devices and present manufacturing data to verify production yields and confirm manufacturing capacity and maturity; 6.) Provide test data that demonstrates physical compatibility with the aircrew population for spectacle frame compatibility (form/fit/function) with the JHMCS ensemble; The device shall meet requirements contained in the ALEP Performance Specification which includes laser protection, optical qualities, visual performance, durability, and environmental specifications.<br />Current qualified source is: Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked. 
This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request For Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the responses to this market survey or activities contained herein.   Therefore, any costs associated with this submission are solely at the interested vendor's expense. The FAA is preparing to conduct a procurement for VHF radios, UHF radios, and VHF/UHF Emergency Transceivers (ETRs) as part of the NEXCOM Segment 2 Program.  To streamline our acquisition process, it is the FAA's intent to award the VHF and UHF radios contract to a single vendor at this time.   The contract for the VHF/UHF ETR may or may not be awarded to the VHF and UHF radios contract vendor.  The purpose of this market survey is to gain knowledge of interested vendors who can provide and demonstrate their VHF, UHF, and/or VHF/UHF ETR products.  It also solicits statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors for this acquisition.   Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists for a single contract vendor who can provide both VHF and UHF radios.  The expected release date for the Screening Information Request (SIR) is October, 2009.  The FAA is estimating that approximately 33,000 VHF and UHF radios will be purchased.  Approximately 1,550 VHF/UHF emergency transceivers will be purchased.  Expected contract duration is 10 years (5 years base contract; 5 - one year options).  Leading up to the SIR release, the FAA may release multiple Requests For Information (RFIs) to gauge the availability of product features and to solicit comments from industry.   
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
1.   Identify organization's business classification      (a)  whether your company is a large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned or small service-disabled veteran-owned business;      (b)  GSA Schedule Contract Number if the company is a GSA Schedule Holder   2.   Product availability (in-house, teaming, etc.) 
3.   Name of teaming partners with a description of each partner's product. 
4.	Product Specifications.5.	Interest in having a product demonstration at the William J Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ should be provided with the response.  A minimum 3 week notification is required. Coordination requests can begin immediately.  No product demonstrations will be conducted after May 31, 2009.  
All responses (one response per company) must be provided on company letterhead. No font type less than 12 point may be used. Responses must be received no later than 2 PM local time on February 20, 2009.   
The FAA prefers all submittals to be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address:
Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov and  cc: Emily.Kingston@faa.gov.  Please submit as a MS Word, Excel or PDF file. If you are unable to submit electronically, please send at least two hard copies by the indicated deadline to:

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0003.  The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4.  The Government will also determine the realism and bala! nce of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Vendor past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance:  1.

Management - the expected performance in managing the subje! ct availability based upon an vendor's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions.  This includes an evaluation of the vendor's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance.  The Government may use other sources, as appropriate.  The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance.  However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government ! will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ.  However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2).  The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years.  On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance.  However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contr! actor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts.  Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts.  Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us.  Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want.  Vendors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.

<a href="mailto:BRITZ.HELEN@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541618   The objective of this SOW is to contract a third party to perform a formal risk assessment of the EPA Acquisition System (EAS) and the General Support System (GSS) as appropriate.  Risk assessments by independent, external third parties are required for major applicationsand general support systems owned and/or operated by, or on behalf of, Federal agencies at least every three years or when a major change occurs.  EAS is a new application replacing the legacy systems Integrated Contract Management System (ICMS) and Small Purchase Electronic Data Interchange (SPEDI).  It is a COTs package with some configurability and for which a Work Assignment module is being written to EPA's specifications.  EAS requires a risk assessment as part of the pre-deployment activity leading to a Certification and Authorization to Operate (C&A).  In addition, the servers which support this system are being reconfigured as part of a GSS change; the assessment of risk for the GSS shall be an optional task to be undertaken when all the hardware is in place. 
System boundaries are defined to identify the limits of the risks to be assessed.  Infrastructure that is beyond the boundaries identified herein is outside the scope of this SOW.  OAM's physical system boundaries for the purposes of this SOW include all servers and peripherals over which OAM has control and that are connected to OAM's subnet of the EPA network in the Ronald Reagan Building, Washington, D.C.  Note that routers, switches and wiring connecting OAM's servers to all devices in OAM's sixth and seventh floor offices are maintained by the Office of Environmental Information and thus are outside the boundaries of the SOW.
As required by the Federal Information Security management Act (FISMA) of 2002, EPA follows standards and guidelines for information security developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  OAM has categorized the data maintained by EAS and stored on its GSS according to NIST's Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS PUB 199), Standard for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.  Through this process, OAM has determined that the data maintained and stored on its information systems require a moderate level of protection.
OAM is using NIST's Special Publication (SP 800-53), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, Annex 2, Baseline Security Controls for Moderate-Impact Information Systems, as guidance for development and implementation of security controls for EAS.  Attached to this SOW is a subset of the controls specified by SP 80-53, Annex 2 that are to be assessed under this contract.  Also, NIST's SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (Draft), is a possible resource in performing this SOW.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command  (ATEC) Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD). The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The ABNSOTD welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations. ATEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or ABNSOTDs use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of ABNSOTDs evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Notice, the ATEC may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP). However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.<BR><BR>Scope:<BR><BR>The purpose of this notice is to seek possible vendors capable of enhancing the design, development, and production for the Geometric Automated Video Enhanced Location System (GAVELS), a one-of-a-kind Government system.   The GAVELS system was originally developed in 1998 by Integrated Sensors Incorporated (ISI) of Utica, NY, which is no longer in business.<BR><BR>GAVELS is used to locate exploding artillery rounds and to track parachute<BR>airdrop items, including personnel and cargo, using the Universal Transverse<BR>Mercator (UTM) coordinates and altitude. The system has one major subsystem that records events or targets using digital video and records vital<BR>information such as GPS time, event number, and other information the user<BR>desires to include on each frame. The event must be recorded with multiple<BR>video cameras in order to calculate position using triangulation techniques.<BR>A second analysis subsystem uses the information from the camera sites and<BR>associates them with the GPS time as the common attribute.<BR><BR>The existing GAVELS employs Government owned software which must be modified, updated or replaced as necessary to accommodate new cameras, facilitate improved accuracy and improve usability.  Factors to consider in terms of improving usability must include all processes involved in setting up for test, collecting data and data reduction.  The contractor must also integrate new hardware and software into a complete, functional system. The intention of the enhancement is to make the system more accurate, easier to use and add the capability to use it during night tests.<BR><BR>The system enhancement will be conducted in a phased approach.  Phase 1A will be a design phase to include the development of a comprehensive system Enhancement Plan.  In Phase 1A, the primary tasks are to analyze the current GAVELS system capabilities and weigh those capabilities against the requirements; develop an Enhancement Plan; and design, build and demonstrate a prototype as a proof-of-concept.  Phase 1B will include producing and testing the system designed in Phase 1A.   The comprehensive Enhancement Plan will also include planning for follow-on phases to include planning for sustainment.  Due to this phased approach, it is crucial that the system be designed in an open and upgradeable architecture to facilitate the planned improvements.<BR><BR>Additional information about the GAVELS system is posted to the AMSCA website: https://www.amsca.army.mil.<BR><BR>Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 20 pages to perform the key requirements described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. <BR><BR> All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 30 calendar days from date of posting.  Per FAR 15.201 (c) Interested offerors may provide feedback on acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type deemed most appropriate for this requirement.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command has additional requirements to be procured on a sole source basis under Contract M67854-07-C-2062 (original solicitation M67854-06-R-2001) with Stauder Technologies, Inc., 115 Mexico Court Suite D, St. Peters, MO 63376 during the current contract period of performance through 17 December 2011. Additional software development, system integration, engineering services to include Field Service Representatives, and Target Location, Designation and Hands-Off System (TLDHS) units with spares are required for the war fighting effort.  The contract value will increase as funding becomes available.  Initially, a contract modification will be issued at approximately $2.8 million for an additional 103 TLDHS units.  The TLDHS units are required for Joint Close Air Support aircraft.  The $62 million requirement will be an increase to the Authorized Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the TLDHS.  The justification permitting other than full and open comp! etition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  It is not expected that any other contractor could perform the effort within budget and the required schedule due to ongoing software development and data requirements for interoperability.  Award or transition to any other source would result in duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The contract modifications will be issued on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis for the TLDHS units and associated spares, with software development to be issued on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee basis, and with systems integration and engineering services on a Time and Materials basis.  The total estimated cost of this procurement is $62 million, with a period of performance through 17 December 2011 for all items.  The initial modification for the additional 103 TLDHS units will he iss! ued by early March 2009 with a delivery schedule of 30 September 2009.  Any interested party may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement in writing.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to procure on a sole source basis, software development, systems integration, and support services for the Target Location, Designation and Hand-Off System (TLDHS) from Stauder Technologies, Inc., 115 Mexico Court, Suite D, St. Peters, MO. 63376.  The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) for the software development and integration, Time and Materials (T&M) for engineering services, and Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) for production options contract is anticipated.  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $12,006,000.00.  The Period of Performance is from FY 06 through FY 10 (five years).  The proposed contract action is to complete development and testing of TLDHS Block II and extend the Block II functionality to integrate n!  aval surface fires through the use of Naval Fire Control Systems (NFCS).  This effort encompasses support of software requirements, design, development, documentation, integration, and testing on the TLDHS.  It will allow continued development of TLDHS Block II software to maintain compatibility with other digital systems as those systems continue to upgrade and change their interfaces.  Stauder Technologies has developed and implemented unique algorithms in their software package.  This development has resulted in an original system whose function cannot be duplicated by any existing package or by a modification to any existing package.  The Government does not have the source code for TLDHS and therefore cannot provide it with a solicitation.  As a result of Stauder Technologies extensive experience, any competition would result in unrecoverable, extensive duplication of cost.  Moreover, award of the TLDHS development and support contract to any other source would result!   in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements and co uld upset the present program schedule by introducing unknown variables and schedule risk.  Based on the years taken to develop this capability to date, it is not expected that another source could step in, replicate the capability, test and field and remain on track for the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) in April 2006 and successfully support and pass the OT&E event.  Currently the Government does not have a technical data package which includes software.  No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding. However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement. All communications shall be in writing. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable to employ various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) information in support of the Joint Navigational Warfare Center (JNWC).  JNWC is the Department of Defenses focal point for Navwar.   JNWC will operate as a coordinating organization between organizations responsible for operating Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Systems, maximizing the protection of the systems for the warfighter, preventing the use of systems by the enemy, and integrating capability with U.S. Government agencies (e.g. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation) and coalition/allied partners.  
The mission of the Joint Navigational Warfare Center is to provide operational-level joint warfighter support through planning, integrating and coordinating navigational warfare (Navwar) policy and activities within and across geographic Areas of Responsibility (AOR), functional communities and DoD organizations in coordination with HQ STRATCOM.  The JNWC provides Navwar support to the combatant commanders Navwar operational planning and execution responsibilities, current and timely Navwar information to the warfighter, and participates in Service and joint training and exercise events globally.  Functions include independent Navwar testing, demonstrations, experiments, and assessments.  The JNWC develops, maintains and disseminates standards for Navwar analytical tools and methods, and develops and maintains Navwar modeling and simulation expertise for the DoD.  The JNWC has been designated as the sole repository of Navwar research, development, experimentation and development, and will function as an Information Analysis Center (IAC) to consolidate research, scientific and technical analysis on Navwar topics.  The requirement for this expertise is most notable in the engineering and analysis support provided, where the contractor will assess the performances of military weapon systems in Navwar environment, and then generate reports and studies that may provide advice both on the use of the weapon system, and on future engineering upgrades of the system.   The JNWC customer base includes joint and coalition warfighter, mission planners, tactics developers, system developers and testers.

<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested businesses to compete for a contract to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man. A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of one professional man-year and three and a half  technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Government would prefer that the Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,360 labor hours.  Award of one cost-reimbursement, level of effort contract (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contracts obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of a similar contract.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about September 29, 2009 through September 28, 2014.  Five (5) one-year options extending the performance of the contract beyond the fifth base year of the contract are planned.  The following is a list of equipment and special facilities required under contract:1.  Facilities for animal receipt, housing treatment and care.2.  Facilities for safe receipt, storage and use of toxic and radio-labeled chemicals.3.  Metabolism cages which permit humane housing of rats and mice for extended times and separate collection of urine, feces, exhaled volatiles and C02.4.  Facilities for humane housing and care of dogs and metabolism cages, which separate collection of urine and feces from dogs.5.  Equipment for quantitative chemical analysis e.g. HPLC, HPLC-MS, gas liquid chromatograph, UV-visible spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, HPLC-MS, plus the usual complement of minor laboratory equipment.6.  Equipment for quantitative analysis of radioactivity in chemical and biological samples, e.g. liquid scintillation counter, biological sample oxidizer and HPLC radio-detector.7.  Equipment for studies of chemical metabolism in vitro, e.g., liver perfusion apparatus, incubator, and homogenizer, centrifuges, water baths and extraction apparatus.Interested organizations should submit five (5) copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, for receipt by the agency within fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this sources sought synopsis.  In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the NAICS Code (541712) and whether or not they are a certified HUBZone, 8(a), Woman-Owned, Small Disadvantaged and/or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned  or Veteran-Owned Small Business concern.

SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/ MARKET SURVEY for Mk 39 EMATT 
DESCRIPTION:  This RFI is being conducted to identify viable contractors with knowledge of navy Anti-Submarine Warfare, Unmanned Undersea Vehicle systems and experience building low cost expendable systems for the next production run of Mk 39 EMATT.  The current Mk 39 EMATT contract has been fully exercised with the next production contract scheduled for FY 09. 
BACKGROUND: The Mk 39 EMATT is the US Navy's primary open ocean ASW training device and has been in production for 14 years.  The Mk 39 EMATT Mod 0 and 1 were build-to-print Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts while the current Mk 39 EMATTs are a build-to-performance specification FFP contract.  The later type will be used for this contract.   
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The Mk 39 EMATT is a low cost "A" size (3 feet long and 4 7/8 inches in diameter), expendable that is surface or air launched and acoustically and dynamically emulates threat submarines for ASW training purposes.  The Mk 39 EMATT is preprogrammed in the factory with 12 run profiles that are externally selectable by the fleet user for his ASW training needs.  The Mk 39 EMATT is instrumented to be dynamically tracked on all US Undersea Ranges for support of ASW training. Other key performance capabilities are:-Active Sonar and Torpedo echo repeater-Passive acoustic threat submarine emulation-Threat representative speeds / 3-8 knots-Realistic submarine heading and depth maneuvers and turn rates-Autonomous evasion maneuvers
The Mk 39 EMATT has a Portable Target Programmer (PTP) system that allows fleet users and Navy Undersea Range personnel to reprogram the Mk 39 in the field allowing for tailored training scenarios.MK39 EMATT's are currently being procured under contract (N00024-02-C-6151) awarded to Lockheed Martin Sippican (LMS) Inc.  LMS designed, and built all the production line equipment and test stations to support the EMATT production run.  The production line equipment is not available as GFE for the next contract; all production assembly and test equipment for this new contract will be the responsibility of the next contractor.  As a special contract requirement, the contractor shall design and build an end item test station that will be used to certify the proper acoustic, dynamic functions, ensure full electrical continuity of cables, and establish final vehicle roll and trim settings.  This end item test station will be used for the conditional acceptance of 100% of production Mk 39s. Final Acceptance of each lot of Mk 39s is based on successful completion of a series of Environmental tests, a static Acoustic Test and an In-water Test sequence.  The Environmental Testing, ! which will be the responsibility of the contractor to conduct, includes shock, vibration and high/low temperature test sequences.  The Prime Item Performance Specification for Mk 39 EMATT defines these test requirements.  No GFE including moulds, tools or test equipment will be supplied for this contract.  No government drawings are available for the Mk 39 EMATT.	In addition to the baseline Mk 39 EMATT, a submarine launched version, powered by a non-lithium source battery will be required under this contract as well.  The submarine launched version shall be safe to store on-board a submarine, all types, and shall be safe to launch from a submarine Trash Disposal Unit.  	An upgrade to the EMATT is required for compatibility with new surface and air platform sonar systems to meet fleet systems requirements.  This configuration will be required to transition the current EMATT pseudo-echo repeat active operation to a full duplex active system.  The MK39 EMATT will be delivered to the government in a Sonobuoy Launch Container and a protective gray over pack shipping container.	The MK39 EMATT shall be safely carried and launchable by all navy ASW fixed wing and rotary wing ASW aircraft and surface ships and shall conform to all the requirements delineated in NAVSEA Technical Manual S9310-AQ-SAF-010.  "Technical Manual for Batteries, Navy, Lithium Safety Program Responsibilities and Procedure".	A Portable Target Programmer (PTP) system for the Mk 39 EMATT will also be purchased under this contract.  The PTP is a light weight portable system that can be used to change the factory pre programmed acoustic and dynamic run profiles for the Mk39 EMATTs in the field.  The PTPs will also be required to conduct a self test of Mk 39s and have the ability to download new operational software.  A battery and AC operated PTP design will be also required. 
APPROACH:	The contract award will consist of a base year with 4 option years.  The contract Request for Proposals (RFP) is expected to be sent out in early 2009 with an award expected for 2009.  Plans are to purchase a combination of Mk 39 EMATTs and submarine launched Mk 39 EMATTs totaling up to 1200 units for each year. However, contract options will allow purchases as low as 300 per year. Delivery of the first lot (250-300 units) of Mk 39 EMATTs will be required 16 months after contract award.  Purchased plans for this contract also include up to 50 PTPs per contract year. Delivery of the first 20 is required 18 months after contract award.  Engineering Services up to 3,000 hours/year and Data Contract Line Items to support production are also included in this contract. First Article Testing of each Mk 39 EMATT Configuration is a Government option as described in the appropriate performance specifications.

The sample goniometer must have the ability to position the sample within two widely separated interaction point regions.  Two different goniometer configurations (sample translation and Kappa)  are  required  to  accommodate  a  wide  range  of  experimental  objectives.  The system must incorporate features to enable the use of future sample vacuum environments, cryostat or cyrostream.    Features to accommodate alignment fixtures for sample goniometer and detector mover must be integral to the overall design to achieve desired levels of accuracy. Goniometer design must enable rapid reconfiguration to maximize science output.   Vendors interested in performing this requirement are invited to provide the following information to SLAC Purchasing Office no later than 21 January 2009. The information may be submitted via email to the Contract Administrator at clam@slac.stanford.edu  or faxed to 650-926-8785. Responses shall include the following information: Reference number XPP-BIS-142116, Company name, DUNS Number, address, point of contact, phone number and email address; business size, disadvantage, 8(a), or HUBzone status; and , Evidence that the contractor has performed similar projects (past performance history). NO TELEPHONE OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATIONS OR POSTING STATUS.  This posting is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as commitment by SLAC nor will SLAC pay for information solicited. No basis for claim against SLAC shall arise as a result from a response to the Sources Sought or SLAC use of any information provided. SLAC reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR) or USAMRAA.  USACEHR is located at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Its mission is to direct and conduct research, development, testing and validation for the medical aspects of environmental surveillance and environmental health in support of force health protection.  Currently, there are many analyte-specific methods available for rapid detection of toxic chemicals in water.  USACEHR is taking a complementary approach by evaluating biologically-based systems that can respond to many different chemicals or classes of chemicals.  Current, toxicity sensors incorporate a wide range of biological components such as enzymes, bacteria, yeast, or small multicellular organisms with minimal maintenance requirements.  To represent substantial improvements over available technologies, we are seeking toxicity sensors with the potential to meet most or all of the following characteristics: (1) Test system responds within 60 minutes to a set of 12 representative diverse chemicals within a specified sensitivity range (see van der Schalie et al., 2006, Selection of a battery of rapid toxicity sensors for drinking water evaluation, Biosens. Bioelectron. 22:18-27); (2) Test system requires minimal preparation time (30 minutes or less) prior to water sample testing; (3) Test system and components remain viable for at least six months under a wide range of temperature (0 to 52C) and humidity (relative humidity: 5 to 95%); (4) Test system is simple to operate, uses minimal consumables, and is capable of being transitioned to a battery-powered hand-held device.  For candidate technologies with the potential to meet most of these requirements, a short fact sheet (three pages or less) is requested that summarizes specifications and capabilities in these areas:  (1) Toxicity sensor type  biological system used, endpoints monitored, and monitoring method; (2) Method description  number of steps, sample throughput rate, supplies and equipment needed, storage requirements (temperature, humidity, etc.), length of viability of test components, training required to conduct test, and size/weight/cube of test system (3) Response to toxic chemicals (data from 12 chemicals referenced above are most useful) - minimum concentration required for a response in an hour or less and false positive rate; (4) Technical maturity and potential for improvement.  Technology information provided will support a competitive down-selection process for toxicity sensor technologies.  Note that this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No RFP is available and USACEHR or USAMRAA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  Responses should be identified with W23MWK9014SSN1, and are due no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 2, 2009.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be held confidential. Please submit fact sheets to the attention of: USACEHR, ATTN: W23MWK9014SSN1, USAMRAA, 820 Chandler St., Fort Detrick, MD 21702. Fact sheets may be e-mailed to jennifer.jackson1@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFER  FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDSIFO NO.  BLM-2009-CHEU-001February 2009 - January 2010
IntroductionThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 12- to 15-year life of this project.
NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours 8:00 a.m. 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs.
Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact John Hamak at 806-356-1025 or Nabil Dia at 806-356-1023.
You must submit a written offer via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on January 30, 2009.  We will award the offers by 4:00 p.m. on February 2, 2009.  You may call John Hamak or Nabil Dia with questions about this IFO.
OffersThe Exhibit is the offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred index prices, etc.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  
Bidder proposals will be accepted January 30, 2009.  Please fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address:
BLM  Amarillo Field Office801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500Amarillo, TX  79101Attn:  John Hamak806-356-1041
Consideration of OffersBLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.
The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLMs judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions.
Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a partys assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction. 
TermInitial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence February 2, 2009  The delivery period will be for a term of twelve months ending January 31, 2010, unless either party cancels the transaction.  
The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
(1)	The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct; (2)	Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or(3)	The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM.
Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas LiquidsThe buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site.
No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period.
Liquidated DamagesBLM will remarket the NGL in the event an early contract termination occurs.  BLM will collect from the terminated party an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the contract price less the price at which BLM is able to remarket the NGL not purchased, using commercially reasonable efforts in an arms-length transaction.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and 

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(  ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror (  ) does (  ) does not certify that--

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.    

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price, labor hour purchase order to a vendor capable of meeting the below minimum requirements, and capable of completing the tasks required. The desired period of performance for the services described herein is anticipated to be 01 days after date of award and shall last for a period not to exceed 365 days (12 months). The services includes the contractor furnishing all labor, transportation, equipment, materials, supplies and supervision needed to perform all requirement elements listed and described within the attached performance work statement.  Section 6 of the work statement does provide a break down of Government Furnished Resources that will be provided during the course of task completion.

Pricing should be provided for each CLIN listed below:

CLIN 0001: Hourly labor rate for proposed employee and proposed labor category.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT:
1.0 Background:  Over the past 30 years, fires have dramatically increased in size and complexity, often stretching the capacity of the management systems in place. The Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) is a U.S. Govt. interagency project evolved from the need to streamline and improve these decision-making processes, as well as take advantage of improvements in technology, fire modeling, and geospatial analysis.  The former system, Wildland Fire Situation Analysis (WFSA) has been around for 30 years with little change, has become cumbersome to use, and is not scalable or flexible enough for todays fire management needs.  In June 2005, the National Fire and Aviation Executive Board chartered WFDSS to replace WFSA in 2009 with a system that has the following capabilities:
	Develops a scaleable decision support system for agency administrators
	Uses appropriate fire behavior modeling, economic principles, and information technology
	Supports effective wildland fire decisions consistent with Resource and Fire Management Plans

The Fire, Fuels, and Smoke Program at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory is one of several partners in the interagency team working towards WFDSS implementation.  Specifically, the Missoula Fire Laboratory provides consultation, algorithm and model development, and prototype interface segments.  The work described herein continues that support by initiating work of a weather spatial/time series interface segment to WFDSS.  WFDSS is on Government owned computers (of several platforms) at the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  However, these requirements do not require the deliverables to be put on WFDSS  The deliverables are algorithms and evaluation documents.  There is a complete programming team (IBM) that is implementing WFDSS.  The Firelab has nothing to do with that portion of the WFDSS.  As noted above, the Firelab provide consultation, algorithm and model development, and prototype interface segments. 

2.0 Task Objectives: 
.
1. Develop algorithms based on spatial and time series statistics of spatial fire weather patterns that can be used to generate artificial gridded weather sequences that preserve the spatial and temporal correlations.  

2. Evaluate practical methods for using the algorithms from objective #1 along with current weather observations to fulfill the intention of eventually generating any number of simulation scenarios at a continental (conterminous United States) scale. The practicality of these methods must account for the large volume of data (~8TB) given the limitations of available computer systems (memory, disk space, computing time etc.) and the WFDSS scalability objective defined above.

3.0  Minimum Personnel Requirements:

Please submit a resume for any personnel being proposed.  At a minimum, the resume must reflect the following elements:

1. Masters degree in Computer Science or Mathematics with emphasis in Statistical Methods;

2. Minimum 2 years experience in developing and interpreting time series and spatial correlation statistics;

3. Minimum 3 years experience in C++ programming;

4. Minimum 3 years experience in the R or S+ statistical programming languages;

5. Working knowledge of the Python programming language;

6. Demonstrated ability to design, code, test, and deploy interface segments to other systems.

4.0  Deliverables:  

Deliverable	Date
1. Summation of progress (progress report) with each invoice submitted for payment, or monthly, whichever is more frequent.

2. Algorithms to generate spatial correlation statistics and time series statistics for continental spatial weather sets at 8-km resolution.  Due 65 calendar days from the start date of the purchase order.

3. Report documenting recommendations and demonstrations of options for practical usage of the algorithm on available computers. Due 120 calendar days from the start of the purchase order.

5.0  Special Requirements/Considerations:  The Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory has several high performance computers that are not accessible outside the physical building because the Forest Services Information Systems Organization (ISO) cannot accommodate them in their security plan; there is no external network connection.  The data provided by the Forest Service for this project is on one of those computers.  As a result, work is to be performed at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, located at 5775 Hwy 10 W. Missoula, MT

The standard work week at the Fire Sciences Laboratory is Monday through Friday.  It is not anticipated that overtime will be required for completion of this requirement.  If the contractor determines that overtime is required, compelling evidence for why overtime is required shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for consideration.  The Contracting Officer will issue a decision regarding approval/disapproval of overtime.  

6.0 Government Furnished Resources:  Technical interface personnel of the Government will be provided to assist the contractor personnel in obtaining information pertinent to the required work.  The Government will furnish continental scale weather data at 8-km resolution and computers and software to perform the development and investigations.  These data files cover the continental United States on a daily basis from in 1980 through 2006 and require approximately 8 Terabytes of disk storage space.  All data and computing resources will be made available at the start of the contract.    

7.0 Travel and Training:  It is not expected that travel, per diem, or specialized training will be required to fulfill the requirements of this task.  

Contractor is required to successfully complete the USDA Computer Security Awareness Training and the USDA Privacy Basics training. The Forest Service will provide any access to training course(s) requirements such as the use of Government computer-Security Training and any other Safety or Security requirements required for the use of Government Property, Services, and Equipment prior to use.

RELOCATION EXPENSES TO SITUATE A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ONSITE IN MISSOULA, MT. WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Request for Proposal VA-776-09-RP-0028 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.  This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  This announcement incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-16 and VAAR 97-9.  NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  This BOS announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.  The Period of Performance dates for this requirement are February 9-13, 2009, and February 23-27, 2009 (approximately 25 sleeping rooms and required meeting space).  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration is providing a series of training sessions to the Administrations HR professionals.  The hotel must accommodate a total of 25 sleeping rooms (based on the timeframes), must provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B, C, and D below, and must provide lodging rates within the stated Government Per Diem.  The VA is hosting meetings in EACH of the selected geographic regions on BOTH of the listed Periods of Performance.  The VA intends to award one contract for each geographic region.  Therefore a responsive bid must include availability for both periods of performance.  A separate written solicitation document will not be issued.  A response to requirements listed below shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal.  A hotel contract shall be submitted with your proposal, along with descriptive literature to include but not limited to sleeping rooms, meeting room space diagrams and square footage; current menus.  The hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm.  The hotel facility must be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-366) (42 U.S. C. 12101 et. Seq.).  The hotel facility must accommodate an estimated 25 attendees with the following needs:  Part A:  Hotel Lodging  25 sleeping rooms for VA attendees to begin check-in on Monday with the majority of attendees to check out on Friday.  Rooms must be individual/private-sleeping rooms with toilet facilities at government prevailing per diem rate.

Hotel must be able to accommodate 25-30 participants in U-shape style set ups in the meeting room from 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM and be flexible with a starting and ending time should the meeting need to end early or be extended.  The meeting space should allow participants enough space to use laptops plus writing notepads side by side and allow easy movement.  The VA intends to meet for half the day in the Monday afternoons on the dates of performance, full day meetings Tuesday through Thursday, and half day Friday morning.  Facility must be able to provide high-speed wireless or wired Internet connection in the conference room and in the guest rooms.  General set up for the meeting space will need to include: table to accommodate a laptop and projector; large projection screen (6 x 6); LCD SVGA Projector; 2 Power Strips (if needed); 2  25 extension cords (if needed); Flipchart Kit (pad, easel, & markers).Part C: Food and Beverage: Possible mid morning and mid afternoon breaks during meetings.  Please provide menus and price list.   Part D:  Other requirements and special consideration/concessions: The VA will give considerable preference to proposals with limited cancellation and/or attrition liability.  Limiting the inherent risk to the group is a top priority.  All responsive vendors should include occupancy statistics from previous years during the requested dates to justify specific cancellation or attrition clauses.  The chosen facility should keep travel costs for transportation to a minimum.  Proposals should include proximity to local airport and variety of restaurants at property or within walking distance of the property (not to exceed 4 normal city blocks).  Discounted or complimentary parking rates for attendees will be given additional consideration when making award decision; Award will be made to the offeror determined to be the Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 evaluation factors.  Evaluation may be made with or without discussions with the offeror(s).  Technical proposals will be evaluated for limitation of cancellation and/or attrition liability, quality of accommodations and services, location, and possible past experience with government conferences.  VA reserves the right to conduct an on-site inspection of offered facilities.  Prices will be evaluated in terms of cost for accommodations and services, cancellation fees and attrition fees, and food and beverage/refreshments.  All responsible sources that can meet the requirements and provide items as listed above may respond to this solicitation by submitting cost and technical proposals, hotel contract and descriptive literature.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)  The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference.  This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research. The Government intends to establish a new contract to support and repair the Missile Guidance Set Test Set (MGSTS) as they fail. The NSN for the MGSTS is4935-01-440-5015AH, Honewell part number UG9762A3.
<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to Honeywell, Clearwater Florida.</p>
<p>Statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for the support and repair of the MGSTS, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source. It is considered that Honeywell Clearwater has the requisite skills, equipment, capabilities, system expertise, and resources to accomplish the required refurbishment of these items.</p>
<p>Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements; (2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and (3) equipment and material to appropriately refurbish the ordinance items. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.</p>
<p>A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This market survey amendment provides answers to the following questions which are considered common to all respondents to the "Market Survey for Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Operational Support and Analysis for FAA Terminal Automation Systems".  The original market survey posted on January 8, 2009 follows these responses.
1.  Question:  When is the RFP expected for this contract?FAA Response:  The purpose of the market survey is to assess if other vendors have the capability to perform this work.  Upon analysis of the responses, FAA will make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy.  There is no planned date at this time for release of an RFP.  See response to question 2 for additional timing considerations.
2.  Question:  What is the current contract number, value (including all option year) and the period of performance (start to end date).  FAA Response:  The contract number is DTDAWA-04-C-00025.  The value is $4,327,246.00, and the period of performance is February 2, 2004-April 30, 2009.
3.  Question:  What is the performance location and contract type of the new procurement?FAA Response:  The performance locations will be in Atlantic City and Washington D.C. Headquarters.  The contract type has not been determined at this time. 
4.  Question:  What is the NAICS code requirement? FAA Response: Please note responses are allowed an alternative NAICs code consistent with the areas of interest described in the market survey.  The Small Business Administration's North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort has been identified as "541512 Computer Systems Design Services" with a size standard of $25 M or less of gross annual receipts over the past year.  The FAA will consider vendor explanations for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of interest described in the market survey.  Include any explanations in a separate section that will not count against page limitations. 
5.  Question:  Would the winner of the resulting contract, if not the incumbent, have access to the current code that is being used or is it expected that they would bring their own.FAA Response:  Assume that the current code will not be available to any new vendor.  It would be expected that that new vendors would utilize their own code or develop new code. 
6.  Question:  Would there be time to develop something new or would one need to have something developed already?  FAA Response:  It may be necessary to allow some transition time to allow a new vendor to develop new code.  Based on the responses received, this area will be considered in the development of evaluation criteria to be included in the solicitation.  It would be preferable for a vendor to have experience with proven software tools, and/or a large amount of code ready at the time of award. 
7.  Question:  Would a subcontract with Lockheed or Raytheon in a different agency preclude someone from working on this task?  FAA Response:  The FAA considers that a relationship with Lockheed or Raytheon could jeopardize the independence of the IV&V contractor decision making and raise potential issues of conflicts of interest.  Likewise, the FAA considers that an existing relationship with the ADS-B contractor, ITT, or one of its subcontractors, could also jeopardize the independence of the IV&V contractor decision making and raise potential issues of conflicts of interest.    
Vendors are also advised that E-mail submission of responses to Samantha.E.Williams@faa.gov by the due date of COB 21 Jan 2009 is acceptable.  Please call Samantha Williams at 202-385-6156 to confirm submission of E-mail responses.    Note that the FAA will not be open on either January 19 or January 20 due to the inauguration and Martin Luther's birthday.        ----------------------------------------------The purpose of this market survey is to assess industry capability for Terminal Automation System Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Operational Support and Analysis effort for the FAA's Terminal Automation Group (ATO-T).  The effort is a continuation of work currently being performed by a small business.  
At this time, the acquisition strategy has not been determined.  The results of this survey will be used to determine if the requirement should be set aside for competition between small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort has been identified as "541512 Computer Systems Design Services" with a size standard of $25M or less of gross annual receipts over the past year.  FAA will consider vendor suggestions for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of effort described herein.  
FAA will also consider prime subcontractor relationships as long as the Small Business criteria are adhered to.   
The requirement is for Independent Verification and Validation Operational Support and Analysis for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS).  Raytheon Company is the STARS prime contractor.  Lockheed Martin is the CARTS Prime Contractor.  These systems collect information from radar (multilateration and ADS-B currently being considered as added sensors), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in the Terminal Service Areas.  
These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IV&V to ensure that system software evolution continues to decrease the accident risk, the number of incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.
The FAA is requesting that potential vendors provide appropriate responses of no more than 25 pages to the following FAA areas of interest:  
1.	Generalized Knowledge 	C++, ANSI C, and Linnux capabilities.	Familiarity with Sun Workstation Platforms, Motorola Power PCs, and other PC models. 	Experience with fusion of multiple sensor inputs into a single display.   	Experience with Kalman and similar filters. 	Experience re-hosting software on test bed platforms.	Experience which directly relates to the effort set forth in this announcement with sufficient narrative description.    
2.	Knowledge of Trackers and Tracker Registration related to surveillance sensors and systems similar STARS and ARTS:   	Overall experience with surveillance sensors and trackers.  	Development and analysis capability related to tracker algorithms. 	Experience with reconciling position reports with position truth.	Experience with dynamic bias correction	Knowledge of registration function and thoughts on potential for automating the function.   	Experience or thoughts on the affect of high performance targets on the correlator and altitude tracker.    	Knowledge and experience with extrapolation errors and conversion to stereographic plane.  
3.	Analysis experience in the following areas: 	Cost and benefits analysis.	Processing power and load analysis.	Analysis of Fusion tradeoffs	Analysis of filtering schemes.  	Analysis of Integration of multiple sensors 
4.	Test Capability.	Vendor capability for independent analysis/development of test tools to validate tracking algorithms and system performance.   
5.	Statistical Analysis 	Experience in analysis of live data recordings (DRF Tapes) to construct a baseline performance measure. 
6.	Company Resources:	Subject matter expert(s) and length of experience in surveillance or air traffic control systems.    	Personnel experience and length of experience in analysis and assessment of design, development, and implementation of Air Traffic control safety functions software.    	Potential Program Director(s) knowledgeable in air traffic control system issues, tracking and safety. 
Vendors responding to this survey must meet the following criteria:
1.	Be a Certified Small Business in accordance with NAICS Code 541512, or a suggested code consistent with the areas of interest described above.2.	Must not have a relationship between prime contractors Lockheed Martin or Raytheon Corporation during the last 10 years with regard to Air Traffic Control software, hardware, or support.  3.	Must not have an existing financial or contractual relationship between prime contractors Lockheed Martin or Raytheon Corporation. 
The responses to this survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this market survey.  Any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Proprietary information in the response should be marked as proprietary.

Note that the FAA will not be open on either January 19 or January 20 due to the inauguration and Martin Luther's birthday.        ----------------------------------------------The purpose of this market survey is to assess industry capability for Terminal Automation System Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Operational Support and Analysis effort for the FAA's Terminal Automation Group (ATO-T).  The effort is a continuation of work currently being performed by a small business.  
At this time, the acquisition strategy has not been determined.  The results of this survey will be used to determine if the requirement should be set aside for competition between small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort has been identified as "541512 Computer Systems Design Services" with a size standard of $25M or less of gross annual receipts over the past year.  FAA will consider vendor suggestions for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of effort described herein.  
FAA will also consider prime subcontractor relationships as long as the Small Business criteria are adhered to.   
The requirement is for Independent Verification and Validation Operational Support and Analysis for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS).  Raytheon Company is the STARS prime contractor.  Lockheed Martin is the CARTS Prime Contractor.  These systems collect information from radar (multilateration and ADS-B currently being considered as added sensors), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in the Terminal Service Areas.  
These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IV&V to ensure that system software evolution continues to decrease the accident risk, the number of incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.
The FAA is requesting that potential vendors provide appropriate responses of no more than 25 pages to the following FAA areas of interest:

In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.

You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitledRegister with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address. Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.

Key requirements for JBSDS Increment 2 include:<BR><BR>"	An active LIDAR system with at least a TRL 6 or better for hardware and a real time bio discrimination algorithm<BR>"	Discrimination Sensitivity (bio agent cloud vs. other cloud) during day and night conditions of 1000 ACPLA at 1 Km.<BR>"	Low false alarm rate to battlefield interferents and common, localized background aerosols<BR>"	Operationally eye and skin safe<BR><BR>Tech Demo V will include bio simulant releases as well as interferent releases in the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) as well as open air releases, at ranges up to 4 km, to determine the sensitivity of selected technologies and their ability to detect and discriminate bio aerosol clouds while not false alarming to interferents.  At least half of the releases will be blind trials.  The JABT is a 10 meter wide, 116 meter long tunnel, open on both ends, that is used for system sensitivity measurements.  Bio aerosol simulants are disseminated within the tunnel at known concentrations.  Systems under test are typically situated 1.2 km from the tunnel opening and aligned to have a clear line of sight thru the entire tunnel length.   <BR><BR>The JPM-BD is interested in identifying technologies for participation in the field demo that meet the key requirements above.  Mature technologies that meet the key requirements and are capable of performing in a field environment will be considered.  Selected technologies will be evaluated and modeled by the JPM-BD for potential applicability in JBSDS Increment 2 by themselves or as an integrated component of multiple technologies. The U.S. Army is under no obligation to select any technology for the Field Demo or for future acquisition programs. The field demo will offer participants an opportunity to obtain unique performance data that can be used in their development work.  The US Army is not responsible for any costs incurred by the participants as a result of attending this Field Demo.<BR><BR>To be responsive to this announcement developers/sponsors must supply the following in writing to the JPM Bio Defense, ATTN: SFAE-CBD-BD/Ogba Melles, Building E3548, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010, no later than close of business 27 February 2009: A description of the equipment proposed that includes performance capabilities, technology employed and physical characteristics; a historical synopsis of the development; all pertinent test reports and performance models; a photograph of the system, safety assessment (include laser safety information for laser systems) and the JBSDS Increment 2 key requirements that you anticipate demonstrating.  Also provide any improvements to the equipment that was used in prior Government testing (Joint Field Trials and TREs). Submit information requested electronically via email or delivered by mail on a CD/DVD.

Thecontract value will increase as funding becomes available.  Initially, acontract modification will be issued at approximately $2.8 million for anadditional 103 TLDHS units.  The TLDHS units are required for Joint Close AirSupport aircraft.  The $62 million requirement will be an increase to theAuthorized Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the TLDHS.  The justificationpermitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), asimpl! emented by FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No OtherSupplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  It is not expected thatany other contractor could perform the effort within budget and the requiredschedule due to ongoing software development and data requirements forinteroperability.
