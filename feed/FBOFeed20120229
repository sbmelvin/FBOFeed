<DESC>Repair Aprons Phase 2B, Project No. WWCX 05-1036B  The scope of the Repair Aprons Phase 2B (Project Number WWCX 05-1036B) requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to repair 12,000 square yards (SY) of apron at Hangar 8 on Thule Air Base (AB), Greenland.  The airfield at Thule AB was constructed in 1952-53.  In 1993-94, the runway was repaired and new pavement placed.  The aprons are now cracked and the pavement must be replaced.  The pavement has deteriorated to the point that loose pieces of pavement could cause foreign object damage to aircraft.  Also the sub-grade has failed causing depression in which melt water is gathering adjacent to the paved areas.    The work includes but is not limited to: 1.	Repair 12,000 SY of apron at Hangar 8 2.	Establish and Operate quarry, rock crushing plant and asphalt plant 3.	Repair work must correct deficient sub-grade drainage and reconstruct sub-grade depressions 4.	Base course will be leveled and deteriorated pavement replaced 5.	Painting and marking pavement  The contractor shall be responsible for determining the amount of work needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract specifications and drawings.  All quantities listed in the contract documents are estimates only. The awardee will be responsible for determining actual needs. The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work. The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The performance period for this project shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). &rdquo;Notice to Offerors: Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.&rdquo; Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation. It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically sometime in Mar 2012 with offers due 30 days thereafter. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) and FAR 6.302-4 International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms except when procurement from such sources is not feasible. No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed. Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>This is a sole source procurement.<br>The selected vendor already has the infrastructure in place to support the eDocs application as they originally provided the programming support to deploy the system. DLA Document Services requires this leverage of expertise as eDocs was a COTS product that has been specifically tailored to meet the needs of the end users and cannot be replaced with a new solution at this time as it is already in production. The expertise leverages several software programs that have customized this solution to include: JAVA, Oracle, SQL, Visual Basic, DocWorks, and Windows 7 environment to perform the additional functional requirements outlined in the Scope of Work.  This system is already in full production, and the government has already invested $700,000.00. To procure a new system and/or vendor would cost significantly more than the cost of this action.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Request for Quotation (RFQ) number A12PS00611 is to provide Facilities and Related Services for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs (AS-IA) "2012 Tribal Consultations" to be held in Miami, FL on April 2-3, 2012. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services or Third Party Event Planning Services. BIA will not consider a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel. A quotation which requires the government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be considered technically non-responsive. 
This acquisition is 100% set aside for Buy Indian under the authority of 25 U.S.C. 47. Economic enterprises that are not at least fifty one percent owned by a Native American or Alaskan Native, or Tribally-owned may not offer quotes in response to this notice and any quotes submitted by other than Indian owned businesses shall not be considered. Quoters shall certify that they are Indian owned. Indian Economic Enterprise means (i) any business activity owned by an Indian or an Indian Tribe that is established for the purpose of profit provided that such Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise, and that the Indian or Indian Tribe shall receive a majority of the earnings from the contract, to include entities established pursuant to the Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 USC 1601 and 43 USC 1626(e)(1) and (2); and (ii) the management and daily business operations of an eligible Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe. The individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the firm conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout these time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) at the time of contract award; and (3) during the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, urban, or corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 USC 1601).
This procurement is being issued as a Buy Indian set-aside under NAICS Code 721110. BIA contemplates a competitively awarded fixed price purchase order. This requirement is for the 2012 Tribal Consultations, which requires lodging, audio-visual, light refreshments and meeting rooms. AS-IA has selected Miami, FL as the training site. All Indian-owned or Tribally-owned hotels in Miami are invited to submit quotes in response to this notice. Respondents shall provide all resources necessary to provide contracted services as set forth in the statement of work (SOW).

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Highmark Medicare Services, Inc. under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0001Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a large purchase for NSN 4730-01-392-8698. Specifications, drawings or standards are not available from the Government. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only offers based on approved sources under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) 1. Current approved manufacturer is CLEVELAND GEAR COMPANY, INC. (59958) P/N 0803DH-S0801211. This solicitation opens on 3/16/12 and closes 4/16/12. This requirement is for a quantity of 10 each. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based on combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The proposed contract is unrestricted. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Navy Virtual SYSCOM (partners NAVSUP, NAVAIR, SPAWAR and NAVFAC) along with other Navy activities, is conducting a rolling admission per the terms and conditions of the SeaPort Enhanced (Seaport-e) Multiple Award Contracts.  The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones and to voluntarily re-certify their size status.
  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is currently $27 Million.  It is anticipated that this size standard will increase to $35.5 Million on 12 March 2012.

Current Seaport-e contracts have the following 
characteristics:

-Offers are evaluated on Best Value
-ID/IQ contracts with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price- Incentive (FPI), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee(CPFF), Cost-Plus- Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type Task Orders.  No Time-and-Material (T&M) task orders are allowed.
-All requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices.
-Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders
-Seaport-e program goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors.
-Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.
-Only one ID/IQ contract award is allowed for individual companies as a Prime; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes.
-Task Orders are competed in one of seven geographic zones (Northeast, National Capital, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest) based on the place of performance for the solicited requirements.
-Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance.
-The basic ID/IQ contracts limits pass-through charges, caps maximum fees, annual escalation, and requires cost savings.

Awards made during the rolling admission process will have the same or similar characteristics.

Oral proposals will not be conducted.
  Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions.

The Government desires an increase in Small Business, HubZone, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and 8(a) concerns.  Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.

<a href="mailto:henry.dukes@va.gov">Long Island National Cemetery - Label, Package and Ship</a>
<DESC>The National Cemetery Administration is soliciting offers under Solicitation No. VA-786-12-R-0087 for the following:

The purpose of this contract is to package, label, palletize and haul up to 50 monuments from Calverton National Cemetery to Long Island National Cemetery in one shipment each week.   Approximately 100% of each week's orders are marble headstones (4" x 42" x 13", weighing approximately 210 lbs; A few (estimate less than 25 per year) are granite markers (3" x 12" x 24", weighing approximately 84 lbs).

Timeliness Required
Monuments, with the exception of those identified for accelerated delivery, shall be delivered within one (1) business day from pickup.  Deliveries should normally be on Tuesdays of each week.

	Specific requirements for delivery to the cemetery are as follows:
"	Deliver each week's shipment during 8:30 am to 11 am or 1 pm to 3 pm on Tuesdays.  If Tuesday is a federal holiday, the contractor has one added business day to complete the delivery.
"	Notify the destination cemetery 24 hours prior to arrival regarding the time that delivery will occur so as to ensure appropriate staff and equipment are available for offloading and acknowledging receipt. 
"	Deliveries must be made to a single destination within the cemetery.  The contractor is not responsible for removing packaging materials nor pallets.  
"	The contractor must ensure the palletized monuments are placed at the rear of the delivery vehicle to ensure the ability of the cemetery personnel to offload pallets when using a forklift.
"	The contractor must ensure that a chain of custody document, see attachment - TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENT FURNISHED HEADSTONES, MARKERS, OR NICHE COVERS, is completed upon pickup of monuments, signed and dated, and a copy with the receivers signature provided to the cemetery staff upon delivery of monuments.
"	The hauler is not required to wait for the cemetery staff to complete an inspection of delivered items.   When monuments are not inspected immediately upon receipt, the contractor must notate the chain of custody document with: "subject to inspection for latent discrepancies".

 Work Locations and Contact Information

Farmingdale, NY 11735-1211

Labels Required
The contractor shall provide a shipping label for all items.  The label shall be at least 5 inches wide by 4 inches long.  Labels shall completely adhere to the front of the package and shall be overlaid with transparent adhesive plastic tape that completely covers the label to prevent removal, smearing, or blurring of the information.   Shipping labels may not be covered or obscured in any way by individual packaging or banding materials that would make the labels unreadable.

The contractor shall provide all packaging materials, pallets, or special crating and use them in accordance with normal industry standards and commercial best practices to assure acceptance by the carrier and minimal damage during transport.

Packaging for items shall consist of a two-part carton constructed of single wall corrugated fiberboard.

The back of the carton shall fit completely over the back of the monument with the two side flaps folding over each respective surface.  The flaps of the carton must meet or overlap so as to completely enclose the monument.  The halves of the carton shall be secured around the monument with half-inch plastic banding or 2 inch filament tape.   Two bands shall secure the carton around the monument's entire height (from top to bottom) and two additional bands shall secure the carton around the monument's entire width.  Banding pressure should be such that it causes no damage to the edges of the stone when shipped.  

Palletizing Required
Each pallet or crate must not exceed 3,500 lbs.  When items are shipped together on pallets, sufficient non-steel banding in conjunction with stretch wrap along with individual packaging materials shall be used to prevent damage to the items during shipment.

The following specifications must be used in conjunction with standard 42" x 48", 4-way wood pallets.

"	 All monuments and packing material must be contained within the dimensions of the pallet with no overhang.
"	The contractor must palletize headstones on pallets in good repair with a minimum of three stringers having a capability for lift access from all four directions.  
"	Pallets loaded with more than 15 upright headstones are not acceptable.

Precautions for Satisfactory Performance

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only. The US Army Contracting Command  New Jersey at Fort Dix is conducting market research for a System Integrator to develop and implement Increment II of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System  Army (IPPS-A). The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's Increment II System Integrator requirements. IPPS-A is designated a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program under the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO). IPPS-A is a pre-Major Automated Information System (pre-MAIS) and a Defense Business System (DBS) program. It is managed by the Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), IPPS-A Project Management Office, in Alexandria, VA 22332. The purpose of the IPPS-A System Integrator contract is to obtain contractor services for the design, development, integration, testing, implementation, and deployment of a PeopleSoft Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, which integrates Army Business Processes and existing Army data into a single Human Resource and pay system.
Statement of Need:IPPS-A will provide integrated personnel and pay management for all components (Active, Guard and Reserve). IPPS-A will be a web-based tool, developed through the use of a COTS ERP product, available 24 hours a day, accessible to soldiers, (HR professionals, Combatant Commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army. The Army is developing IPPS-A using a hybrid solution that includes the use of PeopleSoft ERP software, third party products, and Agile Development to deliver integrated personnel and pay capabilities. IPPS-A is being developed in two Increments with multiple releases. Increment I, currently in development, will provide a single, multi-Component trusted database with reporting capabilities that will provide a single record for all Army Soldiers. Increment I will serve as a trusted data source for personnel and human resources data for the entire Army, allow for interface communications, and produce multi-Component reports. Increment I will provide the system infrastructure necessary to build Increment II and future releases.
Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database and PeopleSoft foundation delivered by IPPS-A Increment I. IPPS-A Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. The Army will employ incremental development for Increment II, developing capabilities in 14-18 month cycles, with fielding of capabilities every 12 months. Total system functionality will be delivered across four releases: personnel accountability, including a Soldier self-service module (Release 2.0), essential personnel services (Release 3.0), pay services, including automated pay actions (Release 4.0), and remaining personnel services (Release 5.0). Each release of IPPS-A will incrementally build upon the prior releases design and capability. 
The Army will use the Army PeopleSoft 9.1 ERP and Oracle 11g database capabilities developed in Increment I, along with Application Technologies outside of the core, to meet user requirements for the total system. The IPPS-A PMO fully expects the incoming System Integrator to apply patches, bundles, and feature packs to upgrade any existing custom software prior to Increment II development. In addition, if major application releases (e.g., PeopleSoft 9.2) are generally available prior to major development activities for each IPPS-A release, the System Integrator will be expected to analyze the feasibility of applying a major application upgrade, and subsequently execute the upgrade if directed by the Government.
The Army seeks to engage a contract System Integrator for the total development and implementation of IPPS-A Increment II, from the transition of fielding support for Increment I through development of Increment II, Releases 2-5, until attainment of Full Deployment (FD) and transition to a post-deployment sustainment support contractor. The anticipated scope of the work shall include:	Program Management	Information Assurance	Application Security	Systems Engineering	Technical Architecture	Software Configuration and Development	System Integration	Data Management and Data Migration	Environment Development and Management	Disaster Recovery	Design Reviews	Life-Cycle Management	Integrated Logistics Support	Test and Evaluation	Classified Products Support	Transition
Prospective IPPS-A System Integrator contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in the disciplines listed above in order to meet the programs requirements. Prospective contractors shall also demonstrate experience in ERP implementation, Agile and modular development, and incorporation of inventive and evolving technologies in a cost-effective and proficient manner that will advance its performance and support to the IPPS-A project. The prospective contractor shall also have knowledge of Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Human Resources and Army Pay Systems, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) processes and operations. In addition to these standards, the IPPS-A system and data must be compliant with the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) and follow Common Human Resources Information Standards (CHRIS) from design through sustainment. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) has been attached to this notice for a more specific description of the type of services that may be required.
Capability Statement:An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Governments requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing large ERP implementation projects and government contracts of the same or similar nature, experience implementing the products identified above, and ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, tasks, e.g., through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc. The statement shall include the sources website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only); business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. The client reference must be for work relevant to this requirement performed within the last three years and include the agency supported, a client point of contact, whether the work was performed as a prime or a subcontractor, delivery date or period of performance, and a brief description of the effort. This statement shall not exceed 10 pages. The page limit does not apply to advertising material such as company brochures and catalogs.

<DESC><br>Radioisotope Identifiers (RIIDs) will be tested over a several-month period during CY12, beginning in approximately May 2012.    If your instrument(s) is selected for this cycle of testing, Defense Threat Reduction Agency and/or its representatives will negotiate an arrangement for temporary use of your instrument(s) over this period.  Testing is conducted at no cost to the responding firm, and results will be supplied to the responding firm, on his instrument(s) only, after conclusion of testing and data analysis.<br><br>Instrument submittal criteria<br><br>Only mature, commercially available instruments are sought for this test campaign.  In order for an instrument to be accepted, a brief statement on each nominated instrument is required from the manufacturer with the following information:<br>a.	Does the instrument fall under the conventional definition of a RIID?  For example, it must be manportable, provide identification of detected radioisotopes, and display these results on the instrument monitor.<br>b.	The model number and a brief description of the instrument.  <br>c.	How long has the instrument been commercially available?<br>d.	Approximately how many units have been sold?<br>e.	A short statement on whether the instrument(s) has been tested against the ANSI 42.34 standard.  <br>f.	The testing score for each radioisotope listed in the above standard.<br>If the instrument has not been tested according to this standard, provide a brief statement of any comparable testing conducted, including results.<br><br>The Instrument submission criteria shall be submitted no later than 23 March to the following email address:  Larry.Karch_Contractor@dtra.mil]<br>Qualifying Process for Cycle 7 DTRA RIID testing<br><br>The government will examine the information submitted and decide whether the submission criteria will be accepted for RIID testing.  Interested parties should note; however, that as long as the as the RIID(s) offered is a commercial product, man-portable, and a gamma spectrometer, the possibility of rejection is remote. <br>The government will notify the responding firm that his offer of RIID(s) - (maximum of two with one designated as "Primary") - has been accepted no later than 02 April 2012. The responding firm will be provided contact information shipping and how for testing will proceed.<br><br>The responding firm is cautioned by the government that his offered RIID(s) must arrive at the DTRA test site by COB on 20 April 2012 and an operator's manual must also be provided. (It is most desirable that an operator's manual be provide as soon as an offer of RIIDs is accepted and in advance of the arrival of the actual RIID(s).<br><br>As with prior cycles of DTRA RIID testing, instruments proceed through two or more sub-cycles, of varying difficulty rating.  The first sub-cycle is characterized by considerably less difficulty than subsequent sub-cycles.  This "A" sub-cycle can also accommodate a greater number of RIIDs than subsequent rounds.  Therefore, as in Cycle 6, we plan to qualify instruments in sub-cycle 7A for further testing.  It's estimated that not all RIIDs will survive to follow-on sub-cycles.  Criteria for proceeding to these later rounds were developed for Cycle 6.<br><br>The instrument qualifying criteria established for Cycle 6 will be implemented in the Cycle 7 RIID evaluation.  Additional information regarding the test criteria can be located at the following website:  <br><br>http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/Default.aspx?pg=321<br><br> It is a fairly simple test matrix to determine instrument isotope identification and detection capabilities based on the results obtained from previous evaluations (Cycles 3-6).  The scores will indicate which units have the necessary minimum identification capabilities to continue.  This is significant since the primary focus of the evaluations and the overall program is the detection and identification of SNM and other threat materials, including shielding and masking test scenarios.  The qualification test sources and configurations were therefore specifically selected to help predict some of these critical capabilities, insuring that program resources are spent in the most efficient and beneficial manner.  The full results from sub-cycle 6A testing have validated the qualification test matrix as an effective criterion for down-selecting instruments.<br><br>Please refer to the attached document detailing the Cycle 6 Qualification Matrix.<br>

All work shall be performed under sanitary conditions as specified by the Joint Commission. Physical separation of clean and dirty linen is required. In no case shall clean and soiled linen share the same physical space.  Plants in which the work is done shall be open to inspection of sanitary conditions by Government representatives. After processing, laundered articles shall be in serviceable and sanitary condition, meeting established quality and performance requirement standards.

*The Laundry Plant layout/design should incorporate a "design for asepsis" whereby clean linen does not come into contact with soiled linens nor share the same physical space, thus avoiding cross-contamination or reintroduction of bacteria once processed.

Physical separation of the soil-sort area is required in order to limit the potential for contamination of personnel or clean, processed textiles.  Exhausting air to the outdoors prevents reintroduction of contaminants onto clean items and into clean work areas.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requirement for a High Frequency Ultrasound System.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies and other than small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from small business manufacturing companies and large business may also respond that can provide a High Frequency Ultrasound System as detailed below. The vendor must also be capable of providing extended service agreement coverage for multiple years after the initial warranty has expired.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be equivalent to the salient characteristics described herein.</p>
<p>The High-Frequency Ultrasound System will be used to image anatomical and physiological features of small animals used as model systems for human disease and injury. The high frequency ultrasound system should enable the researcher to obtain in vivo anatomical, functional, physiological and molecular data simultaneously, in real-time and with resolution down to 30 &mu;m.</p>
<p>High frequency transducers <br />&bull; At least 3 transducers should be included with frequencies ranging from 15 MHz to 55 MHz <br />&bull; Each transducer should have adjustable focus depths <br />&bull; Each high frequency transducer should be able to deliver a usable frame rate of 300-400 frames per second</p>
<p>Integrated imaging station <br />&bull; Allows secure positioning of the animal (rats and mice) on a heated handling table, which maintains the animal's physiological body temperature and overall physiological function. <br />&bull; Platform should be integrated with an isoflurane-based anesthesia system that can be connected to oxygen or air.</p>
<p>Monitoring of physiological function and data <br />&bull; ECG, heart rate, temperature and respiration should be recorded and displayed on the monitor screen alongside the images. This information should be able to be exported and saved. <br />&bull; ECG and Respiration gating can be controlled by the user.</p>
<p>M-Mode <br />&bull; M-Mode imaging should produce quantifiable images to characterize moving anatomy, such as a cardiac wall motion, by selecting a line of the B-Mode image and observing it over time. <br />&bull; Should be able to sample volume size down to 50 microns<br />&bull; M-Mode cine loop with a maximum length of 30 seconds. <br />&bull; Should allow the user to steer the sample volume to any angle the user chooses.<br /><br />Doppler Mode Capabilities<br />&bull; The equipment should be capable of using Color Doppler Imaging to produce an image of directional flow in blood vessels. The system should overlay colors on the image of the blood vessels to represent the speed and direction of blood flow through the vessels. <br />&bull; In Pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) Mode, the transducer should be able to detect motion and then show the readings on screen in a spectral display. <br />&bull; The sampling rate for PW Doppler should range from 1-2 kHz to 125 kHz; and be able to detect velocities from a few mm/s to approximately 6 m/s. <br />&bull; The sweep speed parameter should be selectable within a range from 0.25 seconds at 4000 Hz to 5.1 seconds at 200 Hz. <br />&bull; 3D Power Doppler Mode will collect Power Doppler data during a 3D-Mode acquisition and be able to reconstruct a 3D volume that is integrated with the surrounding B-Mode 3D volume.</p>
<p>3D Imaging <br />&bull; 3D-Mode imaging should provide tools to create and manipulate three-dimensional renderings and make volumetric measurements of objects viewed with high-resolution ultrasound. <br />&bull; Acquires a series of 2-dimensional "slices" (as small as 10 &mu;m) and assembles them into a 3D data set that can then be visualized and manipulated. Targets (for example, tumor growth) can be segmented and volumetric measurements made. <br />&bull; 3D imaging can be used in B-Mode, Power Doppler Mode or Contrast mode imaging procedures. <br />&bull; 3D acquisition functionality allows for precise control of step size, range and slice thickness. This functionality can be integrated with ECG and respiration gating to suppress heart and respiratory errors. <br />&bull; Range = # of slices x step size. <br />&bull; Maximum number of 500 slices. <br />&bull; Range: min value = 0.5 mm; max value = 60 mm <br />&bull; Step Size: min value = 0.03175 mm; max value = 0.5 mm;</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, in Miami, FL intends to award a sole source purchase order to charter a research vessel the M/V Spree, operated by Spree Expeditions, Ins. This requirement is for a 7-day cruise operation in the Tortugas Region of Florida. The research cruises will involve intensive scuba operations. Due to overfishing of the snapper-grouper complex, research to assess the effectiveness of a network of no-take marine ecological reserves in the Florida Keys is a high-priority item for the National Marine Fisheries Service, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, National Park Service, and State of Florida. Research has been conducted intensively in the Florida Keys since the mid-1990s. This research cruise, supported by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program, is critical for the continuation of the research to assess marine protected areas (MPAs) and to support the NMFS ecosystem based approach to fishery management for the Florida coral reef tract and the NOAA marine and coastal spatial management goals. A 7-day research cruise will be conducted in along the deeper areas of the Florida reef tract (SE Gulf of Mexico). Diving operations require ten full operational days. Charter vessel and operations will be in accordance with NOAA Charter Vessel Policy. The charter will include accommodations and food for a party of 24 researchers, and diving support for researchers including Nitrox gas compressor system and scuba tank fills.

<CONTACT>michael.fanizzo@navy.mil
<DESC>If interested, please forward a capabilities statement to michael.fanizzo@navy.mil. The statement should provide past performance history, facilities description, and entity size. The statements should be less than ten pages.

NAVFAC has a requirement to fabricate an interface for the Elevated Causeway system(ELCAS). NAVFAC will provide the design, of which the drawings are attached to this synopsis. 

The existing ELCAS (M) 3-Wide and 5 Wide Pontoon Barge Ferries are 24 and 40 ft wide (respectively) by 4 ft  6 in. deep.  The non-powered ELCAS Barge Ferries deploy ELCAS components from ship to shore by Legacy Navy Lighterage (NL) that are 5 feet deep and connected via a shear connector / flexor connector arrangement described in F5220-AA-TMM-010, the System Installation and Operation Manual.
  When the Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) was fielded starting in 2006, the hull depth was purposely increased to 8 feet to increase safety and operation in higher seas.  However, the Shear Connectors and Flexor Connectors no longer mate with the shorter ELCAS Pontoon Barge Ferries.  Three (3) NL Warping Tugs (WTs) remain in Navy inventory to provide prime movers for the ELCAS system and ensure ELCAS is still self-deployable.

The INLS / ELCAS Interface frame has been designed to mount on the ELCAS Barge Ferries deck to mate with an INLS Causeway Ferry Powered Module (CFPM) or, alternatively an INLS Warping Tug (WT). The Interface frames dual functionality allows the users to choose the INLS craft of opportunity available to meet the ELCAS deployment mission, and will allow the Navy to retire the remaining NL WTs.
   For the CFPM, the frame contains shear connectors and flexor connectors (male and female).  When reversed the frame has Ultra High Molecular Weight fender padding to cushion against the WTs push knees.  The WTs hogging winches are used to cinch the ELCAS Barge Ferry tight against the push knees like a Mississippi Tow Boat. 

The attached drawing provides the fabrication requirements and details, as well as an outfitting Bill of Material.

Scope and Purpose:  This Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide a leased equipment agreement for Baxter Home Choice and/or Home Choice Pro Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) units by Baxter Healthcare Corporation for the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, Tampa, Florida.  Each unit is to be provided with a Home Choice Pro Carrying Case.  The lease  shall include all installation, maintenance, service, and upgrades as necessary and appropriate.  
Location:  These devices will be provided to inpatients and outpatients of James A. Haley Veterans Hospital to provide peritoneal dialysis as prescribed by a physician for life essential dialysis services.  
Procedure:  Peritoneal dialysis services will be managed by the Nephrology and Renal Care department, and APD cyclers will be provided to inpatients and outpatients to provide peritoneal dialysis services for these patients.  For inpatients, there is typically a requirement for one or two of the basic Baxter Home Choice APD units.  These devices are required on a short notices basis and must be maintained at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital.  Nephrology staff will manage these units for inpatient use.
The requirement for outpatient use varies by patient demand.  However, there is typically a requirement for 12-16 units at any given time.  Once a physician's order has been given for automated peritoneal dialysis, the patient will use the Baxter Home Choice Pro unit to perform the APD procedure as ordered by the physician.  Use of the device will continue indefinitely until there is a change in the patient status or the physician changes the treatment orders.  Upon delivery of the physician's order to the vendor, the vendor shall deliver the APD device to the patient's home and provide instructions for use, cleaning, and user maintenance as required.  
Data Management: 	The Baxter Home Choice Pro uses a patient compliance card to program the treatment plan and record patient use information.  Patients will be provided a compliance card to be inserted into the Baxter Home Choice Pro device provided by the contractor, and the compliance card will be used to program the instrument settings as well as record therapy information.  Patients will be instructed to bring the compliance card with them to follow-up appointments for review and therapy adjustments as ordered by the physician.  The data on the compliance card will be interfaced with a computer and card reader in the Nephrology and Renal Care department at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital for reading, interpretation, and programming of the APD cycler.  At this time there is no interface through Vista Clinical Procedures for interfacing clinical data to Vista Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  However, future requirements and interface options may develop that may allow the data to be directly interfaced with Vista and/or Vista Imaging.

REQUIREMENT:   

The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking to fulfill the mandated federal agency energy management requirements of increasing renewable energy consumption as stated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), Executive Order (EO) 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management," and EO 13514, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance."  In concert with these requirements, we are seeking potential sources for a Pre Test Well Study as well as Test Well Drilling, Well Testing, and Report submission at the following site:

Facility	Address
Boise VA Medical Center	500 West Fort Street
Boise, ID 83702

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to evaluate the feasibility for geothermal groundwater of 200 degree Fahrenheit (F) or higher temperature and flow of 1000 GPM or higher for developing Direct Geothermal system(s) to support the Boise VA Medical Center. 

The steps in the Statement of Work (SOW) include: 
1.	A Pre Test Well Study for identification of a location for a test well.
2.	Providing that the results of the study are favorable, Test Well Drilling, Well Testing, and Report support services to identify and address any concerns that may be present for potentially developing Direct Geothermal Systems at Boise VA Medical Center. 

In order to develop energy investment initiatives to move the Medical Center from previously verified or adjusted status quo baseline to a state of improved energy consumption and cost effectiveness, VA needs to develop applicable investment initiatives. The Pre Test Study, Test Well Drilling, Well Testing and Report will serve as the investment tool used for the identification of potential energy conservation and cost saving opportunities available to identify locations that have the highest potential (water temperature of 200 F or higher and 1000 or higher Gallons per Minute (GPM)) for Direct Geothermal applications at the Boise Medical Center.

The VA will not accept any offers that disclaim parts of the required work. 

Relevant facility information that is available will be provided when the RFQ is issued. 

The offeror shall provide all data and analysis, design services and support services for obtaining required permits, training, labor materials, tools, equipment and supervision to accomplish this project. The completion of this project is expected to be between 210 and 365 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.

The work will include the following items but is not limited to: updated analysis of existing data using methods available today which would provide information pertinent to evaluating potential geothermal groundwater source of 200 degree Fahrenheit (F) or higher temperature and flow of 1000 GPM or higher for VA's desired project.

Along with evaluation of existing data, on-site pre-test investigation conducted within the VA Boise site is required to further refine the search and should provide the location(s) of the thermal "hotspots" and fracture zones or other desirable features within the VA Boise site footprint.   

The Contractor shall provide Draft and Final Work Plans for Existing Data evaluation / Pre-Test on-site investigation. These plans shall include a listing of existing data anticipated for review, methods of analysis, pre-test sampling plan stating methods, locations, timeline and overall project from beginning to a successful end.

The Contractor shall provide a report to the VA complete with the results and conclusions from the newly analyzed geophysical data, and the pre test study. This report should accurately pinpoint the areas of high temperature (200 degree F or higher) within aquifer and provide data for the required depth and location of a new geothermal well.  Scope of pre test study should be limited to property within the Boise VAMC boundaries.

Simultaneous with the Draft Pre-Test Study report, the contractor shall compile a Draft Test Well Drilling Plan.  This plan shall specify methods of drilling, equipment required, on-site space requirements (including equipment storage / lay-down yard), anticipated noise levels / noise abatement procedures, hours / days of operation, proposed casing, or other methods of retaining well integrity during drilling / testing operations, methods of temperature testing, methods of groundwater flow testing (including temporary pump installation, methods for disposition of test pump water (disposal or re-introduction), anticipated quantities of groundwater extracted during testing, spoils handling / disposition plan, safety plan,  and any other conditions needing in order to meet all local, state and federal codes and compliance including environmental requirements. 

Note: The Pre Test Study may be a one or a combination of Multi-method approach consisting of Seismic Reflection, Audio-Frequency Magnetotelluric, DC Resistivity, and Gravity Survey as determined most appropriate by the contractor. Provide a comprehensive Explanation the reason/s for the selection of the method you chose / submitted and provide three successful projects using your suggested method. 

Following review of the Pre-Test Study results and discussion, and approval of the Test Well Drilling Plan, it is anticipated that VA will proceed to the next phase - Test Well Drilling, Well Testing and Report. This phase will consist of a single test well drilled to confirm the depth, temperature and flow of the hot water within the aquifer. It is anticipated that this well will be used for the production well. The data gathered from this test well will determine the viability of the proposed production well by using well draw down and recovery rate testing.   

Because this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto so it is in the interest of small businesses to respond to this notice if they feel that they are capable of meeting the requirements of this project.

<p>&emsp;<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY<br />AFNWC/PKOA is responsible for the proposed contracting action. For the purchase of power meters, Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is required. The purchase request number is F2KBAD2013A002.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />The purchase of power meters will be awarded as a new contract and the type of contract planned is firm fixed price.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory needs to acquire three (3) Coherent brand name laser power meters compatible with existing LM-45 HTD Coherent detector heads. Each laser power meter, valued at approximately $1,750.00 must be compatible with AFRL's existing Coherent detector heads. Such detectors have the following specifications:<br />Characteristic Value<br />Input Range, Thermopile Sensors 20 &micro;V to 2V (PM Model)<br />Input Range, Optical Sensors 1 nA to 20 mA<br />Measurement Resolution 0.1% of full-scale<br />Noise, Thermopile Sensors 500 nV (PM Model)<br />Noise, Optical Sensors 4.6 pA<br />Power Sampling Rate 10 Hz<br />Accuracy (Digital Meter) &plusmn;1.0% of reading<br />Accuracy - System Meter accuracy + sensor accuracy<br />Accuracy - Analog Output &plusmn;1.0%<br />Display 112 x 78 mm backlight graphic LCD, 480 x 320 pixels. Adjustable contrast and viewing angle<br />Statistical Analysis Min., max., mean, range, standard deviation, energy dose, and stability. Trend charting, tuning, positional display, and analysis of beam stability.<br />Computer Interface USB and RS-232<br />Analog Output 0 to 1, 2, or 4 VDC (selectable)<br />Analog Output Update Rate Up to 1,000 Hz for pyroelectric; 10 Hz for thermopile and optical<br />Instrument Power 90 to 260 VAC, 50/60 Hz AC power adapter (incl.)<br />Battery Life 8800 mAH Li-ion battery<br />Temperature (Operating) 5&deg;C to 40&deg;C (41&deg;F to 104&deg;F)<br />Temperature (Storage) 20&deg;C to 70&deg;C (-4&deg;F to 158&deg;F)</p>
<p><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 USC 2304(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302 (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />Coherent power meters are required in order to be compatible with existing Coherent detector heads. Such power meters and detector heads will be used to measure laser power in various experiment. The Coherent power meters are highly specialized in that complex electronics and high degrees of measurement accuracy are involved. Therefore, this acquisition will involve the procurement of highly specialized equipment.</p>
<p>Award to any other source would result in substantial, additional, cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition. The reason for this is that the nature of this acquisition requires power meters compatible with existing Coherent detector heads and therefore requires usage of the authority cited above. After doing extensive market research, it has been determined that only Coherent brand name power meters are compatible only with Coherent detector heads due to proprietary electrical connections and information relay. Other manufactures have specifically said that their power meters would not be compatible with Coherent detector heads. To avoid having to buy new detector heads that are compatible with power meters produced by a different company, it is essential that Coherent power meters be procured. To do otherwise, would be more costly to the US Air Force since not only would power meters need to be procured, detector heads would be as well. The acquisition of new (other than Coherent) detector heads is estimated to cost the Government in excess of $2000.</p>
<p>Therefore, only Coherent is capable of providing power meters without the US Air Force experiencing substantial additional cost.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br />Extensive market research was performed with several manufacturers; Agilent, Gentec-EO, Newport, Ophir, Thor Labs and Coherent. The manufacturers other than Coherent specifically stated that their power meters were not compatible with Coherent detector heads. After performing such market research, it was determined that the procurement of Coherent power meters was the most economic option.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND RESONABLE<br />The contracting officer will determine that the anticipated costs are fair and reasonable IAW FAR Subpart 13.106-3 -- Award and Documentation. Applicable price analysis will be performed.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED<br />As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by soliciting information and quotes from potential vendors. It was determined that no other business entities besides Coherent will be able to provide a product that is compatible with already existing Coherent detector heads. Each potential vendor contacted regarding this solicitation explained the proprietary detector head information would prevent their laser power module from interfacing with AFRL's preexisting Coherent detector heads.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF THER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />None</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br />All sources contacted during the market research phase were unable to meet the requirement since the power meters that they sold were incompatible with Coherent detector heads. See sources and market research in outlined in section V.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br />No actions are planned to foster competition for future acquisitions since to do so would require the development of new power meter technology, apart from the Coherent meter, that is compatible with Coherent detector heads. This action would be costly to the government.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-12(b)).</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)The Bureau of Reclamation Pacific Northwest Region, Snake River Area Office, Middle Snake Field Office, Cascade Field Station, Cascade, Idaho (Reclamation) is soliciting for small business contractor interest, comment, and capability statements pertaining to performing Fire Management Fuels Reduction Services around Lake Cascade near Cascade, ID. The North American Classification System - NAICS Code 115310 - Support Activity for Forestry.  The work contemplated would involve thinning approximately 300 acres of timber lands over a period of three (3) to five (5) years.  The work to be performed would be restricted to a September - November timeframe and would require manual labor/machinery efforts due to the steep and rugged terrain.  Due to the terrain and the close proximity of homes there will be no slash burning conducted.  All slash will need to be chipped and removed from the area. The species of trees to be thinned are predominantly Ponderosa pine.  Most of these trees are second growth and are located in "Doghair" thickets.   The work proposed would be a goods for services basis where the market value of the firewood, saw logs, post and poles, and wood chips (Goods) would be equal consideration for thinning, restoration and clean up (Services) or if applicable, result in a cost sharing of proceeds.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Med Associates   P.O. Box 319 St. Albans VT 05478. National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland .  The lab has the need for several types of rodent (rats and mice) behavioral chambers for their research into the mechanism of addiction.   These chambers will be used to train animals to perform reward-learning experiments (i.e. cocaine self-administration). All chambers require end users to be fluent in its unique programming language.  Operant chambers will not function properly without extensive knowledge of the systems proprietary programming language.  The laboratory has over 5 years of experience with Med Associate equipment and within this period, we have developed the expertise and a unique set of programs that we routinely use in our research protocols.  In addition, because we will need to sync many of the behavioral outputs with other third-party equipments (i.e. lasers, electrophysiological recording), we know that Med Associates will be able to custom build adapters that will enable us to perform these intricate experiments.   Lastly, over 80% of behavioral research laboratories (including labs at the NIDA IRP) use Med Associate equipment, there is a substantial knowledge base that we can access.  This extensive network of Med Associate users will be of great help should we encounter any problems.  For these compelling reasons, the Med Associates system is the only one that will meet our strict needs and the NIDA IRP must establish a sole source agreement with Med Associates.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION: <br /></strong></span>This announcement describes a revolutionary research program, "Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning" to be launched under the ONRBAA12-001, Long Range Broad Agency Announcement for Navy and Marine Corps Science and Technology which can be found at http://www.onr.navy.mil/Contracts-Grants/Funding-Opportunities/Broad-Agency-Announcements.aspx. The research opportunity described in this announcement specifically falls under numbered paragraphs 5 of the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare &amp; Combating Terrorism Department (Code 30) sub section and 1 of the Warfighter Performance Human and Bioengineered Systems (Code 34) subsection. The submission of proposals, their evaluation and the placement of basic research contracts and grants will be carried out as described in that Broad Agency Announcement. <br />The purpose of this announcement is to focus the attention of the scientific community on (1) the area to be studied, and (2) the planned timetable for the submission of white papers and full proposals. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. TOPIC DESCRIPTION: <br /></span></strong>Research in human pattern recognition and decision-making suggest that there is a "sixth sense" through which humans can detect and act on unique patterns without consciously and intentionally analyzing them. Evidence is accumulating that this capability, known as intuition or intuitive decision making, enables the rapid detection of patterns in ambiguous, uncertain and time restricted information contexts, that it informs the decision making process and, most importantly, that it may not require domain expertise to be effective. These properties make intuition a strong candidate for further exploration as the basis for developing a new set of decision support training technologies.<br />The proposed topic will lead to new insights into intuitive decision making, and develop new approaches for enhancing this process. The proposed topic will do this by: <br />&bull; Characterizing the nature of intuition at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels in order to develop approaches to train &amp; measure it<br />&bull; Developing a computational cognitive model of intuition, in order to facilitate the delivery of scenario based training to enhance intuitive decision making<br />&bull; Demonstrating that implicit learning techniques, guided by these models and embedded in a scenario based training technology, can enhance intuitive decision making in non-experts, in order to increase baseline abilities to make more effective decisions under conditions in which information is ambiguous, and time to analyze is restricted <br />The program will pursue a wide variety of approaches that address four challenges that are key to understanding and enhancing intuitive decision making: 1) Combining advances in measuring performance at multiple representation levels (e.g, neural, cognitive &amp; behavioral) with advances in simulation - based paradigms for assessing decision making to understand the foundations of intuitive decision making; 2) Leveraging advances in cognitive modeling and machine learning techniques to represent individual intuitive decision making processes; 3) Developing an implicit learning based approach for enhancing intuitive decision making; and, 4) Combining these efforts, through scenario/simulation based training, to test and validate the hypothesis that implicit learning can enhance intuitive decision making for one or more operationally valid tasks.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background: <br /></span>This topic outlines four challenges that must be addressed in order to develop training technologies for intuitive decision making. First, the nature of intuitive decision making must be characterized, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels. Second, these characterizations must be integrated into a single model, providing the foundation for developing adaptive and individualized training technologies. Third, implicit learning based paradigms for enhancing intuitive decision making must be developed. Fourth, the resultant measures, models and learning approach must be implemented into a training technology that demonstrably enhances an individual warfighters' intuitive decision making capabilities.<br />"In hindsight, some of the soldiers acknowledge their "spidey sense" was tingling. It was quiet that day. Possibly too quiet, as the platoon motored through ..." - The Star.com "Story of Company C." September 30, 2006 Mitch Potter, Middle East Bureau. http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/106992<br />"... Thanks to the awareness and quick actions of a 99th Regional Readiness Command (RRC) Soldier, however, no one was seriously injured by the [IED] attack--and he did this all while communicating with his wife on a cell phone..." - Soldier's intuition and situational awareness a lifesaver in Iraq.(UPDATE ON Operation Iraqi Freedom)Publication: Army Reserve Magazine Publication Date: 22-MAR-07Author: Coleman, Chris <br />Today's military missions pose complex time-constrained challenges, such as detecting IED emplacements while in a moving vehicle or detecting anomalous civilian behaviors indicative of impending danger. These challenges are compounded by recent doctrinal requirements that require less-experienced Warfighters to make ever-more complex decisions. Current understanding of decision making, which is based on concepts developed around theories of analytic decision making (Newell and Simon, 1972), cannot effectively address these new challenges since they are based on the notion of enabling experts to apply their expertise to addressing new problems. <br />Yet, there are actually two types of recognized decision making processes, analytical and intuitive which appear to be mediated by different processes or systems (Ross et al, 2004; Evans, 2008; Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Analytical decision making is mediated by processes that reflect a sequential, step-by-step, methodical, and time consuming process. In contrast, intuitive decision making relies upon a more holistic approach to processing information. Importantly, intuitive decision making can support analytic decision making processing to continue accounting for prospective outcomes as the external problem space changes (Evans, 2008). Intuition is a rapid, non-conscious, cue to the existence of meaningful information detected through one or more sensory modalities (Luu et al, 2010). Intuition permits information extracted by automatic sensory processes, which operate on the time scale of 100's of milliseconds, to be organized by pre-existing (top-down) knowledge. This unconscious organization of incoming information may elicit a feeling or impression of a solution (Luu et al, 2010), which precedes insight or a sudden awareness of the solution. Recent studies suggest that these systems can also be distinguished on the basis of the neural structures that facilitate their actions (Lieberman, 2000, 2007; Volz, 2008; Luu, 2010). <br />According to Bowers et al. (1990) intuition can guide the judgment process by assisting with the discovery of plausible solutions from which to choose. This characterization of intuition, and many others that follow from it, assumes a high level of familiarity with the information being detected. In fact, until recently, intuitive decision making was assumed to require significant domain expertise (Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Yet a growing body of results ranging from the biological (mainly, neural) to the cognitive (Lieberman, 2000; Jung-Beeman et al., 2004; Luu et al 2010) suggests that pre-existing expertise, which requires years of practice to attain (Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1980; Ericsson et al, 1993) may not be a key requirement for intuitive decision making processes. These studies, and others, suggest that intuitive decision making processes share some of the same underlying neural structures and cognitive processes as a type of learning known as implicit learning (Frensch, 2003; Lieberman, 2000, 20007; Kaufman et al, 2010). Consequently, by acquiring domain knowledge through implicit learning, one may be able to automatically strengthen, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels, the same capabilities that are needed for effective intuitive decision making.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives: <br /></span>The objective of this proposed topic is to build a deeper understanding of the neural, cognitive and behavioral processes underlying intuitive decision making, in order to train non-experts to be more effective decision makers. The expected outcomes of this project will include a characterization of how intuition works; a computational model representing these findings; and, training techniques &amp; technologies that enhance intuitive decision making performance. It is expected that these results will lay a scientific foundation for understanding intuitive decision making that will support Cyberwarfare, Unmanned System Operators, Information Analysts, Small Unit Leaders and other domains that require individuals to process and make sense of large volumes of information in time constrained or information-degraded conditions. As well, this effort will establish a technical basis from which to develop new classes of applications that support selection, training, decision aiding and interface design. The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will provide the right blend of incentive, risk and benefit to revolutionize the state of the art in improving decision making. Successful proposals will focus on developing innovative, scalable, and affordable technologies that blend the best measurement technologies and modeling approaches with scenario/simulation based training solutions to enable cost effective dissemination of these technologies to a wide range of users.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Areas: <br /></span>The primary hypothesis underlying this topic is that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. Testing this hypothesis requires advances in specific research areas that include: <br />1) Characterizing intuitive decision making and implicit learning across neural, cognitive and behavioral levels of representation. There is a range of measurement techniques available to do this. It is expected that proposers to this effort will leverage and extend these wherever possible, to ensure that the resultant data are of sufficient quality to develop effective models; <br />2) Representing intuitive decision making through cognitive models in order to guide implicit learning techniques. Based in large part on advances in understanding of the human brain AND advances in machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop representations of cognition that can represent individual differences, adapt to new contexts and information and that can be modified based on other physiological features like stress and fatigue (Mitchell et al 2004; Shinkareva et al 2008). These new techniques enable a greater ability to represent an individual's current &lsquo;state' and forecast future &lsquo;states' in order to anticipate and tailor to the individual's specific needs; <br />3) Applying simulation / scenario based techniques to develop implicit learning approaches that enhance intuitive decision making. Simulation based training provides a flexible environment for both delivering training and for collecting a range of performance measures (OSer et al, 1999). The scenario based training approach provides a validated process for identifying training requirements, developing the scenario(s) to support these requirements and establishing metrics and techniques for analyzing and assessing trainee performance. There are numerous training simulations available that represent domains in which effective intuitive decision making is critical (e.g. IED detection; Social interaction training; Intelligence analysis; etc) and it is expected that existing systems will be leveraged and extended rather than new ones being developed for this effort;<br />4) Testing and validating the hypothesis that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. This includes comparing neural, cognitive and behavioral performance measures across different conditions. Successful validation plans will include approaches capable of demonstrating that: the neural structures that are active during implicit learning are also active during intuition; that in the absence of implicit learning there are different / distinct patterns of neural activity during an intuitive decision making task; that in control tasks in which neither implicit learning was provided or intuitive decision making required, these structures are minimally active; and, that under those conditions in which implicit learning was provided and intuitive decision making was present, there is a significant improvement in decision making compared to other conditions - for example, as represented by a receiver operator characteristic curve. Specific measures and assessment approaches are left to the proposer but must include approaches that will cut across multiple representation levels and provide a means for distinguishing the effects of implicit learning on intuitive making, if such are present, from other conditions. <br />The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will proceed as a four year effort encompassing the above research areas. It is anticipated that addressing each of these research areas will require a multi-year effort to complete and that performance on each research area may overlap in time. Teaming is encouraged within and across research areas. Decomposing each research area into subareas (e.g, breaking up research area 1 into a neural, a cognitive and a behavioral task), each of which is covered by different team members is acceptable if reasonably justified and supported by a clear management / team coordination plan.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">III. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION <br /></span></strong>White papers should not exceed 6 single-sided pages, exclusive of cover page and resume of principal investigator, and should be in 12-point Times New Roman font with margins not less than one inch. The cover page should be labeled "White Paper for BASIC RESEARCH CHALLENGE - ENHANCING INTUITIVE DECISION MAKING THROUGH IMPLICIT LEARNING" and include the following information: title of the proposed effort, technical point of contact, telephone number, fax numbers, and e-mail address. The 4-page body of the white paper should include the following information: (1) Principal Investigator; (2) Relevance of the proposed effort to the research areas described in Section II; (3) Technical objective of the proposed effort; (4) Technical approach that will be pursued to meet the objective; (5) A summary of recent relevant technical breakthroughs; and (6) A program management plan that includes a high level timeline for proposed tasks, indicates proposed team members who will be accomplishing those tasks and a funding plan showing requested funding per fiscal year. A resume of the principal investigator, not to exceed 1 page, should also be included after the 6-page body of the white paper. <br />White papers are required for all offerors seeking funding. Each white paper will be evaluated by the Government to determine whether the technology advancement proposed appears to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy. Only the authors of white papers that appear to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy will be invited to submit full proposals. Initial Government evaluations and feedback will be issued via e-mail notification from the Technical Points of Contact. <br />Detailed Full Proposal (Technical and Cost volumes) will be subsequently encouraged from those offerors whose proposed technologies have been identified through the above referenced e-mail as being of "particular value" to the Government. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. <br />For white papers that propose efforts that are considered of particular value to the Navy but either exceed available budgets or contain certain tasks or applications that are not desired by the Navy, ONR may suggest a full proposal with reduced effort to fit within expected available budgets or an effort that refocuses the tasks or application of the technology to maximize the benefit to the Navy. <br />White papers should be submitted electronically to the business point of contact whose e-mail address appears at the end of this Special Notice. These white papers shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format. <br />To ensure full, timely consideration for funding, white papers should be submitted no later than 15 March 2012. White Papers received after that date will be considered as time and availability of funding permit.<br />The planned date for completing the review of white papers is on or about 15 April 2012. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IV. FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND AWARD INFORMATION <br /></span></strong>Full proposals (including one technical volume and one cost volume) should be submitted under ONR BAA 12-001 by 15 May 2012. Full Proposals received after that date will be considered as time and availability of funding permit.<br />ONR anticipates that both grants and contracts will be issued for this effort. Proposals for contracts should be submitted in accordance with the instructions at Section IV, Application and Submission Information, item 2.b., Full Proposals. Full proposals for grants should be submitted in accordance with the instructions at Section IV., Application and Submission Information, item 5., Submission of Grant Proposals thorough Grants.gov. All full proposals for grants must be submitted through www.grants.gov. All attachments to the application should also include this information to ensure the proposal and its attachments are received by the appropriate Program Office. http://www.grants.gov. The following information must be completed as follows in the SF 424 to ensure that the application is directed to the correct individual for review: Block 4a, Federal Identifier: enter N00014; Block 4b, Agency Routing Number: Enter the Program Office Code (30) and the Business Point of Contact's name, last name first, in brackets. All full proposals for grants must be submitted through Grants.gov website located at http://www.grants.gov/.<br />Total funds available for this effort are approximately $3.85M, roughly broken down across the research areas as follows: <br />&bull; Characterizing intuitive decision making and implicit learning across neural, cognitive and behavioral levels of representation - $1.45M; <br />&bull; Representing intuitive decision making through computational cognitive models in order to guide implicit learning techniques - $1.40M;<br />&bull; Applying simulation / scenario based techniques to develop implicit learning approaches that enhance intuitive decision making and testing and validating the hypothesis that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making - $1.00M<br />The anticipated period of performance for Phase 1 is two years, for Phase 2 the anticipated period of performance is 1 year. Funding decisions are anticipated to be made by 15 June 2012. Projects will have an estimated contract or grant award date of 1 November 2012. Although ONR expects the above described program plan to be executed, ONR reserve the right to make changes.</p>

<DESC>14 March 2012, Dahla Dam "Industry Day" Conference Invitation<br>                            Winchester, VA at the Quality Inn<br><br>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Transatlantic Engineer District - South (TAS) is preparing for construction of Dahla Dam Rehabilitation Project near Kandahar City, Afghanistan later this summer.  TAS is seeking potentially interested bidders to and attend a pre-bid "Industry Day" conference in Winchester, Virginia, USA, on 14 March 2012 at the Quality Inn, 1017 Millwood Pike, Winchester, VA 22602, 540-545-8121 to meet the design and construction project delivery team, learn more about the project, ask questions, and provide feedback to USACE on the constructability of the project.  The draft plans and specifications can be downloaded from https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=2db9b4923815460f8c87d111b19e864c&tab=core&tabmode=list&= for review.<br><br>Dahla Dam is ISAF's Number 1 project and will restore reservoir capacity for needed irrigation that has been lost over the past 60 years due to sedimentation.  The project will be funded by the Fiscal Year 12 Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund; however, funding for construction is not yet available.  The optional additional 3-meter dam raise will be funded by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).  These funds have also not been received.<br><br>Points of Contact<br>Mamie S. Brouwer:  540-667-6474 or mamie.s.brouwer@usace.army.mil<br>Karen E. Rippey:  540-722-6595 or karen.e.rippey@usace.army.mil<br><br>Project Scope<br>The Dahla Dam Improvement Project (project) would raise Dahla Dam, which is located on the Arghandab River approximately 30 kilometers northeast of Kandahar City, Afghanistan's second largest urban center. The project would increase reservoir storage for irrigation in the Arghandab Valley and future municipal water supply for Kandahar City. The project design includes a 5-meter base dam raise and an additional 3-meter dam raise as an option. The construction project scope will include the features listed below.<br><br> The 5-meter base dam raise project<br> <br>1.	Main Embankment Raise: The existing main embankment of the dam would be raised five meters to a crest elevation of 1,145.4 meters. <br>2.	Saddle Dam Raises: The six existing saddle dams would be raised five meters to a crest elevation of 1,145.4 meters. <br>3.	Spillway Modifications: The two existing spillway crests would be raised five meters to a crest elevation of 1,140.4 meters, and their widths would be modified as required to pass the inflow design flood for the raised dam.<br>4.	Outlet Works Modifications: The outlet works components would be modified as required to function with the raised dam. <br> 	The intake tower would be raised to a height that would accommodate the 8-meter dam raise. This would allow for an additional 3-meter dam raise in the future without the need for raising the intake tower further. <br> 	The valve house would be relocated to a point downstream that would accommodate the 8-meter dam raise. This would allow for an additional 3-meter dam raise in the future without the need for relocating the valve house again. <br> 	The mechanical and electrical systems, including all control valves and the station hydropower unit, would be replaced. <br><br>5. Road Realignment: Route Bear would be realigned at an elevation above the normal maximum pool level of the reservoir for the 8-meter dam raise. This would allow for an additional 3-meter dam raise in the future without the need for realigning the road again. <br><br> The 8-meter option dam raise project<br> <br>1.	Main Embankment Raise: The existing main embankment of the dam would be raised eight meters to a crest elevation of 1,148.4 meters. <br>2.	Saddle Dam Raises: The six existing saddle dams would be raised eight meters to a crest elevation of 1,148.4 meters. <br>3.	Spillway Modifications: The two existing spillway crests would be raised eight meters to a crest elevation of 1,143.4 meters, and their widths would be modified as required to pass the inflow design flood for the raised dam. <br>

<DESC>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) is assisting the Social Security Administration explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process. This requires assessment of individuals' functional abilities across a variety of domains (such as movement and physical activities, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and applied cognition) in relationship to functional demands in the workplace and features of the workplace, home, and community environments. Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.
<p>To meet this objective, NIH-RMD, in conjunction with the contractor, will develop Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) instruments utilizing Item Response Theory (IRT) to assess a spectrum of human functioning domains. CAT represents a simple form of artificial intelligence software requiring computer technology for administration. The demonstrated advantages of the CAT instruments compared to more traditional testing methods are: reduced respondent burden, increased score precision, elimination of ceiling and floor effects, client-specific confidence intervals, monitoring of data quality in real time, and lower data collection costs. Because functional outcomes have been shown to have a clear hierarchical structure, gains in precision and efficiency of score estimation are superior to traditional fixed forms of functional assessment, thus transforming the ways in which outcomes can be monitored.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) instruments, based on Item Response Theory (IRT) that will assess major domains of functioning relevant to work. To better support the SSA's evaluation process, distinct claimant and provider CAT instruments are planned in the relevant functional domains. In collaboration with the NIH, the contractor will plan, develop and test claimant and provider IRT-based assessments for each functional domain identified that may result in a CAT instrument. The instruments must be designed to assess critical aspects of the disability evaluation process, including job related functional requirements and the workplace environment. The instruments must be comparable with current instruments presently in development. The contractor will be expected to develop comprehensive item pools for each functional domain identified for development, conduct a calibration study of each item pool, and validate resulting CAT instruments. The contractor will be responsible for creating and testing data collection software platforms; and, developing a full systems integration strategy that includes instrument deployment and testing in the SSA computing environment.</p>
<p>CAT tool development will require a calibration study for each instrument.

<p>(vi) <strong>Background<br /></strong>The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of NIAMS provides a unique contribution to the overall NIAMS research agenda. The IRP has established a tradition of excellence, with a strong focus on long-term, high-risk research, investigations into the genetics and pathophysiology of human disease, and the development of innovative therapies for a number of serious disorders for which satisfactory treatments previously did not exist.</p>
<p>The program is firmly grounded on a foundation of world-class basic science research and technology within the NIAMS IRP itself, widespread collaborations with other outstanding intramural clinicians and scientists on the Bethesda campus, and immediate proximity to the largest clinical research hospital in the world. The result is a heady cocktail of cutting-edge laboratory research in immunology, inflammation, genetics, structural biology, developmental biology, biophysics, and cartilage biology, with a generous twist of translational investigation in a number of clinical specialties.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The reagents are required for the mouse genotyping core for the NIAMS IRP. The core utilizes QIAGEN robots to genotype several hundreds of genetically-modified mice and rats per week. The robots require specific QIAGEN pasticware and reagents; aerosol-free tips, plates, and tubes are made specifically for these instruments as they fit the particular set up of these robots.</p>

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT (Listed Below).

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
 Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein. 

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a) The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes. 

(i) CAPABILITY TO PERFORM 
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE 
(iii) PRICE 

(b) Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii). In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors. Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
 

(c) By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract. The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
 

(d) Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance. Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site). Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
 Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor s past performance.

SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor s past performance.

MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor s past performance.


(f) A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
 Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Technical factors and past performance are more important than price in determining Best Value. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>The Government intends to award without discussions. Therefore, each vendor is urged to examine this request for proposal in its entirety and to ensure that their proposal contains all necessary information, provides all required documentation, and is complete in all aspects.</p>
<p>To aid in evaluation, written portions of the proposals shall be clearly and concisely written as well as being neat, and logically assembled. Proposals shall be typed single sided pages, no less than 12-point (pitch) type.</p>
<p>Proposals submitted against this request shall consist of three separate parts as follows:</p>
<p>a) The first part shall be the price proposal. <br />The SBA anticipates committing approximately $150 million in leverage prior to 2012 fiscal year end (September 30, 2012) under the initial solicitation for Early Stage SBICs. However, SBICs approved under the initial solicitation may request leverage in excess of such amount; if so, the additional amounts requested by such applicants may be committed in subsequent fiscal years. SBA contemplates between three and eight funds will be approved under the initial solicitation although significantly more may apply. Each approved fund is expected to have between two and three principals. SBA estimates up to 50 principals may need to be reviewed under the initial solicitation. Each offeror should submit a minimum total price based upon the parameters included above. Additionally, each offeror should submit a pre manager price in the event the government elects to add additional managers or seeks to reduce the number of managers if the quoted minimum exceeds budgetary constraints. There is no page limitation on this part.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall submit a travel estimate. SBA anticipates between two and four visits to SBA at its Washington headquarters. One visit may extend for a total of three days; other trips are not expected to require more than one day. Travel estimates must comply with the Federal Travel Regulation, 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapters 300-304, and, to the extent applicable, SBA Standard Operating Procedure 20 11 5B.</p>
<p>Pricing Sheet - Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs with line item prices inserted by the offeror. Please refer to the "Pricing Sheet" attached.</p>
<p>Completed and signed Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors shall be included with the price proposal (FAR 52.212-3 - Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items). Also complete and include FAR 52.209-7 entitled, "Information Regarding Responsibility Matters" found within the body of this announcement.</p>
<p>b) The second part of the proposal shall address the technical approach. <br />This part shall address the Contractor's ability to analyze the capability of fund managers to successfully invest in early stage companies, primarily in the form of equity securities. The contractor shall demonstrate an understanding of how fund managers source potential investments, perform due diligence on such potential investments, structure and price the investment, add value to the businesses invested in, and plan for and execute an exit from the investment. The contractor's experience should have been obtained by investing directly in funds with a strategy similar to that envisioned by the Early Stage SBIC program or by advising investors making investments in such funds. This part shall be limited to 25 pages and should include the following elements:</p>
<p>i) Technical Approach<br />Under the Early Stage SBIC program, the Agency will be selecting management teams to operate as Early Stage SBICs. These SBICs will focus on investing (primarily equity) in early stage companies. The selected contractor will assist the Agency in evaluating the potential applicants for the program. This evaluation will focus on the skills and experiences of the proposed SBIC managers to determine if they can successfully invest in early stage companies. The selected contractor will review the previous experience (especially track record of the managers), the proposed strategy of the management team and conduct appropriate due diligence on the applicant(s). Based on this evaluation the selected contractor will provide recommendations to the Agency as to the qualifications of the applicant. In order to perform this analysis, the selected contractor will have had to have prior experience in either (1) making such investments directly into small businesses or into funds that make such investments or (2) having evaluated such an investment strategy on behalf of potential investors into a fund that would make early stage investments. <br />It is likely that the time frame for evaluating potential applicants will be compressed, perhaps as little as 30-45 days from submission of the applications. The contractor must be able to assign qualified staff sufficient to meet this deadline. The contractor needs to address the methodology it will use in evaluating the skill set and experiences of prospective applicants. It should demonstrate how the methodology allows it to determine that potential applicants will possess the skills necessary to be successful in the Early Stage SBIC program. Specifically, the contractor should explain how its methodology addresses the areas contained in the Investment Memorandum attached to the Statement of Work. The contractor should directly relate prior experience it possesses to the analysis required to be performed herein. <br />ii) Key Personnel <br />The contractor must supply resumes of the individuals performing the analysis required under this contract. The resumes must detail the specific type and amount of work experience held by the key individuals who will be involved in this project and how such experience relates to the duties required under this contract. The proposed individuals must have the specific experience and must provide the actual analysis; they cannot function in solely an oversight role. The expectation is that the primary individual(s) responsible for the analysis will have a minimum of five years of directly analogous experience although supporting professional individuals may have less. Nonetheless, all individuals performing the analysis contemplated by this contract must have directly analogous experience. <br />iii) Organizational Experience/Ability to Perform<br />The contractor must demonstrate that it has the infrastructure to satisfactorily perform and support the analysis contemplated by this contract. This will include the ability to supply the administrative services necessary to support the contract. The contractor must address whether performance of the duties required herein will be compromised by its existing business needs. <br />c) The third part shall address past performance.<br />Contractor shall address past performance gained over a minimum of the past five years that demonstrates experience outlined in b) above. The contractor should have the experience directly or have assigned staff that has the direct experience for the requisite number of years. There is no page limitation on this part. A minimum of three reference packages entitled "PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONAIRE" found behind this solicitation must be submitted. The offeror is responsible for submitting Part I of the package but is also responsible for coordinating with their chosen references to ensure a full package is received by the SBA consisting of all six pages for each reference.</p>
<p>Six paper sets of the proposal, an original so marked and five copies are required. Submissions must be submitted in hard copy form.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br />Evaluation of Proposals<br />A. Initial Evaluation of Proposals</p>
<p>An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth in the Evaluation Criteria stated below, and all offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the established evaluation plan. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussion based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If required, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of the technically acceptable proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amount the most highly rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.</p>
<p>B. Discussion/Final Proposal Revisions (if appropriate/necessary)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of the discussions, a final common cut-off date which allows a reasonable opportunity for submission of written final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors selected to remain in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>C. Final Evaluation of Offers (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revision</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Under the Early Stage SBIC program, the Agency will be selecting management teams to operate as Early Stage SBICs. These SBICs will focus on investing (primarily equity) in early stage companies. The selected contractor will assist the Agency in evaluating the potential applicants for the program. This evaluation will focus on the skills and experiences of the proposed SBIC managers to determine if they can successful invest in early stage companies. The selected contractor will review the previous experience (especially track record of the managers), the proposed strategy of the management team and conduct appropriate due diligence on the applicant(s). Based on this evaluation the selected contractor will provide recommendations to the Agency as to the qualifications of the applicant. In order to perform this analysis, the selected contractor will have had to have prior experience in either (1) making such investments directly into small businesses or into funds that make such investments or (2) having evaluated such an investment strategy on behalf of potential investors into a fund that would make early stage investments. The contractor must specifically identify how its methodology determines that a prospective applicant meets (or fails to meet) the criteria contained in the Investment Memorandum attached to the Statement of Work. <br />It is likely that the time frame for evaluating potential applicants will be compressed, perhaps as little as 30-45 days from submission of the applications. The contractor must be able to assign qualified staff sufficient to meet this deadline. <br /><br />Key Personnel <br />The ability of the contractor to perform under this proposal is directly related to the skills and quality of the personnel assigned to the project. Failure of the assigned personnel to have directly analogous experience will be a disqualifying characteristic. The contractor must supply resumes of the individuals performing the analysis required under this contract. The resumes must detail the specific type and amount of work experience held by the key individuals who will be involved in this project and how such experience relates to the duties required under this contract. The proposed individuals must have the specific experience and must provide the actual analysis; they cannot function in solely an oversight role. The expectation is that the primary individual(s) responsible for the analysis will have a minimum of five years of directly analogous experience although supporting professional individuals may have less. Nonetheless, all individuals performing the analysis contemplated by this contract must have directly analogous experience.</p>
<p>Organizational Experience/Ability to Perform<br />The contractor must demonstrate that it has the infrastructure to satisfactorily perform and support the analysis contemplated by this contract. This will include the ability to supply the administrative services necessary to support the contract and that performance under this contract will not be compromised by its existing business.</p>
<p>Past Performance <br />Evaluation of this factor will be based upon references provided by the contractor. These references will be contacted. The Government may also consider other information available, including personal knowledge. The dates of the prior performance and the relevance of the work performed will be considered. Performance information will be used to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to project requirements, including the quality of services and products, effectiveness of cost management/control, timeliness of performance, and customer satisfaction will be evaluated. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Price<br />The contractor will be selected upon a determination by the Agency that it is the best qualified to perform the analysis contemplated under the contract and that also meets the pricing constraints of the Agency. <br />Before the offeror's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Huntington District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for stone, gravel, and other materials to be delivered to Summersville Lake, Summersville, WV.  Please see attached document.  This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses.<br><br>If the vendors are experiencing certificate problems provide them with the<br>following:<br><br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the<br>forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).<br>ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may<br>have noticed an IE alert stating our ASFI root certificate was not issued by<br>a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br><br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br><br>

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL
<p>1.1 SCOPE</p>
<p>The National Strike Force (NSF) requires contract support services to provide incident response safety training. The Contractor will provide a bid for one (1) year and four (4) optional years.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), is the federal government's blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The NCP is the result of our country's efforts to develop a national response capability and promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans. The NCP includes a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges, in addition to releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>Within the NCP, the NSF Strike Teams (NSFST) are designated as Special Teams required to maintain the standing ability to support Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) for any discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil into a navigable waterway of the U.S., or a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment of the U.S.</p>
<p>The NSF is responsible for ensuring that each Coast Guard Strike Team member has the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities needed to safely perform the NSF missions. A critical aspect of the Strike Team's mission is to respond safely to hazardous material incidents. As part of that mission, it is crucial for Strike Team personnel to organize essential information into site-specific safety plans and understand the decision-making associated with hazardous waste operations and emergency response safety programs. This training is essential to ensure Strike Team members understand the regulatory requirements for safety and are prepared to respond to hazardous material or hazardous waste incidents as safely as possible.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br />DATED: JANUARY 19, 2012</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The Government has a requirement for a sole source task order for Main Propulsion auxiliary support equipment from MTU/DaimlerChrysler. In preparation to meet the training requirements to support the new USCG Fast Response Cutter (FRC), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) desires to purchase an auxiliary support equipment to run the previously procured training version of the MTU Main Diesel Engine (MDE), and the propulsion control system as installed on the FRC. These auxiliary equipments will be used in the training that directly supports maintenance and operations of the installed main diesel engines and on Coast Guard WPC class cutters. The training aid and components will be delivered to USCG Training Center (TRACEN) Yorktown, VA.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting for the MTU components on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-512) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's Engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train maintainers and operators of this equipment. A significant T-ew facilities renovation is planned to start in the next 12 months including the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create a Land-Based Training Facility (LBTF). This auxiliary support equipment procured by this task order shall be stored at the LBTF.</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. This solicitation requires offerors of such products to submit all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to enable the government to determine whether the alternate product is either identical to or physically, mechanically, electronically, and functionally interchangeable with the product specified. This statement warns offerors that the failure to furnish all necessary information may preclude consideration of the offer, stating that the alternate product will be considered technically unacceptable, if acceptability cannot be determined before award. Newly-manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. All parts shall be NEW approved parts. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Required delivery is 365 days after contract award. Deliver to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg 63, Elizabeth City, NC. FOB Point - Destination.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page eleven (11) of this solicitation.</p>
<p>A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI USPSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. The Program Operations Advisor position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires a Program Operations Advisor who has the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs. The Program Operations Advisor provides services which require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and operational expertise in administrative support. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The Program Operations Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee which may be the Deputy Chief of OMD or other OMD Team Leaders, the Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD) or FPD Regional Team Leaders. The Program Operations Advisor will spend the majority of his or her time working with OMD support staff in Washington. All of the field activities supported and the vast majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Program Operations Advisor to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI).</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Program Operations Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Operations Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Operations Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Operations Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Operations Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide general administrative support for the supervisor and program-funded staff such as: scheduling and facilitating meetings; drafting meeting minutes; tracking and ensuring action items are followed up; scheduling and meeting logistics preparation; filing; correspondence control; and other administrative services as required;</p>

<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Fill ad hoc critical administrative/operations support staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field, in support of program funded staff and program operations, in areas such as administrative support (e.g. records management, correspondence control, logistics assistance, other general administrative support), personnel and human resources support (e.g. payroll, awards, drafting personnel memos, etc.), information and technology, and travel and finance support;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, provide ad hoc operations support for new OTI country program start-ups, country program management and close-outs. Provide on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; As required, initiate and maintain effective relationships with institutional contractors, implementing partners, other agencies, and administrative support staff in other USAID offices sharing procedures and systems in order to review good administrative practices, and seek out innovative ways of doing business to improve efficiency and effectiveness;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide knowledge management support such as tracking documents, lessons learned, best practices across OTI programs and/or operations as required. Assist teams in the creation and/or maintenance of information products in support of political transition programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate closely with OTI's two divisions (Operations and Management Division and Field Programs Division) and the Program Office on all issues. Attend the respective team meetings, report out to the supervisor, ensure the supervisor's priorities are shared with other divisions/teams, etc. Backstop other Administrative and Program Assistants on other teams when required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The incumbent will take direction from and will report to the Chief - OTI Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop work objectives, recurring tasks, projects to be accomplished and products to be produced and establish deadlines. The incumbent is then expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above as well as meet the requirements in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1). Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />ii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>

<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55 effective 02 February 2012 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20120130 edition and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) Current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2012-21. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the purchase of EMC SAN hardware/software maintenance for DLA Distribution Information Operations New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work (Attachment 1). The SOW includes a required Bill of Materials.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. Justification to restrict sources is as follows:<br />EMC is the sole manufacturer of the SAN servers which are proprietary in nature. EMC maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. Therefore, maintenance of the brand name servers must be performed by either EMC or an authorized support partner. It is essential that the EMC products utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination). All SAN servers are located at Information Operations at Susquehanna, PA.</p>
<p>Note: The required period of performance for the maintenance is the date of award through October 10, 2012. Prices submitted shall include a reinstatement fee to bring the maintenance current from October 11, 2011 through the date of the award. Estimated date of award is March 12, 2012.</p>

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>The solicitation date and close time has been extended until 12 January 2012 at 4:30pm EST to allow interested offerors the opportunity to inspect Emergency Electric Pumps if they desire.

<p>SYNOPSIS<br />BIRD AIRCRAFT STRIKE HAZARD (BASH) &amp; WILDLIFE CONTROL SERVICES<br />SOLICITATION FA4621-11-R-0004</p>
<p>Synopsis Description Section:</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing announces the projected solicitation for Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) &amp; Wildlife Control Services at McConnell AFB, Kansas 67221.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 100% set-aside to Small Business (SB) concerns on or about 12 September 2011 for the acquisition of BASH &amp; Wildlife Control services to be performed at McConnell AFB KS. All responsible SB concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be evaluated using Price-Performance Trade-Off (PPTO) evaluation factors with performance being significantly more important than price. The Government intends to issue an award to a single SB concern under a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Requirements Type contract on or about 12 November 2011. Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one base period of performance (1 year, 1 February 2012 through 31 January 2013) and may include up to four optional periods of performance (each 1 year in duration, following the Federal Fiscal Year Calendar and running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance). There is no guarantee that any optional periods of performance may be exercised.</p>
<p>The primary emphasis of this program is to prevent bird airstrike hazards. However, the contractor shall provide a comprehensive wildlife control program to mitigate the risk of wildlife at McConnell AFB, KS. Wildlife encountered includes, but is not limited to: birds, foxes, dogs, skunks, snakes, turtles, coyotes, and deer. The program may include, but is not limited to, the use of trained birds of prey, dogs, pyrotechnics, harassment, trapping, relocation, airfield patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring and as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for said services. The successful contractor shall provide all personnel, management, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and all other items necessary (excluding Government Furnished Property). The contractor shall comply with all federal, state, and local regulations in performance of this contract. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561710, Exterminating and Pest Control Service. The Small Business Size Standard is $7,000,000.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the Performance Work Statement, the Department of Labor Wage Determination and the Past and Present Performance Questionnaire, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 12 September 2011, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on CCR and ORCA registrations can be obtained at their respective web sites: http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>No response to this announcement is required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />*****</p>

<DESC>Project work consists of excavating approximately 125,000 cubic yards of material from the Palm Beach Harbor Entrance Channel and adjoining settling basin to alleviate critical shoaling that was discovered during a post-storm survey conducted 30 November 2011.  The Entrance Channel passes through Lake Worth Inlet in Palm Beach County Florida, and is a part of the overall Palm Beach Harbor project.  Due to the hazardous conditions presented by the shoaling to Palm Beach Harbor's commercial shipping traffic, this requirement contains an expedited design and award schedule.  The project will entail the dredging of the entrance from Station 30+00 to Station 56+00 to the authorized 37-foot depth plus an allowable 2-foot overdepth. The settling basin will be dredged to a depth of 35 feet plus an allowable 2-foot overdepth.  Material resulting from this event will be placed in the permitted nearshore disposal area which lies 500 feet south of the inlet.  Incidental work includes endangered species and turbidity monitoring. Period of performance is 43 calendar days.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>Due to system limitations the FAR Authority cited is incorrect. The proper FAR Authority implemented to allow this procurement is FAR 13.106-1(b) (1); Soliciting Competition. This is a modification to the original posting under solicitation # 0010142518. The awarded contract number is W81K00-12-P-0193; to prevent a duplicate posting of this requirement the Government is utilizing the awarded contract number with a letter "A" at the end: W81K00-12-P-0193A. <br><br>Single-use Human tissues; Posterior Tibialis Tendon(9.0 or 9.5mm) must come from a donor age of 60 years or younger, Cancellous Plugs (8mm) must come from a donor of 60 years or younger, and Frozen Gracilis Tendon (5.5 or 6.0 mm) must come from a donor of 60 years or younger.<br><br><br>                             MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD <br>                     FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br>                    UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD<br><br>1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office - West - Hood, Carl R.  <br>   Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC), Fort Hood, TX 76544.<br>2. Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Transplant Tissues needed for non-   routine surgeries.<br>3. Description of Products/Services: Single-use Human tissues; Posterior Tibialis<br>   Tendon (9.0 or 9.5mm) must come from a donor age of 60 years or younger,   <br>   Cancellous Plugs (8mm) must come from a donor of 60 years or younger, and<br>   Frozen Gracilis Tendon (5.5 or 6.0 mm) must come from a donor of 60 years or <br>   Younger. This action will be accomplished through the use of a Firm Fixed Price<br>   Purchase Order.<br>4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), <br>   Soliciting from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified <br>   acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the<br>   contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action <br>   deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing <br>   agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization). <br>5. Reason for Cited Authority: Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center has requested<br>   that we enter into a contract with the LifeNet Transplant Services directly. The<br>   limited availability of the required Tissue for the specific age group and the <br>   specified dimensions and the time frame for delivery cannot be accomplished <br>   before the required delivery date by any other vendor. Therefore Full and Open <br>   Competition need not be provided for.<br>6.
