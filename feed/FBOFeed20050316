<CONTACT>KAREN OHLHAUSER kohlhauser@usgs.gov CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487369     kohlhauser@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for Interpretation of geographic names and other appropriate data from primary and secondary Federal, State, and local maps, and textual material including primary historical documents. The data will be compiled and encoded for the area for the State of Kentucky within the area east of 84 degrees 45'  W  longitude to the State boundary with Virginia and West Virginia. The main thrust of this Phase II work for the State of Kentucky project consists of a systematic search of selected documents in order to identify unrecorded name information and to create new name records to add to those assembled during Phase I. This procedure needs to be completed before a State or territory volume of The National Gazetteer of the United States of America can be published. It is important that each person researching name information for Phase II be able to interpret topographic maps and to relate point, line, and area symbols among maps of different and varyig scales.  Be able to make reliable judgements on feature identification when comparing maps and relating tectual description  to map sysmbols on sketch maps for accurate identification on the modern large-scale topographic maps. An understanding of how people use and apply geographic names to the landscape is useful. Should understand how proper names are applied to symbols by map editors and the limitations inherent in the process. Knowledge of the georaphy and history of the area being worked will greatly improve a researcher's ability to interpret data. Part 1 involves the collection of name data on a master set of work maps. Parts 2 and 3 require the transfer and converstion of both the annotated and printed map data into machine readable form for inclusion into the National Geographic Names Data Base. The Government will provide data entry software developed by the GNIS staff specifically for the program. The NAICS code is 541990. The expected performance period is 48 months from date of award. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. This solicitation will be issued on or about April 1, 2005 and will close at 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time on May 3, 2005.  For a copy of the solicitation (05ERSS0012), please visit www.fedbizops.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  All vendors who wish to submit a proposal must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov.   The planned award date will be on or about June 10, 2005. The point of contact for this procurement is Karen I. Ohlhauser at 703-648-7369 or kohlhauser@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,
(CSAT), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the
Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), Program Support
Center(PSC), plans to award a 12 month sole source contract
using simplified acquisition procedures, to the National
Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA), 11426 
Rockville Pike, Suite 100, Rockville, MD   20852.

The anticipated date of award is April 7, 2005.

The Purpose of this contract will develop consumer-oriented
products as well as use existing materials, such as publications
and videos, and repackage them for use at the congregational
level across denominations.  Topics will include understanding
addiction, and the importance of finding the support and help
for the affected individuals and family members, and to empower
them to initiate and sustain steps toward recovery.  In addition
the initiative will create and conduct a training program for representatives of faith congregations in one designated pilot
city on how to use the materials effectively to provide support, direction and hope to their congregants and other consumers
in their communities.

These materials will be provided directly to members of faith congregations to help support their individual and family
efforts to prevent alcohol and drug problems, to intervene on
them as appropriate, and to find the support they need to
prevent, address or recover from alcohol and drug addiction.

Possible Publications:

1.  Pamphlet or booklet for children and youth:  When a Parent
Drinks Too Much Or Is Using Drugs, What Can I Do?  A simple
guide to understanding addiction, to acknowledging the fear, pain
and confusion it causes, and the importance of finding trusted
adults to help and support him, and where and how to find them.

2.  Posters, flyers, ad slicks, and drop-in articles for publication in both congregational bulletins and community religious press to provide on-going education, encouragement and support to affected individuals and family members to help them recognize the family nature of addiction and to be empowered to initiate and sustain steps toward recovery.

3.  Pamphlet: Helping a Loved One Get Into Treatment and Recovery:  A Family Guide to Intervention – would include information on 12-step programs for family members as well as basic intervention strategies. It would be designed to be complementary to SAMHSA’s new booklet on treatment for family members.

Training Materials:
A Guide for Congregational Leadership Teams on:  How to maximize the packet of materials,

How to motivate congregants – both adults and children – to study and use the materials and what strategies for displaying and promoting the materials would be most effective,

How to provide clear, simple and effective messages to help establish an atmosphere that promotes addressing addiction and supports recovery for the whole family

How to address the issues of spirituality being blocked in the face of addiction in the family and the role of spirituality in recovery, and

How to support a recovering person’s requesting to present his/her fifth step.

Video(s), taken from Recovery Month Webcasts already in existence, which could be included in the packets and recommended for the congregation’s “lending library.”

The contractor shall provide the following but not be limited to:

Provide SAMHSA/CSAT with a contract plan within 15 days of contract award.  After the contract plan, the contractor shall submit status reports for the end of 1st quarter, mid-year, 3rd quarter and final report.  Reports must include work completed, work in progress with completion dates and planned work.  Report must address accomplishments as well as areas of recommendation to increase the success of the contract.

Create proposed publications and materials listed above if approved by the Agency for publication.  All newly created publications must be cleared through the proper HHS/OASPA/SAMHSA/CSAT clearance process.  Printing must be completed through the Government Printing Office.  Pending government final budget, at least one (1) of the
proposed three (3) publications must be produced.
If federal printing dollars are available, all products
could be required.

Design a program (campaign) to distribute packets to congregations across one city and its environs (as a test of their usefulness to the affected consumers), and engage local organizations to participate in the delivery and follow-up. Detroit is suggested as a test site because there is broad and diverse representation of faith and ethnic communities in the metropolitan area, and the contractor has three affiliate organizations and many members active in the substance abuse
treatment and prevention fields in the Detroit metropolitan area who could be an integral part of a distribution project and follow-up support.

Create and conduct a training program for representatives of faith congregations in the designated city on how to use the materials effectively to provide support, direction and hope to their congregants and other consumers in their communities.

Contractor shall work to find additional funds in the local metropolitan area where this project would be initiated and tested. Not only would this increase the number of materials made available to consumers needing help, it would engage local sponsoring organizations and make “buy-in” for sustaining the project more likely.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify
their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days
after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by
the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03,
Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on
301-443-5229.

It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable.  Offerors are authorized to provide information relative to any problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions taken by the offeror.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: 
(703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Secretary of Tenders Committee, National Electric Power Company, P.O. Box 2310, Amman, Jordan 11181, Phone:  (962) 65858615 / (962) 65818336. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a 400kV dual overhead transmission line from Aqaba to Amman, a new Amman East 400/132 kV substation and to extend the existing Aqaba 400 kV substation.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a small, largely land-locked country with a population of approximately 5.6 million.  It has a territory of 92,000 sq. km and common borders with Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority Territory.  Electricity production in Jordan has steadily increased during the past ten years to meet growing power demands; these high growth rates are expected to continue for the next 10 to 15 years.  Jordan has undergone many changes on account of this growth and in 1996 the Government of Jordan formally converted the Jordan Electricity Authority into the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), a state-owned monopoly responsible for the management, operation and development of the country’s high voltage transmission network and load dispatching.  NEPCO is also responsible for Jordan’s interconnections with neighboring countries.  Almost all the electricity currently generated in Jordan is produced by Electricity Generation Companies (GENCOs).  The Zarqa power plant, with a capacity of 400 megawatts (MW), and the Aqaba power plant, with a capacity of 650 MW, are the country's two main power generation facilities.  Electricity demand is growing, and the Jordanian government has been seeking ways to attract foreign capital to fund additional capacity.  Jordan's basic plan for the future of its electric utility system involves having NEPCO maintain ownership of transmission assets, but relying on private power generation and privatizing existing generation assets.  

The existing Jordanian national electrical network is composed of main substations, which are dispersed across the Kingdom to ensure the supply of electrical energy to all consumers.  Jordan is moving toward a pool model for the electricity market and the country is considered a main crossing point for a number of electrical interconnections in the future, including: the seven member electric interconnection project (EIJLLST), which aims to connect the electrical networks of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Turkey; the electrical Interconnection project of the Mediterranean countries (MEDRING); the project of the Pan Arab Electrical Interconnection; and the Regional Interconnection project (EIJP).  Therefore, a new 400 kV transmission line from Aqaba in the south of Jordan to the north-east, outside of Amman, is considered essential to reinforce the Jordanian network and permit it to participate in the above-mentioned interconnection projects.     

Preliminary feasibility studies were performed on the Jordanian national network and on the interconnected networks of the EIJLLST countries.  These studies showed that there would be important improvements benefiting the Jordanian national electricity sector and interconnected networks from the addition of the proposed 400 kV line.  This high voltage transmission line is vital to the country’s power security and reliability as well as the economic power exchange between neighboring countries.  This project would connect a 365 km 400 kV double circuit overhead transmission line from the Aqaba 400 kV substation located in the south of Jordan, through the Wadi Araba valley, the Dead Sea, the south of Madaba, and to the east of Amman to reach its final destination, the 400 kV substation north-east of Amman. The proposed project would strengthen the infrastructure of the current interconnection, and build trade capacity, which will allow for the establishment of a large electrical market for exchange and trading of electricity between the countries in the North Africa/Middle East region.  Jordan will benefit from the electricity wheeling charges from the transfer of electrical energy among the interconnected countries.  Since Jordan occupies a strategic location between east and west, constructing this 400 kV Transmission Line will facilitate such power exchange.  

Implementation of this project would also create an appropriate electric network location to be connected with an Iraqi network of the 400 kV level.  The proposed study has been identified as the most important power project by both NEPCO and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.  According to NEPCO, this project constitutes a significant bottleneck relief in their high voltage transmission network.  None of the other major internal and regional projects, including reinforcement of interconnection with Egypt and possible future interconnection with Iraq, will yield any substantial results until the 400 kV transmission line from Aqaba to Amman and corresponding infrastructure is constructed.  The study consultant will conduct:  1) Review of Available Data and Current System Configuration; 2) Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Review; 3) Regional Electricity Market and Technical Evaluation; 4) Preparation of Preliminary Design and Estimates; 5) Preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment; 6) Preparation of Detailed Design and Estimates; 7) Financing Options Review; 8) Tender Documents Preparation; and 9) Final Report. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $363,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to Dr. Judith H. Hibbard, University of Oregon, Department of Planning, Public Policy & Management, Eugene, Oregon 97403-1209. The purpose of this statement of work is to provide an early assessment of beneficiary knowledge and awareness of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (MPDB) and to identify characteristics of beneficiaries who 	may either have difficulty understanding or securing assistance in making their choices or who may be disinclined to enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (MPDP). This project will build on a related AARP study.  The AARP funded study involves the development and testing of Medicare knowledge items which will be used in a survey of 	beneficiaries fielded in the fall of 2005.  This study will test some of these same items developed for the larger fall survey	
Hibbard and colleagues (2005) have developed a screening index to assess health 	literacy in older adults.  The three variables in the weighted index are: respondent 	age, self-rated health status, and education.  The index can be used to quickly and 	easily identify those who have marginal or inadequate literacy.  It has a relatively high level of both sensitivity and specificity for predicting health literacy levels.  	In a recent study seventy-one percent of respondents are correctly classified by the screening index as either a true positive (low health literacy) or a true negative (adequate health literacy).  The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item measure, developed by Judy Hibbard that assesses patient knowledge, skill and confidence for self-management.  The measure was developed using Rasch analyses and is an interval level, uni-dimensional, Guttman-like measure.  The measure has strong psychometric properties and is predictive of subsequent health behaviors and disease-specific self-management behaviors. There are several reasons why an open competition is not feasible for this contract.  First, the study builds on a current AARP study under the direction of Dr. Judith Hibbard.  Second the contracted work calls for the use of the Patient Activation Measure (PAM).  This measure was developed by Dr. Hibbard and colleagues at the University of Oregon.  Their team has more experience than any other in using the measure and interpreting findings. Finally, the work also calls for the use of a new instrument that is used to screen for health literacy in an older population.  This tool was also developed by Hibbard and her team. Given the nature of the proposed work, it would be impossible to find another team that would match expertise and experience found on the Hibbard team.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the consulting services of Dr. Shunro Sonoda, Kagoshima University, 8 35 1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, Japan for a five month base year with one seven month option period.  HTLV-I, the prototype human retrovirus, is known to cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and infectious dermatitis.  The virus is transmitted by transfusion of unscreened blood, by breast feeding of infants and young children, and by sexual intercourse among adults.  A priority of the VEB is to improve the understanding of the process by which HTLV-I causes ATL and other serious diseases which could lead to interventions to prevent and possibly even treat affected people.  Shunro Sonoda, MD, DMedSci, is the Ex-Professor and Chairman of the Department of Virology and Island Medicine and is Professor Emeritus of the Research Development Center of Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.  Prof. Sonoda has published 108 papers in the scientific peer review literature, plus 16 book chapters and monographs.  For more than 20 years, his career has been highly focused on the human and viral molecular genetics of HTLV-I infection and the diseases related to HTLV-I infection.  Dr. Sonoda will be providing the following services to the VEB:  1) review the scientific protocols and field manuals for all HTLV-I projects currently being conducted by the  VEB, and write a critique of each project highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each project;  2)  protocol development, field implementation, interim evaluation, and final evaluation of a clinical trial to examine the effect of daily consumption of capsules containing green tea extract on HTLV-I proviral load and on signs and symptoms of TSP among HTLV-I-infected adults in Jamaica;  3)  select from the biospecimen repository specimens to be tested for HTLV-I proviral load, HTLV-I antibodies and antibody titers, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and other human gene testing, and other related assays;  4)  data analyses, particularly but not exclusively HLA genotype and haplotype data in both population and family studies;  5) summarize the results of analyses and in writing reports for internal use and for submission to the peer review scientific literature for publication.  Dr. Sonoda’s deep and broad specific experience with HTLV-I research make him uniquely qualified to provide these services. He is unquestionably one of the leading authorities on laboratory procedures for determining and for interpreting human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and haplotype.  He discovered the anti-proliferative and anti-viral effects of green tea polyphenols and conducted the first clinical trial of green tea extract against HTLV-I, demonstrating beneficial effect of reducing the level of HTLV-I in the blood cells. 
Dr. Sonoda is the only known source to the NCI researchers with this knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on March 31, 2005.

<SUBJECT>S -- PRIVATIZATION OF THE ELECTRICAL UTILITY SYSTEM AT FORT CAMPBELL, KY.
<SOLNBR>SP0600-05-R-0013
<ARCHDATE>04012005
<CONTACT>Christine Bond-Jawish, Facility Energy Specialist, Phone 7037673298, Fax 7037672382, Email christine.bondjawish@dla.mil - Benita Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone 703 767-9407, Fax 703 767-2382, Email benita.jackson@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

Installation: Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Location: Fort Campbell, Kentucky occupies over 105,000 acres on the Kentucky-Tennessee border between Hopkinsville, KY and Clarksville, TN.  Although nearly two-thirds of the post is actually in Tennessee, the post office is located in Kentucky, and the identification lies within that state. 

Installation Description:  The United States Army opened Camp Campbell in 1942 as a temporary site for performing military training operations.  The camp was named in honor of William Bowen Campbell, a Tennessee statesman and Brigadier General of the United States Volunteers during the Civil War.  In April of 1950, the post was declared a permanent installation and re-designated as Fort Campbell.  Since then, the fort has hosted the U.S. Army Training Center and headquarters; participated in military operations in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Iraq, and Afghanistan; supported humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda and Somalia; and supplied peacekeepers to Haiti and Bosnia.  The fort’s mission is “to support training, mobilization, and deployment of mission-ready forces.”  It strives “to provide services, facilities, and a safe and secure environment for our soldiers, civilians, retirees, veterans and their families, while transforming for the future.”

Fort Campbell is currently home to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), nicknamed “Screaming Eagles”, as well as Division Artillery, Division Support Command, the 101st Aviation Brigade, the 159th Aviation Brigade, the 101st Corps Support Group, and a number of other separate commands.  Activities on the fort include field training exercises, aviation activities, live-fire qualification and training, special operations maneuver training, and administrative and support activities.  Facilities on post include the Campbell and Sabre Army Airfields, the Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, recreational activities, historical museums, and other community support activities.

Today, the installation’s total population includes 26,500 active duty personnel, 3,900 civil servants, and 58,200 family members.  In addition, the fort supports 138,400 veterans and retirees.  The number of active duty personnel fluctuates as much as 50% depending on deployment status.  The total population is scheduled to increase in the near future due to military unit restructuring.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.  Electric System Description:  The Fort Campbell electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation defined by Section J01.10 of this section or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The system may include, but is not limited to transformers, underground and overhead circuits, utility poles, switches, streetlights, and vaults (traffic lights are not included in this contract).  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description. Under no circumstances shall the successful Contractor be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.

The installation shall retain joint use of all electrical utility poles.

All transformers have had all polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s) removed. 

Primary power enters the installation at four locations.  Power transmission lines carrying 69 kV enter the fort from Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) on the east side off of Route 41A.  An alternate 69 kV power feed and new substation (called Screaming Eagle) are being constructed near Gate 10.  Upon completion, the substation will be owned by TVA. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation (CEMC) supplies 14.4 kV power at Range 28 and Range 29. They also supply 7.2 kV to the landfill, however CEMC owns and maintains the lines serving the landfill, so this area will not be included in the contract.  Pennyrile Rural Electric Cooperative (Pennyrile) supplies 14.4 kV to Range 46.  There is an off-site location called Red River where there is an emergency water pump station.  Power commodity is provided to this area by Clarksville Department of Electricity (CDE).  

There are approximately 14 miles of 69 kV transmission line and seven substations.  In addition, there are approximately 264 miles of distribution line and 7 substations.  The fort is in the midst of a $10 million upgrade to its electrical transmission and distribution system that is scheduled to be complete by April 2005.  Average monthly consumption is approximately 20.9 million kilowatt hours with usage peaking in late summer to early fall.  Emergency generators will remain under the ownership of the installation.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the Electric Distribution System.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Christine Bond Jawish at 703-767-3298 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after March 31, 2005.

<DESC>SSA-RFP-05-1028: TV STUDIO UPGRADE TO HD. SSA has an onsite full performance Television Studio.  The technology is outdated and potentially obsolete with the nationally mandated conversion to HDTV. SSA has seeks to upgrade the existing SDI equipment to the HD SDI standard. This approach provides the most cost-effective solution maximizing the investment in existing production and postproduction systems. However, the majority of existing SDI equipment is not upgradeable to the new HD SDI standard and will need to be replaced. SSA’s plan for up-grading the existing plant from SD SDI to HD SDI capability presents the same challenges faced by many industry wide broadcast professionals as considerations are given to how to achieve transition from SD to HD in a reasonable manor without disposing of the existing investment made in SD digital television equipment. A hybrid approach to the problem offers to be the best short to mid-term solution allowing reasonable service life of existing SD equipment while transitioning over time to a total HD SDI environment. Items to be addressed are (1) The determination of which HDTV camera system is selected establishes the overall signal quality and performance standards for the entire HDTV system. (2) The selection of a master HDTV recording format is the second most important decision faced. (3) The third most important technical consideration is the production switcher, signal processing, distribution and routing systems. (4) The selection of an HDTV non-linear post-production edit system is the next most important decision affecting the quality of the final product. Additionally, the selected contractor will provide on-Site training on Equipment/Software provided under the contract, on-site Program/Engineering support, Hardware Maintenance and Software Maintenance with telephone support and other services as necessary for the ongoing project. SSA is seeking a Small Business vendor who will assess the SSA studio’s needs, provide engineering support for the upgrade, provide and maintain the new equipment (hardware and software) and recommend steps for future upgrades. This requirement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE UNDER NAICS CODE 511199. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, materials, services and equipment described in the Solicitation when issued.  The contract will be a Fixed Price Requirements type with a Base Year and up to four One Year Options.  SSA anticipates the upgrade to HD will be done incrementally.  Any qualified Small Business firm which believes it has the Technical Capabilities and the Relevant Experience to perform the described tasks should read the solicitation when issued. Teaming arrangements are welcome.  The solicitation will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS WEB Site (www2.eps.gov) on or about March 30, 2005 with proposals due on or about April 29, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>BINARY ENERGY MANAGEMENT Program (BEM), SOL BAA05-19 Addendum 5, Due:  June 23, 2005

POC: Dr. Rosemarie Szostak, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4588, Email: BAA05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519.

PROGRAM GOALS:

This BAA request proposals for enabling technologies for high explosive systems such that the system can be switched from a state that is completely unreactive (will not detonate) to a fully sensitive energetic system.  The scheme used to facilitate the mechanism of transition cannot be compromised, i.e. the scheme by which the system is switched requires an external action without which the system will remain inert.  It is also important that the amount of energy that the energetic system can release is not diluted to achieve the inert state.  The ability to achieve a continuum of performance between an inert and a sensitive state is desirable but not required.

It is not the intent of the DARPA Program to develop high explosive warheads through this BAA.  Rather, this program will demonstrate enabling technologies required for ultimate development of such systems.  Therefore, solutions proposed in response to this BAA must be consistent with size/weight/volume requirements of existing warheads.

BACKGROUND:

Sensitivity of energetic materials to unexpected impact, friction, shock waves, and thermal loading is a critical military issue.  This concern has led to the formulation of new safety requirements for munitions and the desire for the development of insensitive munitions (IM).  The requirements for safety are described in Title 10 US Code, Chapter 14, Section 2389 and in DoD Directive 5000.1.  Present IM development has focused on a combination of less sensitive energetic fill formulations, mitigation techniques and packaging.  Though more insensitive then their predecessors, the present energetic fill formulations fall far short of the goal of being totally insensitive.  These less sensitive formulations also lack the properties of the prior sensitive energetic material [total energy content, pressure pulse, and detonation velocity].  The present approach to achieve insensitivity of fill formulations relies on dilution of the energetic component relative to the binding resulting in less desirable total energy content, pressure and detonation velocity upon initiation.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

The objective of this two phase program will be to develop a system containing an energetic fill and a control scheme that can demonstrate a mechanism by which the energetic fill can be switched between completely insensitive mode and full energy release.  This control scheme cannot be compromised and the output of energy when the system is detonated cannot be diluted to obtain insensitivity.  An ideal system for this program is defined as having a detonation effectiveness equivalent to or exceeding CL-20 (Edet = 317 kcal/cc, Pcj = 420 kbar) In Phase I (not to exceed 12 months) performers will demonstrate at the laboratory bread-board level the end states of their system that is 1) the insensitive mode (state) and 2) full energy release mode and the mechanism by which these modes can be switched.  Energy release in Phase I need not be optimized but should constitute at least 70 percent release of the total energy (Edet and Pcj).  In Phase II the performers will integrate the scheme used to achieve the switching mechanism with the fill and optimize energy release for maximum energy output (Edet and Pcj).  Performers will also demonstrate that the system (fill and switching scheme) cannot be compromised under the requirements for insensitive munitions, i.e., the system will not detonate under the specific assaults of cook-off, penetration, and sympathetic detonation.

Phase I Program Requirements—Laboratory bread-board demonstration of principle.

The insensitivity and energy content of the fill and the mechanism for switching or dialing between insensitive to sensitive will be demonstrated.

1.  Insensitivity Testing and Requirements:

Small scale (laboratory scale) Insensitive Munitions (IM) tests for cook-off, bullet/fragment penetration and shape charge impact will be used to determine insensitivity using the procedures described in NAVSEA INSTRUCTION 8020.5C, of 05 May 2000.  Enclosure (3) of NAVSEA INSTRUCTION 8020.5C provides detailed procedures to be followed in laboratory testing for insensitivity.  Requirements are (1) Fast and slow cook-off:  No reaction more severe than controlled burning (i.e., the rate of combustion is constant).  (2) Bullet/fragment penetration:  Unreactive or no response more severe than controlled burning.  (3) Shape charge impact:  No reaction more severe than controlled burning.  (4) Sympathetic detonation:  No detonation from 25 grams of explosive system energetic material (as configured in the explosive system) at the same distance at which 25 grams of TATB is detonated by 25 grams of C-4 (initiator explosive).

2.  Switching Mechanism:

Successfully demonstrate in laboratory scale experiments a mechanism to transition or dial from insensitive state to state where energy release (detonation) is achieved.

3.  Full Energy Release and Requirement:

Demonstrate the end state of the system will result in detonation with at least the following characteristics:  The explosive energetic system must demonstrate at least 70 percent of the detonation effectiveness of the calculated output. 

Phase II Program Requirements—Larger scale, integrated components system demonstration.

The system for Phase II is defined as the optimization of the system components demonstrated in Phase I such that upon integration of the components the size, weight and volume of the system  are commensurate  with existing warheads while still meeting the specific metrics of Phase I.  

SUBMISSION OF WHITE PAPERS:

We strongly encourage white papers in advance of full proposals.  Each white paper will address concept technical issues and capabilities of the proposing organization.

<DESC>The Department of Justice intends to award a task order against a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract for acquisition management support.  This requirement was initially publicized on December 9, 2004, as a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA).  However, the Government has changed its acquisition strategy and now plans to conduct a competition amongst GSA FSS small business firms.  

The Justice Management Division’s (JMD) Justice Consolidated Office Network Program Management Office (JCON PMO) requires acquisition support services from one full-time equivalent (FTE).  Support services include but are not limited to: acquisition planning, market research and analysis, development of procurement packages, preparation and issuance of delivery/task orders and review of contract deliverables.  

The Government intends to award a GSA FSS task order to the small business whose proposal represents the best value to the agency.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611, with a size standard of $6,000,000.00.  Those small business firms who possess GSA FSS contracts and are interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may contact Constance D. Fortune at connie.fortune@usdoj.gov.  All responses must be received electronically no later than Monday, March 28, 2005 at 2:00 PM local time.

The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager, Fire Support Systems (PM FSS), is interested in acquiring information on either commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items or non-developmental items (NDI) that will accomplish precision parallel gun laying-in tasks while increasing ruggedness and supportability over the M2A2 aiming circles currently in use since 1982.  Product information should include, but not be limited to, complete understanding of Marine Corps field artillery operations, precision gun-laying, maintenance and supply support.  The Marine Corps seeks COTS or NDI be: 1) the same size or smaller than the M2A2 Aiming Circle, NSN 1290-01-067-0687; 2) replicate current operating procedures found in Technical Manual (TM) 9-2350-311-10; operating characteristics are found in Field Manual (FM) 23-90, Chapter 2, Section II, paragraph 2-4, Characteristics.  Both TM and FM are easily downloaded from the Internet; 3) require no change in operator and maintainer training; 4) be ruggedized to withstand rapid maneuver operations in the field; 5) be rapidly supportable by government or commercial logistics package; 6) be produced with advanced production techniques and materials improved or introduced since 1982; 7) compare favorably in price to the M2A2 Aiming Circle ($3,725.00 unit price as listed in FEDLOG); and 8) weigh equal to or less than the M2A2 aiming circle.  Please send product information ONLY (no samples) to Marine Corps Systems Command,  Attn PG 144 Project Officer, Fielded Firing Systems, Major Michael B. Seger, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia 22134-6050.  The product information will be used as an indication that companies have a COTS or NDI system readily available.  Potential contractors must be able to produce a minimum of 50 systems per month, with a surge capability of no less that 80 systems per month.  The precision parallel gun laying-in survey equipment must be able to meet or exceed M2A2 Aiming Circle precision capabilities.  If your company has an existing, COTS or NDI that meets these requirements, please provide brochures or other information relative to the performance, maintenance, and physical characteristics (i.e., size, weight, etc.) of the product.  This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice.  THERE IS NO FORMAL SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  NO AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS MARKET SURVEY.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the 30mm PGU-15/B TP Cartridge.  Cartridge components include an aluminum cartridge case, nose cap, projectile body, M36A2 percussion primer,  and propellant.  Cartridge performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Velocity, Chamber Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy, Environmental Conditions, and Waterproofness.  The technical data package (TDP) is classified Distribution D (Auth orized to the Department of Defense and DoD contractors only).  WARNING - This document contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, (Title  50, U.S.C., APP 2401, ET SEQ) as amended.  Violation of these export laws is subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a  copy of the specification and top drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  A respondent to this market survey must have the facilities and skills required to design and qualify the 30mm PGU-15/B TP cartridge.  Specific produ ction capabilities and skills required to manufacture the 30mm PGU-15/B TP Cartridge are as follows: prime case machine to insert the flashtube assembly and percussion primer into the cartridge case; propellant loader to weigh propellant and charge the car tridge case; cartridge assembly loader to insert the projectile body into the cartridge case, crimp, and gage cartridge chamber and height; pack-out equipment to assemble cartridges into tubes and load into containers; and ballistic test facilities and equ ipment for measuring velocity, pressure, action time, time of flight, etc.  Besides Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) equipment, additional production capabilities required are furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anod ize and phosphate systems, material handling systems, tool room equipment, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of the PGU-15/B Cartridge is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Spec ific skills required to produce the PGU-15/B Cartridge include: ammunition process/design engineers, set-up mechanics familiar with ammunition component and LAP production equipment; toolmakers and machinists to support all production facilities/equipment;  personnel for programming and operation of LAP manufacturing equipment; certified inspectors, quality control engineers, and ballistics test personnel for in-process and final inspection, pack-out, First Article Test (FAT) and Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) ba llistics testing, and shipment of ammunition products; machine operators for set-up and operation of various metal forming and machine tool production manufacturing equipment; personnel with expertise to control heat treat, quench, temper of metal products  to obtain ductility and hardness requirements; personnel familiar with phosphate and anodizing systems; ultrasonic technicians; metallurgists to test raw materials throughout the process to a finished product; personnel with extensive expertise in the man ufacture and handling of propellant; and skills needed to maintain several items of unique or special type pieces of the equipment and facilities.  These critical skills require an extended period to acquire the job knowledge adequate to provide a quality product in a timely manner.

<SUBJECT>J -- Aviation Maintenance Support Services
<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT LISTED BELOW.

No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  Information is being requested in order to make our potential future requirement better for industry and the Government.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is interested in information from industry on best practices for the aviation maintenance and related support services contract that will end September 30, 2007.  The effort is located mainly at the Department of Justice (DOJ), DEA, Aviation Division, Office of Aviation Operations (OA), 2300 Horizon Drive, Fort Worth, Texas, 76177, and other locations.

The solicitation potentially would be directed to the entire Aviation Maintenance Community including current Government contractors as well as large commercial maintenance operations. The DEA Aviation Maintenance Operation resembles the functions of a large Fixed Base Operator (FBO) or overhaul facility.  The DEA follows the Federal Aviation Regulations in all maintenance, parts acquisition, parts storage and parts disposal.

The duration of this contract effort is currently proposed to be one year with 4 option years.   The core effort includes program management, training support, logistical support, aircraft maintenance support, and administrative support necessary to sustain the DEA-operated aircraft fleet in a safe, reliable, and fully mission capable condition at the Aviation Division.

Currently, task orders may be issued for support services for any aircraft designated by the DEA.  These include, but are not limited to, foreign government-owned aircraft, Department of Justice law enforcement agencies, other law enforcement Civilian Agencies, and selected Department of Defense (DOD) or other Federal Agencies.  Task Orders would identify the specific work to be performed outside of the core effort.

BACKGROUND
DEA’s mission responsibilities are worldwide.  The Office of Aviation’s role in this mission is to provide total aviation support worldwide to carry out those missions.  The provision of a total aviation support system will ensure that the security and integrity of all flight-related systems and support functions are maintained.  In addition to domestic operations, throughout the fifty states, the DEA Office of Aviation operates outside the United States in cooperation with individual host countries, and as such, conducts flight missions the nature of which vary from country-to-country.

The DEA-owned and leased aircraft are presently deployed and supported from a main operating site located at the Alliance Airport Facility, Fort Worth, Texas, and at other field operating sites located in Hilo and Honolulu, Hawaii; Houston Texas, Ft Lauderdale Florida, Newark New Jersey, Long Beach California, Puerto Rico, Nassau Bahamas, and other Caribbean locations; Mexico; and South and Central America.  However, as mission responsibilities dictate, operating site locations may change, and operating sites may be established and/or deleted in locations both domestically and foreign.

The DEA assets include approximately 100 commercial fixed and rotor wing, single and multi-engine aircraft, piston, turbine and jet aircraft some of which are modified and equipped with state-of-the-art, highly sophisticated sensor equipment designed to facilitate detection and apprehension of violators.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
The desire of the DEA is to move to a performance based contract.  Specific requirements are as follows:

Nonpersonal services for all materials, personnel, equipment (to include uniforms, common hand tools, personal safety equipment such as safety glasses, gloves and shoes or boots) necessary to manage and maintain all aspects of an effective maintenance support organization designed to meet changing operational demands. The maintenance actions include but are not limited to fixed and rotor wing scheduled inspections, unscheduled maintenance, avionics/special equipment install, sheet metal repairs and fabrication; piston engine overhaul, Rolls Royce 250 modular overhaul, PT6 hot sections, NDT and inspection, fuel lab operations and minor paint.

Acquire and maintain all materials (i.e., acquisitions, storage, quality control, repair, packaging, and shipping) until they are consumed in support of the aircraft fleet.

Be fully responsible for the correction of all damage and/or defects, within the limitation of liability, that are directly attributable to the contractor’s personnel or any subcontractor’s performance or actions under this requirement.

Provide qualified personnel, equipment, supplies and services, for the Program Management; Flight Support to include Training; Logistics, Acquisition, Aircraft Maintenance; Administrative Support to include Property Management, Environmental, Health, and Safety, Hazardous Material Control necessary to sustain the DEA/Designated aircraft fleet in a safe and airworthy condition.

Provide full service fixed and rotor wing ground and flight training at designated training facilities. The government reserves the right to provide training course material to support the Training Course Material and to provide training facilities at the Alliance facility or other locations to support the training program. The contractor will be required to maintain/replenish the training course materials. The Government will furnish training aircraft; however, the contractor may be required to provide selected training aircraft.

During the life of the contract requirement, the Government may require the contractor to operate and man the DEA aviation communications center, coordinate loading/unloading of cargo, perform pre-flight planning, perform dispatch duties, and monitor and track aircraft identified by the DEA during scheduled departures and arrivals from take-off through successful arrival at its destination and vise-versa.

The contractor may be required to lease aircraft or other equipment in support of the aviation mission. The contractor may be required to provide flight crews for selected leased or DEA owned aircraft.

Operate in accordance with Federal, state, local, and DEA restrictions, and be responsible for obtaining, on behalf of DEA, any rights-of-way, permits, waivers, approvals or licenses and/or certificates required in connection with the operation, maintenance and related support services at the DEA-owned Alliance Facility or any other locations where maintenance activities are conducted.

Normal hours of operation at the Alliance Facility are Monday – Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.   All other hours are considered other than normal hours of operation.  Specific support hours of operation for Hawaii, Nassau and other domestic and foreign areas may be established at different times according to local time zones.  The contractor personnel may be required to be available at earlier or later times other than during normal hours of operation.

Aircraft Maintenance Support is currently on the basis of one shift.  That shift will begin at 8:30 a.m. through 5:00 p.m.; thereby, allowing one-half hour for lunch breaks.  The contractor provides a second or third shift operation in any or all locations as required.

The DEA Office of Aviation follows the federal holiday schedule and expects the contractor to do the same with no payment for work performed on those days unless the contractor personnel have been labeled as “essential” and the work is requested by the Government in advance.

Travel to both domestic and foreign locations. TDY for periods of up to 120 days may be required. Valid passports will be required.

Title to Government Furnished Data will remain in the Government.

The Government will provide a computer system (hardware/software), to include personal computers (PC), local area networks (LAN), and related support hardware and software.  The Government-provided computer system is subject to change as technology upgrades and funds are available.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES FOR BEYOND GOLDWATER-NICHOLS REFORMS
<DESC>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) performed the first half of this work as directed by Congress in FY04.  The current task from Congress looks to complete the Beyond Goldwater-Nichols work by focusing on regional command struc tures, Guard and Reserve components, and the acquisition process.   Statement of work:  The goal of Beyond Goldwater-Nichols is to help build enough support for defense reform that policy recommendations generated by the study will be implemented in legisl ation and the current administration.  As Secretary Rumsfeld learned during the early months of his tenure, transforming the military is a formidable challenge with many political, bureaucratic and financial obstacles.   The original Goldwater-Nichols Act helped the Department of Defense overcome the organizational impediments to military operational effectiveness.  Beyond Goldwater-Nichols wants to build on this success by identifying those organizational changes needed to ensure that in ten to fifteen yea rs, the Department of Defense will have the right capabilities, and enough of them, to cope with the challenges of that time.  Tasks under the contract include an assessment of the organizational structure and mission of the Department of Defense and its c omponents to provide defense reform and policy recommendations.  The following topics must be included in this effort:  Role of the National Guard and Reserves in the Total Force; Organizing the Combatant Commands Below the Four-Star Level; and DoD Acquisi tion System for Non-ACAT System Goods.  The contract work is expected to take one year from the date of contract award.  Performance shall be principally at the contractors facility with periodic visits to the Pentagon and other DoD required facilities in  the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  The Government intends to award a sole-source contract to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for this work. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CON TRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RFP IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  Organizations that believe they possess the capability necessary to undertake the work described should submit their capabilities package by 4:00 p.m. local time prevailing, March 23, 2005.  No extensions will be granted.  Firms capability statement should be as complete a package as possible.  Specify services that can be provided and include your resource capabilities as well.  The capability package should demonstrate firms ability to pe rform the specific tasks that are being requested in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  This requirement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334210 (formerly SIC code 3661) at a 1,000 size standard.
 
The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools materials, and other items and services necessary to support the requirement in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (S00) FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION SYSTEM (DODIIS) VOICE OVER IP (VOIP) SYSTEM

1.0 - INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Objective: Determine the VoIP feasibility and implementation in the DoDIIS Community.

1.2 Scope and Constraints: This effort covers the infrastructure to be located at each of the regional service centers (RSCs) and IP phones that will be required to support VoIP in the DoDIIS environment.  This infrastructure will operate at the TS/SCI level and will interconnect the NSA Secure Telephone System (NSTS).  There will not be any interconnection with the unclassified voice system or internet. The operational fielded VoIP networks existing within DoDIIS supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) must interoperate with the proposed VoIP system.

1.3 Background:  The DoDIIS community is comprised of DoD Intelligence community users that work at many locations around the world.  These users are supported by a world wide IT infrastructure that gives them the capability to collaborate, share, and disseminate information.  JWICS, described briefly below, is the transport network that supports this infrastructure.  The RSCs, also described briefly below, provide all the required common applications for these users.

1.3.1 JWICS: The Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) is the global backbone network for the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) providing direct support to a wide range of users -- from the policy makers, to the unified commands, to the Warfighters in the field. The JWICS network is also the primary Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) component of the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) Defense Information System Network (DISN). As such, it is a 24-hour-a-day; 7-day-a-week networked capability designed to meet the requirement for secure (TOP SECRET SCI) high speed multimedia communications.  JWICS supports 160 permanent user locations worldwide as well as over 40 deployable systems that are used by the Major Commands in all crises since Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  This is a closed network that does not interconnect to any public networks.  The services supported by the network include, but are not limited to: IP data transport, point-to-point and multipoint video teleconferences (VTCs), and video broadcasts.  The JWICS Program is now expanding the infrastructure to support Voice over IP (VoIP).  The DoDIIS VoIP infrastructure will be located at each of the Regional Service Centers (RSCs) or distributed within a 100 mile radius proximity of the RSC locations. DoDIIS currently has over 1150 VoIP phone endpoints supporting a critical operational network at CENTCOM.  Also, DoDIIS has over 40 deployable C-JWICS and JMICS tactical mobile units utilizing an operational VoIP network supporting OIF.  The proposed VoIP system must be able to place secure phone calls, connect, maintain calls without dropping while utilizing standard PBX features (listed in the DoDIIS technical requirements, section 1.15) into CENTCOM operational VoIP system and the C-JWICS/JMICS tactical VoIP network. 

1.3.2 RSCs: The DoDIIS Architecture will transition to a new IT organizational construct that implements geographically dispersed information management centers. The RSCs will provide the Defense Intelligence customers and analysts’ access to data, applications, and core services.  The RSC geographical regions and sponsors are as follows:  Washington, DC - Bolling Air Force Base; Tampa, FL – USCENTCOM; Colorardo Springs, CO – USNORTHCOM; Hawaii – USPACOM; Stuttgart, GE – USEUCOM.   The RSC will include IT capabilities and future data, applications and core services into the RSC domain based on the processes outlined in this document. 

1.3.2.1 Virtual vs. Physical RSC Architecture: The RSC implementation will be accomplished using a virtual, regional architecture. This “virtual” vice “physical” implementation approach allows each RSC to immediately exploit existing IT capabilities within its geographic region--not every RSC component needs to be physically collocated to be effective. As an example, in Europe the IT components could be located at Stuttgart, RAF Molesworth UK, and Naples IT. Over time some consolidation of IT capabilities and services will occur when cost or mission support benefits can be realized. The initial RSC locations were based on the location of JIVA components and will be evaluated over time to determine if adjustments are warranted.  The geographical location of a RSC or its component elements may change over time if for mission support purposes, cost, or disaster recovery concerns indicate that an adjustment is warranted. The DoDIIS VoIP infrastructure equipment will be located at each of the Regional Service Centers (RSCs) or distributed at another site within a 100 mile radius proximity of a RSC location as listed in paragraph 1.3.2.  The DoDIIS VoIP system must support load balance and automatic failover for calls and voice mail without human intervention to another IP PBX(s)/voice mail server(s) located within a 100 mile radius proximity of a RSC location or other distributed site. 

1.3.2.2 RSC Capabilities: Each RSC will provide a number of IT capabilities for its supported region. These capabilities are composed of critical GDIP mission applications, data, and core services that are shared or used by more than one organization. This may take the form of hosting the data and application within the RSC, providing access to the data through a portal or middleware hosted at the RSC, or by organizations providing access to the data on their external servers (e.g., Intelink). Other capabilities such as imagery and intelligence-related Command and Control applications such as the Global Command and Control System Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (GCCS-I3) will also be included in the RSCs. Initially, the core set of RSC capabilities provided will include the DMS, IDS, access to the JIVA community applications and tools, application and data recovery capabilities by embedding support from the DRP, and full use and access via the Full Service Directory (FSD) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) programs. As such, bandwidth conservation is critical to ensure these RSC applications will be readily available for users to support vital intelligence missions.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise information regarding the space waiver that is in process, to add one option year to this requirement, and to address a question that has been submitted regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

A space waiver is in process to provide approval for up to eight (8) contractor employees to sit in DISA spaces located at Skyline 7 in Falls Church, VA. 

The period of performance is one (1) year from date of award with an additional one (1) year option period. The Government estimate includes the following labor categories and hours for this requirement: Program/Project Manager (120 hours); Program Analyst (Mid-Level) (9,480 hours); Program Analyst (Junior Level) (3,840 hours); Database Developer (Junior Level) (1,920 hours); and Administrative Assistant (Mid-Level) (1,100 hours). A similar level of effort is projected for the one option year added as an amendment to the solicitation. This will be a firm fixed price contract for a base year and one option year. 

Submitted Question: Is it possible for the NAICS to be changed to a NAICS such as 541519 that has a higher SB limit?

Response: DISA has carefully considered the issue of changing the NAICS code for this procurement. Historically, NAICS code 541611 has been used for two prior related efforts for GCCS-J Program Control Management Support Services. This NAICS code was first used in FY2003 and was associated with DAPPR30038. The second use of this NAICS code was in FY2004 and was associated with HC1047-04-R-4037. Considering that this requirement has previously been synopsized with NAICS code 541611, the NAICS code for this procurement will remain as 541611 with a corresponding qualifying size standard of $6 million.

The response date remains unchanged as does the date for submission of any questions. 

Also, as a temporary measure, since this requirement was synopsized the contract specialist has been affected by the incident resulting in building lock downs at Bailey's Crossroad (specifically, 5111 Leesburg Pike). Offeror's questions should be submitted to matchison@earthlink.net until further notice.

<DESC>Potential offerors are responsible for acknowledging all amendments to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

The purpose of this amendment is to remove FAR Clause 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies (JUNE 2003); FAR Provision 52.225-2, Buy American Act Certificate (JUNE 2003); and DFAR Clause 252.225-7001, Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program (APR 2003); and incorporate by reference DFAR Clause 252.225-7021 Trade Agreements (JAN 2005), and in full text, DFAR Provision 252.225-7020 Trade Agreements Certificate (JAN 2005).  

In addition, the following questions and answers are provided for the information of all potential offerors:

17.  Clarification to Q&A #7 and #15 - Power for "Racks" - If the actual "racks" require power (for a fan, other?), please provide the requirements in order to size the UPS properly.  Are the racks being provided as GFE?  The racks will not be provided as GFE as previously stated.  We expect all potential offerors to have the ability to develop their total VoIP solution power requirements since the potential offerors “should” know the power requirements of the components that they are recommending. 
 
18.  Clarification to Q&A #8 (ref. 2.6) - Call Accounting System - Is a call accounting system needed for each RSC or does DIA require one for the entire network? Each RSC must have the capability to view and analysis call detail records. 
 
19.  What is the expected date of contract award? On or about 11 March 2005
 
20.  Please provide the model number of the Tandberg H.323 endpoints for requirement 3.2. Tandberg 1000
 
21.  Requirement 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 – Maintenance - What is the “term” of the desired maintenance support? Annual
 
22.  Requirement 3.5 – Is this annual maintenance for all equipment on a “parts only” basis? The requirement is clear.  For example, if the IP PBX should have failure due to a software or hardware problem, then the annual maintenance should include support telephonic and on-site support to fix as required. 
 
23.  Requirement 3.6 – Is the specialized, on-site 3-hour response time on a time and materials basis? Please explain. Yes. 
 
24.  Requirement 2.1 System Requirements – Can DIA provide a definition of GA (Generally Available) as referenced in Section 2.1? GA (Generally Available) software releases and hardware are mature and stable, having successfully passed through all earlier release stages and proven themselves through widespread use to be very reliable and bug/problem free. 
 
25.  Our review of the solicitation revealed technical requirements contemplate use of the VoIP system in a manner which requires compliance with Section 353 of Public Law 107-314, “Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003” (December 2, 2002) (the “FY03 National Defense Authorization Act” or “Section 353”), Department of Defense (“DoD) Instruction (“DoDI”) 8100.3, and Department of Defense Voice Networks Generic Switching Center Requirements (“GSCR”) (September 8, 2003).   However, there is a lack of discussion in the solicitation of the requirement for certification and accreditation required pursuant to DoDI 8100.3.  Please specify the level of certification and accreditation required.  The DoDIIS Voice over IP (VoIP) implementation planned by DIA is intended only to meet intelligence requirements for the DoD Intelligence community and will not connect to the DSN, the DRSN, or the PSTN.

8.  Special Instructions.

i.  Part II – Technical Proposal Section

(A)   Offerors shall submit a six column matrix, incorporating Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements as the first column and adding the subsequent column headings: Hardware Components, Hardware GA Dates, Software Release, Software Release GA Date and Description of How Requirement is Fully Compliant by the proposed VOIP system.  The matrix shall be used as a tool to demonstrate the offerors compliance with each of the technical specifications.  Failure to provide the matrix will deem the contractor as non-responsive and therefore unacceptable.
     
ii.  Part I – Past and Present Performance Information Section.
      
The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror’s experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP.  The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as the Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.  Provide a list of at least three (3), but no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date that demonstrate your ability to perform the proposed effort.  Relevant contracts as defined under Evaluation Procedures for past performance.  Past performance demonstrating experience in pure IP deploying will be given a rating.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating “neutral”, meaning the rating is rated neither favorable nor unfavorably.

 iii.  PART III– Cost/Price Section.
	   
(A) Provide a complete design for the proposed VoIP system.  The complete design must be based on the technical requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) document, Appendix A, DoDIIS VoIP Technical Requirements, and the following information listed below:

(1) All core VoIP infrastructure hardware, software, and associated licensing cost for 30,000 users (6,000 IP phones per RSC)
(2) Failover architecture for 30,000 IP phones and associated licensing cost
(3) Voice mail for 10,000 users (2,000 users per RSC location)
(4) 2000 IP phones
(5) 2000 IP phone licenses
(6) Annual maintenance cost of all hardware and software 
(7) 24x7 telephonic maintenance support
(8) On-site personnel maintenance support as required
(9) Design and pricing shall not include use of exisitng VoIP GFE for existing operational networks

(B) Insert proposed unit and extended prices for each item in format listed in Appendix B, VOIP Cost Table. The offeror shall include an itemized list of proposed equipment with unit and total pricing. Any offeror, which fails to cite a price for each item, or fails to make an entry, which indicates an item will be provided at no charge, will be rejected as non-responsive to this solicitation.  Only firm-fixed price offers will be evaluated.  

Add Paragraph (l), Government Contract Files, the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals.  Unless the offeror provides written request otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies of such unsuccessful proposals. After contract award, unsuccessful proposals will be destroyed except for one copy, which will be retained with the contract file.  

 (1)  EVALUATION PROCEDURES.
 
(i)  Relevancy:  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  IAW AFFARS 5315.305(a)(2), the main assessment of relevancy focuses on and targets performance relevant to technical capability and price.  Relevancy will also take into account the offeror’s experience in performing similar functions under a single contract.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors’ and teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government will consider an offeror’s contracts in aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three present/past contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant technical effort and/or a relevant price effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when said contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in aggregate, the work more accurately reflects a very relevant effort in terms of technical and/or relevant in price.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

Very Relevant:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires and are currently ongoing or were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date. For example, exceeds total VOIP system IP user deployment (60,000 and above pure IP phones)

Relevant:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires and were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  For example, total VOIP system IP user deployment (50,000-59,000 pure IP phones)

Semi-Relevant: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires and were completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  For example, total VOIP system IP user deployment (30,000-49,000 pure IP phones)

Not Relevant:  None of the above. 

(ii)  Recency:  Present/past performance programs currently ongoing or completed within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date.  Ongoing programs must have started no less than 6 months ago.

(c) Price Factor Assessment:  The offerors deemed technically acceptable will then be ranked according to price, lowest to highest.  This factor will not receive a rating.  
 
(2)  DESCRIPTION OF FACTORS.  

(a)  Description of Factor 1 - Technical Capability:

(1)  The technical team will evaluate the technical proposals based on an acceptable/unacceptable standard.  Discussions/negotiations may be held on technical proposals.  Each technical proposal will be reviewed and a determination shall be made as to whether it is acceptable or unacceptable based on the evaluation criteria described herein.  If a technical proposal is determined unacceptable, the offeror will be excluded from the competition and they will not progress to the next round of evaluations.  

(A)  This factor evaluates the offeror’s proposed technical capability to effectively accomplish the objectives set forth in the SOO.  Note: Evaluation will be based on IP technology only. Other technologies than IP will not be considered.
 
(B)  The standard is met when the contractor demonstrates it products compliance in Appendix A, DODIIS VOIP Technical Requirements.  All requirements will be validated and scored as follows:

EXCELLENT - Exceeds specified capability in a beneficial way to the agency and has a high probability of satisfying the requirement; has no significant weakness.

SATISFACTORY - Meets evaluation standards; has good probability of satisfying the requirement; any weaknesses can be readily corrected.

MARGINAL - Fails to meet evaluation standards; has low probability of satisfying the requirement; has signficant deficiencies.

UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet the minimum requirement.

(b) Description of Factor 2 – Past and Present Performance Factor:

(1)  This factor identifies and reviews relevant present and past performance, and then makes an overall assessment of the Government’s confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the effort described in the RFP, based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The offeror’s proposal shall address performance in related functions of at least three (3), but no more than five (5), of the most relevant current and past contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years of this solicitation closing date in the area of deploying pure IP phones.

(2)  In evaluating this factor, the Government will use the past performance information gathered from offeror(s)' provided references.  Verification of past performance information may be handled telephonically.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to use data independently obtained from other Governmental and commercial sources, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information.
 
(3) Offeror is cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors—Commercial Items.  Offeror’s may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

(c) Description of Factor 3 - Price Factor:
	
(1)  This factor will evaluate the cost proposal to determine the ranking of the proposed total price.

(2)  An offeror’s proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in Appendix B, VOIP Cost Table by the proposed unit price for each contract line item number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each CLIN.   All responsible offers that conform to the solicitation requirements will be ranked according to price, from overall low to high.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>***** Amendment to Solicitation  **** 

The combined synopsis solicitation due date has been extended to March 30, 2005 as a result of questions that have been received in the contracting office.   The questions and answers are as follows:

Question 1:   Can you please specify the supervisory controls of the technician? 

Answer 1:   This is a non-personal service type contract with no Government supervision. The Contractor must work independently based on the tasks and duties described in the SOW.   The Project Officer will be responsible for the contractor completing the work in a competent and timely fashion."

Question 2: Can you please specify the level of the technician? 

Answer 2:  There is no specific "level" for the technician. The contractor shall meet the mandatory requirements and qualifications as identified in the SOW. 

Question 3:  What is the independence and level of involvement in planning and evaluation of laboratory procedures? (specifically in addressing technical problems, modification of methods and design of protocols.) 

Answer 3:  In general the contractor shall work from laboratory protocols and with a high level of independence, in order to meet the needs provided by the project officer and drawn from the tasks listed in the solicitation. The level of independence will vary with the task. For example, media preparation will involve more independence than work with cells destined for patient therapy. In general, the contractor may be involved with addressing selected technical problems but will not be involved with the design and evaluation of new laboratory procedures.

Question 4:   Can we assume that "FAR 52.232.32, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer" should be "FAR 52.232.33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?”
	
Answer 4:   52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3332). 
						
Question 5: Is it safe to assume that the pricing quote to be submitted is the rate per hour since this is an IDIQ type of contract?
								
Answer 5:  Yes				




The original combined synopsis/solicitation entered on 2/15/05 was deleted due to an administrative error in the Classification Code.

<DESC>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS CLAUSE  Purpose:  To provide procedures for obtaining suitability determinations for contractor personnel who will be performing under the contract. Definition:  "Performing under the contract" is defined as either working on-site at an SSA facility (including visiting the SSA site for any reason) or having access to agency programmatic or sensitive information. Suitability factors:  Suitability considerations include: Delinquency or misconduct in prior employment. Criminal, dishonest, infamous, or notoriously disgraceful conduct. The nature and seriousness of the conduct. When the conduct occurred. The applicant's or employee's age at the time of the conduct. The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Intentional false statement, deception, or fraud on application forms.Habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess. Abuse of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances. Reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the individual to the Government of the United States. The kind of position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed. Contributing social and environmental conditions. The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts towards rehabilitation. Authorities: Childcare center security requirements mandated by The Crime Control Act of 1990, Public Law 101-647, subtitle E, as amended by Public Law 102-190.  Personnel security requirements for programmatic and sensitive information are mandated by Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, and Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 731, 732, and 736. Protective security requirements mandated by the General Services Administration (GSA).  Required Forms: 2 completed forms FD-258, "Fingerprint Charts*,"  (The contractor will absorb the costs for obtaining fingerprints.) 1 completed GSA 176, "Statement of Personal History," 1 completed Optional     Form 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment," 1 completed "Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) authorization form**," and For a Non-U.S. citizen, 1 legible photocopy of the work authorization permit and social security card.  * Preprinted with MD900310Z, SOC SEC ADMIN, PROT SEC BR, BALTIMORE, MD on the form. ** The FCRA, as amended on September 30, 1997, requires that the Government notify each applicant, employee, and contractor (in a document consisting solely of the notice) that a consumer report may be used for employment purposes.  The applicant, employee, or contractor must authorize this use in writing before the Government obtains the consumer report.  The FCRA also requires that, before taking adverse action relative to an employment decision based on a consumer report, the agency provide the consumer with a copy of the report, and a copy of the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Rights Notice.  To comply with these requirements, SSA requires that the contractor submit each applicant's or employee's signed FCRA authorization form along with the other investigative documents. Obtaining Forms:  The contracting officer will include a set of the forms with the signed contract. The contractor may contact the Protective Security  Suitability Program Officer (SPO) on (410) 965-4548 for additional forms.  Forms Completion:  The contractor must make sure that all forms are fully completed.  This includes making sure that the Fingerprint charts and Personal History forms are printed legibly or typed in black ink and all signatures are in black ink. Forms Submission:  The contractor must submit the completed forms for each employee and replacement employee (including each subcontractor employee) who will be performing under the contract to the Protective Security Suitability Officer.  The Government will not permit contractor personnel to perform under the contract until the pre-screening process is complete.  See pre-screening below. Cover Letter: The contractor must provide a cover letter listing: The names of employees for whom completed forms are submitted, The contract number; and The contractor's contact name and telephone number. Notes:  (1) The pre-screening process may take up to 15 days.  (2) If contractor personnel will require access to an SSA facility, the contractor should contact the SSA project officer (PO) to obtain a copy of the access procedures.  Also note that some facilities require access forms to be completed and approved after pre-screening is completed but before access.  The access process may take as many as seven days (five working days) at a Headquarter's facility.  For access to a regional or field facility, contact the PO to determine how much time may be needed. The Protective Security Suitability Program Officer’s address is: Social Security Administration Protective Security Suitability Program Officer, Rm 1260 Dunleavy Bldg, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235, Phone:  (410) 965-4548 Note:  The PO needs to know for whom and when the completed forms are submitted.  To accomplish this, when submitting the forms for processing, the contractor must send an e-mail with this information to the PO. Waiver: For contractor employees performing services on-site at an SSA facility up to one day and where access to programmatic or sensitive information is not required, the contractor may request that the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer waive submission of the FD-258s and the Credit Authorization form.  If the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer authorizes a waiver, it will apply only to the one day for which the contractor requested it.  If an individual subsequently performs or is expected to perform additional work, the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer will not approve another waiver.  The contractor must therefore submit the FD-258s and Credit Authorization form. Pre-Screening: The Protective Security Suitability Program Officer will use the information from the completed forms as part of the basis for making a pre-screening determination.  The Protective Security Suitability Program Officer will notify the contractor whether a prospective employee may or may not perform under the contract pending a final suitability determination.  Concurrently, the Protective Security SPO will send a copy of the notification to the CO and PO. Time Frame for Pre-screening The contractor should anticipate that the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer will issue the notification within 15 days after receipt of the properly completed forms. Final Suitability Determination The Protective Security Suitability Program Officer makes the final suitability determination for each contractor employee who does not require access to programmatic or sensitive systems information.  Note:  The Protective Security Suitability Program Officer will provide the contractor a final suitability determination in writing, either favorable or unfavorable, approximately 45 days after submittal of the completed forms.  At the same time, the SPO will notify the CO and PO. The Personnel Security Suitability Program Officer makes the final suitability determination for each contractor employee who does require access to programmatic or sensitive systems information.  Note:  The Personnel Security Suitability Program Officer will provide the contractor a final suitability determination in writing, either favorable or unfavorable, approximately 45 days after submittal of the completed forms. At the same time, the SPO will notify the CO and PO. The Personnel Security Suitability Program Officer’s address is: Social Security Administration, OPE Security and Suitability Staff, Room 1600 Annex, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland  21235, Phone:  (410) 965-0594
Unsuitable Employees: If the Government determines that a contractor employee or applicant is unsuitable, the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer or the Personnel Security Suitability Program Officer will advise the contractor in writing that such employee may not continue to perform or begin performing under the contract.  Concurrently, the Protective Security Suitability Program Officer or Personnel Security Suitability Program Officer will send a copy of the notification to the CO and PO. When the contractor receives the notification, the contractor must immediately remove the employee from performing under the contract.  The contractor must confirm, in writing to the cognizant Suitability Program Officer, the date of the employee’s removal. Concurrently, the cognizant Suitability Program Officer will advise the PO and CO that he has notified the contractor that the proposed contractor personnel have been determined unsuitable/unfit to perform on the contract and must be replaced.  The letter will also request that a replacement(s) be named and the appropriate security forms completed as quickly as possible in order that contract performance will not be adversely impacted.  The Suitability Program Officer's letter will also advise the contractor to contact the CO if there are any contract performance problems related to the removal. Neither the denial resulting from the pre-screening nor the removal of an individual determined unsuitable gives rise to an equitable adjustment under the contract.
Contractor Notification to Government: In the event that contractor personnel performing on this contract either leave the company or are removed from the project, or are arrested or charged with a crime during the term of this contract, the contractor shall notify the Protective Security Officer immediately.  In the notification, the contractor must provide the contractor personnel name(s), SSN, the type of charge(s), the court date, and, if available, the disposition of the charges(s). Duration of Suitability Determination:
The Government must clear each contractor employee, other than a guard, for suitability every five years.  The Government must clear each guard every two years. Government Control: The Government has full control over granting, denying, or withholding access to SSA facilities and for requiring the contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract.  Following a successful pre-screening, the Government will usually permit contractor personnel to work on the contract pending a final suitability determination.  Permitting a contractor employee to work does not assure that a favorable final suitability determination will follow.  This permission to work or issuance of a favorable final suitability determination does not prevent, preclude, or bar the Government from withdrawing or terminating any such permission or suitability determination. REMOVAL FROM DUTY The Government* may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working on the contract should the Government determine that individuals are unfit to perform on the contract.  The contractor must comply with these requests.  The Government's determination of unfit may be made from, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set forth below:  *The contracting officer (CO), with input from the project officer and cognizant Suitability Program Officer, will make all determinations regarding the removal of any employee(s).  In the event of a dispute, the CO will make the final determination.  a. Violation of the Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds, 41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-20.3.  This includes any local badging requirements. b. Neglect of duty, including sleeping while on duty, unreasonable delays or failure to carry out assigned tasks, conducting personal affairs during official time, and refusing to cooperate in upholding the integrity of SSA's security program.  c. Falsification or unlawful concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of any official documents or records, or concealment of material facts by willful omissions from official documents or records.  d. Disorderly conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, quarreling, intimidation by words or actions, or fighting.

<ARCHDATE>05152005
<CONTACT>Brenda Fletcher, 410-278-0876
<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice for solicitation number W91ZLK-05-T-0359 is hereby amended to extend the due date to March 18, 2005.  The following is a list of questions and the answers. Q1. IS THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR A SINGLE UNIT SALE, ONE-OFF SALE, AND/OR DOES IT INFLUENCE ADDITIONAL UNIT SALES POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE? A1. This is a one-time-only purchase of a single unit. Q2. WHAT IS THE APPLICATION WHERE THE CAMERA IS TO BE USED?  FOR EXAMPLE IS IT FOR NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING, FIELD DATA COLLECTION, INFRARED MICROSCOPE, OR LABORATORY E-O STUDIES?  IS IT RELATED TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM, VEHICLE PLATFORM (CURRENT OR FUTURE), O R FOR AN APPLICATION FOR THE US ARMY OTHER THAN IN THE LAB? PLEASE DETAIL MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPE OF APPLICATION. A2. The imager will be used in a wide variety of applications, indoors and outdoors Q3. IS THE UNIT TO BE STIRLING COOLED OR LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED?  A3. Either liquid nitrogen of mechanical cooling is acceptable. Q4. IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPECTRAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENT OF THE 3.7 TO 4.8 MICROMETERS WAVELENGTH RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC SPECTRAL REQUIREMENT OF THE US ARMY OR DUE TO THE SPECTRAL RESPONSE OF THE  MWIR MCT DETECTOR OFFERED BY THE REFERENCED SUPPLIER? IS THE 3.7 TO 4.8 MICROMETER FILTER A FIXED FILTER OR MUST IT OFFER THE OPTION TO BE CHANGED?  WILL OTHER MWIR SPECTRAL RANGES BE CONSIDERED BY THE US ARMY, INCLUDING MWIR InSb (3 TO 5 MICROMETER SPECTRAL BAND) DETECTORS? HAS THE ARMY CONSIDERED THE ATMOSP HERIC EFFECTS AND ATTENUATION PRESENT IN THE CO2 ABSORPTION BAND (APPROX 4.1 MICROMETERS TO 4.5 MICROMETERS) PRESENT IN A DETECTOR WITH A BANDPASS OF ONLY 3.7 TO 4.8 MICROMETERS? A4. The spectral range given is approximate. Any broadband mid wave imager will be considered. Atmospheric attenuation is not important at the ranges commonly used. Q5. THE UNIT REFERENCED APPEARS TO BE A SYSTEM THAT MAY BE DESIGNED AND  MANUFACTURED OFF SHORE IN FRANCE.  GIVEN THE MULTITUDE OF US BASED SUPPLIERS OF MID-WAVE INFRARED CAMERAS IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY OR CONSIDERATION FOR CAMERAS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THE DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY IS DESI GNED, CONTROLLED, AND SUPPORTED BY A FACTORY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES?  IS THERE SOME SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR A SPECIFIC FEATURE WITH REGARD TO THIS PARTICULAR REFERENCED UNIT THAT MAKES IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE US ARMY AS THE REFERENCE CAMERA TO BID AN EQU IVALENT? A5 The Army intends to purchase a large format thermal imager with a minimum detector pitch. Any manufacturer worldwide will be considered. The reference one is distributed by companies in the United States. Q6 ARE OTHER FOCAL PLANE ARRAY FORMATS ACCEPTABLE OTHER THAN 640 X 480?  Q7 WHAT IS THE US ARMY REQUIREMENT FOR A 15 MICROMETER DETECTOR PITCH?  FOR EXAMPLE IS THIS FOR AN INFRARED MICROSCOPE APPLICATION WHERE THIS IS NEEDED? WILL OTHER DETECTOR PITCH SPECIFICATIONS BE CONSIDERED? A6&7  The 640 x 480 pixel format and 15 micron detector pitch are important specs that affect image size and quality, and must be met.
