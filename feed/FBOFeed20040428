<DESC>The proposed contract is for a sole source lease with Morehouse School of Medicine located in Atlanta, Georgia.  The property sought is located at 1513 East Cleveland Avenue, East Point, Georgia.  Located at this facility will be a Community Based Outpatient Clinic that will be operated in conjunction with Morehouse School of Medicine.  The use of sole source selection on the proposed contract requirements is due to the vast resources that Morehouse School of Medicine has to offer in the treatment of Veteran patients and teaching opportunities for it’s students.  The location will provide 10,000 square feet of clinical space next to a building that will have several access points to a building already occupied by Morehouse School of Medicine.  The co-location of the VA CBOC with the Morehouse Medical Campus allows for increased flexibility regarding clinical coverage, teaching appointments, student teaching, joint research endeavors, and supplying Board Certified Attending physicians to the clinic.  The location of the proposed lease space to the Morehouse School of Medicine will make it possible for the sharing of computerized medical records, preventive treatment methods, and easy transporting of veteran patients between the two facilities.  Our requirements are that Morehouse School of Medicine will provide the clinic with medical students, Board Certified Attending physicians, be part of a clinical team, and provide general medical care to a cadre of eligible veterans at one convenient location for the veteran and the medical staff.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement listed above by May 10, 2004.  However, all responses received within the time frames of this notice will be reviewed for the ability to supply our requirements, but does not obligate the government of change from a sole source requirement to a competitive requirement.

<DESC>Introduction:

The U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) collects detailed population and housing data to produce estimates of socioeconomic characteristics.  The data provided by the ACS throughout the decade corresponds to the data that the U.S. Census Bureau historically collected once every ten years during the decennial census. The Census Bureau began a full operational test of the ACS in four counties in October 1995 and added new counties each year through 2000.  Beginning in July 2004, we plan to expand the ACS by selecting an independent sample of approximately 240,000 addresses each month from all counties in the United States.  

Synopsis of Requirement:

The Census Bureau has a requirement for a contractor to use Census Bureau-provided rules to match approximately 240,000 sample addresses provided by the Census Bureau against the contractor=s address database to obtain a published telephone number for as many of the sample addresses as possible.  The contractor will be required to perform an exact match on basic street address, and, where present, on unit designation. The Census Bureau may require more than one contractor to match the same set of addresses because a second contractor may successfully match an address that the first contractor could not.  

The contractor will be required to provide the Census Bureau with a file in ASCII format of addresses (including ZIP+4) and matching current telephone numbers. The Census Bureau will determine the monthly file delivery schedule. 

Title 13 of the United States Code protects the confidentiality of the address information provided by the Census Bureau. Therefore, the contractor must perform the match in a pre-approved secured computer environment and return the original Census Bureau files. The contractor cannot retain a copy of the Census Bureau file or the information it contains. 

The solicitation is scheduled for release on May 14, 2004.  See the solicitation for further details, including additional IT security requirements.

<DESC>The applicable NAICS Code is 611430, $6 million. The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for the presentation of our existing 3-day Course #310108 – Federal Lands 101. Revisions to course materials may be required from time to time. The FHWA is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and economy of the Nation's highway transportation system. The FHWA oversees all phases of highway policy, planning, research, design, operations, construction, and maintenance. There are two principal programs that accomplish this vital task. 

The Federal Aid Highway Program offices, in cooperation with the State Departments of Transportation, administer the nation's comprehensive highway system. The Federal Lands Highway Program (FLHP), as an adjunct to the Federal-Aid Highway Program, covers highway programs in cooperation with Federal land managing agencies. It provides transportation-engineering services for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges providing access to federally owned lands. The Federal Lands Highway organization also provides training, technology, deployment, engineering services, and products to other customers. 

The FHWA administers the Federal Lands Highway Program, including survey, design and construction of forest highway system roads, parkways and park roads, Indian reservation roads, defense access roads, and other Federal lands roads. 

The FHWA, through cooperative agreements with Federal land managing agencies such as the National Park Service, Forest Service, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, administers a coordinated Federal lands-program consisting of forest highways, public lands highways, park roads and parkways, refuge roads, and Indian reservation roads. This program provides funding for more than 90,000 miles of federally owned and public authority-owned roads that serve Federal lands. The Agency's Federal Lands Highway Office provides program coordination, administration and design, and construction engineering assistance and directs the conduct of transportation planning and engineering studies.

With the passage of the Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21), the program for Federal Lands Highway (FLH) nearly doubled and there is the prospect that it will again increase under pending transportation reauthorization. This coupled with the increasing demand by our partners and customers for more technical assistance and the smaller pool of college graduates from which to select, the FLH has been hiring more mid-career professionals. While their technical skills are excellent, their knowledge of the Federal Lands operation is generally minimal. 

To address these needs, the Federal Lands 101 FHWA (Course # 310108), was developed in 2003. The overall course objective was to develop a course that describes how FLH operates in order to (1) administer programs, (2) deliver projects, (3) develop and transfer technology and (4) provide external training. The targeted audience is new hires to the Federal Land Highway in all positions and grades, Federal-Aid employees and Federal Lands Management Agency employees upon request. The training includes a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, and group exercises/discussions. The case studies and exercises are transportation-related, highway-industry related and intermodal in scope.

The contractor must incorporate the latest accepted Instructional System Design (ISD) using adult learning techniques in the development of course materials and instruction. Normally, there will be a FLH instructor in attendance who works with the contractor instructor throughout the course to provide the Federal perspective and the latest policies and regulations that may impact the content of the course. However, the contractor shall provide skilled, competent, knowledgeable, credible, instructors with adult education experience capable of successfully teaching the course even without the assistance of a FLH instructor.

Extensive information on Federal Lands Highway can be accessed through the website http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Note: this is not a solicitation for acquiring services to coordinate, organize or operate conferences and/or workshops.   Rather, it is an effort to provide support to established conferences and workshops from recognized scientific, technical, or professional organizations that qualify for federal tax-exempt status of which the subject matter of the conference or workshop is scientific, technical, or involves professional issues that are relevant to the AFRL/VS mission for applied research and technology development programs relating to space systems and technology.  

The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) understands that it is essential for the scientific community to maintain clear lines of communication for thorough and well-reasoned science to be accomplished.  Conferences and workshops have proven to be an extremely valuable tool for DOD.  They allow technical managers the opportunity to receive prevailing information on their respective disciplines.  They also will allow AFRL/VS the opportunity to inform the scientific community of the current thrust of VS programs.  Conferences and workshops constitute a key forum for scientific and technology interchange.  AFRL/VS encourages proposals from recognized scientific, technical, or professional organizations that qualify for federal tax-exempt status.  AFRL/VS financial support through appropriate assistance instruments for conferences and workshops is dependent on the availability of funds, program manager’s discretion, and certain other restrictions.  Other restrictions include:  AFRL/VS support for a workshop or conference is not to be considered as government endorsement of any sponsoring non-profit organization.  The subject matter of the conference or workshop is scientific, technical, or involves professional issues that are relevant to the AFRL/VS mission for applied research and technology development programs relating to space systems and technology.  The purpose of this solicitation is to stimulate transfer of federally developed technology to the private sector or create wider interest and inquiry into the relevant scientific, technical, or professional issues relevant to the AFRL/VS mission.  Submissions will be accepted throughout the year, but not later than 60 days before the first day of the conference/workshop, which is proposed to be funded by AFRL/VS.  The following technical proposal preparation instructions apply:  Proposals should include the following:  1. Summary indicating the objective(s) of the conference/workshop topic(s) to be covered and how they are relevant to the AFRL/VS mission of programs relating to space components, sensors and systems. 2. Title, location, and date(s) of the conference/workshop. 3.

Anticipated use of funds requested from AFRL/VS (Note: AFRL/VS funds may not be used to support or assist participants from communist countries or to pay any federal government employee support, subsistence, or fee in connection with the conference/workshop).  Proposals for conferences and workshops will be evaluated by a peer and scientific review process in accordance with the following evaluation criteria: Factors 1-4 are of equal importance to each other. 1. The scientific and technical relevance of the proposed conference; 2. The potential contributions of the proposed conference to the mission of AFRL/VS; 3. The qualifications of the proposed speaker(s) appearing at the conference or workshop; and 4. Utilization of funds requested from AFRL/VS.  In addition to complying with proposal requirements listed above, proposals should comply with the Assistance Cost Proposal Instructions, Non-FAR Certifications, and Proposal Preparation Instructions (Attachments posted).

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, has issued a solicitation Request for Proposals (RFP), with all attachments only available from the Electonic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov/, and intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on or about 01 October 2004. The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 (21 million). This solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer are identified in the solicitation. The Government contemplates award of this requirement on or about 15 August 2004, with a performance start date of 01 October 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as information only and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The Statement of Work (SOW), Work Allocation Table, DD Form 254, and Past Performance Questionnare are attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) one of the POC(s) listed below.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Industry Day.

On Thursday, March 11, 2004, the United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the construction phase of a new United States District Courthouse.  The Industry Day will be conducted from 2:15 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Room 501B of The McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S.

The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is $88,000,000 and most perspective General Contractors (GC's) are expected to be represented.

The Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have expressed interest as the prospective GC's for this project.

-again, no later than COB November 4, 2003. Late and/or incomplete submissions for all stages will be handled in accordance with FAR Part 52.214-7, which may render an offeror ineligible for further participation. STAGE-II-Offerors successfully responding accordingly to the Stage I requirements will be forwarded a Request For Proposal (RFP) package requesting both technical and price proposal (based on approximately 25% to 35% A-E design documents) to be submitted each under separate cover and in the requested format. Technical data shall be submitted in an 8-1/2" x 11" spiral bound format that chronologically responds to the following five (5) evaluation factors: (1) Past Performance on same or similar projects (2) Past Experience on same or similar projects.

The RFP package will also contain information relevant to the date, time and place of a site visit, pre-proposal conference and a Socio-Economic Program Meeting (networking session), which will be scheduled to entertain inquiries concerning the scope of work and related issues. The networking session will allow for the marketing and exchange of information with small businesses with potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing opportunities, business ventures and or teaming arrangements. The Government will also require the submission of a Subcontracting Plan pursuant to FAR Part 19.705-4 with Stage II price proposal submission from each large business encompassing the Socio-Economic Program goals: Total Small Businesses (50%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (12%), Small Women-Owned Businesses (5%), Service-Disabled Veteran (3%) and HubZone (3%).

Noncompliance with the established time frames for any and all submissions will be handled in accordance with FAR Part 15.215-1 and may result in the offeror's disqualification from further participation in this procurement. Electronic transmissions and faxes are not permitted for proposal submissions at any stage of this process.

<SUBJECT>B--MMS Peer-Reviewed Publications From the Environmental Studies Program:  A Comphrehensive Annotated Bibliography
<SOLNBR>0104RP35054
<RESPDATE>051904
<ARCHDATE>04282005
<CONTACT>Debra M. Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     Debra.Bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, intends to competitively award a contract for "MMS Peer-Reviewed Publications from the Environmental Studies Program:  A Comprehensive, Annotated Bibliography."  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541710 - Electronic Research and Development Laboratories or Services, with a size standard of 500 employees.  BACKGROUND:  The MMS has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  In 1953, the OCS Lands Act (67 Stat. 462) established Federal jurisdiction over the submerged lands of the continental shelf seaward of State boundaries.  The Act charged the Secretary of the Interior with the responsibility for administering minerals exploration and development of the OCS.  It also empowered the Secretary to formulate regulations so that the provisions of the Act might be met.  The OCS Lands Act (OCSLA) Amendments of 1978 (92 Stat. 629) established a policy for the management of oil and natural gas in the OCS and for protection of the marine and coastal environments.  The amendments authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies in areas or regions of sales to ascertain the "environmental impacts on the marine and coastal environments of the outer Continental Shelf and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas development." (43 U.S.C. 1346).  Studies of the marine and coastal environment have resulted in nearly 3,000 published reports.  These reports are produced as gray literature, that is, reports that have not been widely published through books or journals.  The gray literature reports are what are typically required as deliverables for MMS contracts.  Once the contract has been completed, the research investigators are free (and encouraged) to publish their findings in more widespread journals and other publications.  These journals and publications are more difficult to track since these are typically prepared once a contract has been completed and there is no longer formal communication between the research investigators and the MMS.  The last time that a concerted effort was made to identify publications in refereed peer-reviewed journals that were based on MMS sponsored research was 1993 (Tetley and Wells, 1993).  This effort contained only the bibliographic information for the articles and produced a database which can link to similar databases containing contractual and final deliverable information.  This database was incorporated into the MMS Oracle corporate database.  A similar effort, started under the MMS Universities Research Initiative (URI), generated bibliographic information relating to offshore oil and gas development in the form of a quarterly, hard-copy annotated report.  This database compilation continued for the 5-year duration of the URI.  A continuation of this compilation is being done under the MMS-Louisiana State University Coastal Marine Institute program.  Information in this latest effort is formatted and searchable on the Internet; however, it does not indicate which articles are based on MMS research. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:  This project is to identify and make available an annotated bibliography of peer-reviewed publications based on MMS Environmental Studies Program (ESP) research.  Identifying and annotating peer-reviewed publications based on MMS ESP studies will help Government and industry focus quickly on information collected specifically for the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas, and marine minerals activities.  Additionally, one of the Department of the Interior goals is to have all science independently evaluated.  Compiling MMS peer-reviewed publications will aid in achieving this goal and maintaining the credibility of MMS science.  The intent is to incorporate the results into the MMS corporate database and to also make the results available through the Internet accessible ESPIS database.  ESPIS is an online database powered by Fulcrum technology that incorporates fielded information and associated documents into a fully-searchable, web-enabled database.  Preparing the best bibliography will require that a balance be struck between ferreting out every possible publication and producing complete and concise annotations that will accurately synopsize the publications to help researchers and analysts to find appropriate information.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The bibliography will be compiled by manually and electronically scanning a variety of literature sources as well as contacting contracting officer's technical representatives (COTRs) and principal investigators (PIs) for all MMS ESP contracts (initially focusing on post 1992 contracts).  A list of these COTRs and PIs will be provided to the successful offeror.  Citations and annotations will be broken down by the following subjects: General Science, Biology, Protected Species, Fates and Effects, Chemistry, Physical Oceanography, Air Quality, Geology, Social Science, Work Shops, and Other for any miscellaneous publications that do not fit into the specific categories.  An annotated bibliography will be made available in electronic format that will complement the ESP reports that are currently available via the Internet.  In addition to complete bibliographic information (Author, Address of Author, Calendar Year Published, Title, Journal, Volume, Issue, Pages, Date, Topic, Keywords, MMS Contract Number(s) for original work, Study Area, MMS Region), each citation shall include an annotation that addresses its background (e.g., why the referenced study was initiated, the affiliation of principal investigators, etc.), years covered by research and study area, objectives, methodology (e.g., sampling frame, procedures, etc.), and significant findings and conclusions.    The period of performance of this effort is expected to be a maximum of 18 months.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract with a Not to Exceed cost of $99,000.00 will be awarded.  DELIVERABLES:  Work products will include a digital copy in a publishable format of the annotated bibliography (preferably Adobe pdf); a fielded digital database compatible with existing MMS bibliographic databases for incorporation into existing MMS bibliographic databases (Oracle, Fulcrum, ProCite, and EndNote); an electronic report describing the sources of information and procedures used to develop the bibliography as well as describing the database fields and structure, an electronic technical summary of the project, and copies of all peer-reviewed journal articles that are obtained for this project.  TO RESPOND:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement not later than 3:00 p.m. E.T. on May 19, 2004, describing in detail (A) Key personnel who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project, with their qualifications, specific expertise, and experience; (B) The organization's experience with this type of work and a description of your facilities.  Specifically, we will look at your ability to timely complete projects, adhere to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of costs controls, and quality of products delivered; degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, and size.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources capable of performing research, development and program analysis support services for the Atmosphere & Space (A&S) Division (TTA) of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) in support of the United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System (USNDS) space and atmospheric mission.

BACKGROUND: AFTAC/TTA supports the overall AFTAC mission through the operation of the Nuclear Detonation(NUDET) Detection System (NDS) to detect, locate, identify, determine the yield of, and report in near-real-time all atmospheric and space NUDETs.  AFTAC/TTA also performs detailed analyses of data collected by these detection systems.

TTA is responsible for collecting and exploiting satellite-borne remote sensor data and providing national command authorities with nuclear weapon explosion data.  TTA is also AFTAC’s command-lead for consolidation of A&S operational requirements.  They develop and implement plans to meet operational requirements through the deployment of space-based sensors and associated ground processing equipment.  The space-based sensors used to collect data include Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) sensor suites hosted on Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and NDS sensor suites hosted on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, among others.  The ground data processing systems used include the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the AFTAC Low Intensity Signal Event (ALISE) processor, the NDS Analysis Package (NAP) ground segment, the Advanced RADEC Data Units (ARDUs), several classified systems, and the A&S Local Area Network (LAN). These satellite/sensor/ground data processing systems are collectively labeled the United States NUDET Detection System (USNDS).  This unique national asset provides the only US global detection capability for atmospheric and space NUDETs.

To perform its mission, TTA maintains a data processing and storage capability on a distributed client-server automated information system called the A&S LAN.  Additionally, they develop and maintain data analysis software to support A&S mission operations.  The use of contractor support provides a structured and documented approach for collecting valid user requirements, and the requirements identified by the users provide feedback for continued software process improvements.  A past consolidation of analysis techniques and algorithms has created seven functionally-unique software applications, each with a standardized Graphical User Interface (GUI).  This set of software applications represent the core of TTA’s analysis capabilities and are named QUERY, CAPTOOL, CAPFAST, DISPLAY, HEALTHTOOL, SIMTOOL, and TAOTOOL.  As algorithms, techniques, weapon and sensor designs, evasion scenarios, and data sources evolve or expand, TTA must remain the primary NUDET investigator for the USNDS.
	
CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and other services necessary to perform the work specified above.  The majority of the work will be performed at AFTAC/TTA, Patrick AFB, FL.  Specifically, the contractor shall perform the following activities: algorithm development; Research and Development (R&D); event characterization process improvement; continued A&S analysis program development and/or expansion; requirements capture; functional design of capabilities for analysis applications; “on-line” help documentation update and/or creation for application software; new data source incorporation into software and data processing baselines; software configuration and control, software validation and testing; technical evaluation of software and database test procedures; promote the transition of software and data; training of TTA personnel in the use of new or revised applications; user-training materials update; on-line TTA analysis tools upgrade and maintenance; technical meeting attendance/participation, and A&S LAN change documentation.

Additionally, the contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of requirements analysis and the ability to assess system and operational documentation to support TTA decision-making. The contractor shall define a structured and documented approach for collecting requirements identified by users to provide feedback for software process improvements. All TTA decision support functions other than those precluded from being contracted (policy-making and financial control) are within the scope of this effort. The TTA assessment process requires definition and/or clarification of space and ground data processing requirements, generation of cost/benefit trade studies to evaluate system alternatives to meet validated requirements, and conduct of operational assessments. The products from this support include capability analyses, feasibility studies, risk analyses, operational analyses, and new program initiatives.

Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of nuclear weapon phenomenology, extensive knowledge of satellite sensor operation and associated data processing, a working knowledge of both PC and UNIX operating systems, and an ability to program in C++ and other languages. Contractor personnel should also possess an ability to adapt to new sensor systems and ground processing systems while maintaining the TTA Legacy data. (Current TTA system has approximately 3 million lines of code hosted on an Oracle database that requires management and real-time updating.) It is imperative that no loss of analytical capability occurs between the current support effort and this proposed support effort.

Contractor’s experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted AFTAC A&S mission, therefore a history of relevant work is required.  Key contractor personnel should possess experience and have the ability to use the Atmospheric and Space analysis tools and applications discussed above.   Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in  performing software validation and testing in the AFTAC/TTA mission areas outlined above is required.

Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to TOP SECRET/SCI is required. Storage and Facility clearances of at least the TOP SECRET/SCI level are required.  

This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more that 20 pages and should address the following specific areas:

1.  The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract.
2.  The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit.
3.  Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above.
4..  Business size/status.


A cost plus fixed fee contract is contemplated with a 1 year base period and 4 one year options.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Responses may be mailed to 45CONS/LGCCB, Attn: James Loeffler, 1030 S. HWY A1A, Bldg 989, MS 1000, Patrick AFB, FL, 32925-3002.  Responses may also be e-mailed to james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil.  Questions may also be e-mailed to this address.  Responses are due no later than 12 March 2003.

<DESC>BODYWORN TACTICAL DIRECTION FINDING SYSTEM

The US Special Operations Command urgently requires a bodyworn tactical radio direction finding (DF) system to provide threat warning. The primary purpose of the system is to provide the individual in a tactical environment warning of threats using handheld commercial and military push-to-talk radios, cellular telephones, vehicular radios, and fixed site radios. The DF antenna design should use the latest technology including fractals, patches/micro-patches, variable slot, tuned diodes, and other not mentioned technologies, or any combination of technologies, for the sensing of radio frequency (RF) energy.  The desired frequency range of the system is 30 MHz to 3 GHz.
The antenna should be omni-directional with a uniform gain (within 3 dB) in all directions and have a VSWR less than 1.2:1 across the frequency band.  The antenna should be configured into a vest, jacket, or externally worn web harness and may contain multiple antennas.  The vest/jacket/harness should carry/contain a small, low power, high dynamic range preamplifier(s) for the LVHF band and above that can be turned on/off and powered through the RF connection to the receiver(s).  The receiver(s) should be low cost, small, lightweight, and capable of scanning for RF energy across one or more frequency bands, but the system must cover the total bands of interest, 30 MHz to 3 GHz.  The system must have a minimum of two coherent local oscillators (LO) (three LO, or two LO and a third tuner preferred) with IF output for DF applications.  The system must provide for the optional presentation of intercepted signal audio to an operator earpiece.
The system should be controlled by a PDA or bodyworn computer using the MS Windows CE or Windows XP (preferred) operating system.  The system should archive a minimum of six hours of  tabular intercept/DF data for post mission exploitation.  The system must be capable of fully automated or manually initiated DF at the operator’s option.  The system must be capable of directed search using a threat signal list.  The system must be capable of audible alarm in the operator earpiece upon RF energy detection, with alarm volume control and on/off switch.
The system should be able to perform DF lines of bearings (LOB) to 15 degrees RMS accuracy,+/- five degrees.  The system must not weigh more than 15 pounds (less batteries), with 10 pounds the goal.  The system must not consume more than 15 Watts of battery power.  The system will be powered by 12 Volt military lithium chemistry battery.  The goal is to operate the system for six hours on a maximum of two 12 Volt batteries. Interested vendors are requested to send White Papers concerning a system design proposal or existing system specifications and a price list to US Special Operations Command, Program Executive Officer for Information and Intelligence Systems, ATTN: Mr. Richard Bodkin, 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd, Suite 900, Tampa  FL 33609.

SENIOR COMPETITIVENESS ADVISOR

ARTICLE I - STATEMENT OF DUTIES

A.	Background

Competitiveness theory and competitiveness initiatives are not new.  For at least the last decade, governments, industry representatives and research institutions have collaborated to develop productive linkages among enterprises within an industry sector, or “cluster”.  At a recent conference, The Competitiveness Institute (TCI) presented summary data on experiences and lessons learned from over 260 competitiveness initiatives. Although largely limited to the developed world economies, industrial clusters and cluster initiatives have become integral to regional and national economic development plans.
 
What is new is the application of competitiveness theory and cluster initiatives in development, specifically in building economic clusters in transitioning and developing economies.  Although a few transition economies were represented in TCI data, developing countries were glaringly underrepresented.  

In a 2002 presentation to USAID staff, Dr. Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School outlined the competitiveness challenges faced by developing countries.  Among these are: unstable macroeconomic environments; unsophisticated local demand; small local markets with heavy price sensitivity; strong government intervention in competition; focus on low-skill, low cost labor; and weak supporting industries.  Porter stressed that despite these challenges, developing countries have the potential to utilize competitiveness theory to their advantage.
 
Since the early ‘80s when the Agency placed greater emphasis on private sector development as an economic driver, many USAID programs have stressed increasing competitiveness and productivity of private sector firms.  Dr. Porter’s work provided a framework that allowed USAID to organize its competitiveness efforts and approach competitiveness in a more systematic, participatory manner.  As the recognized leader supporting competitiveness in developing countries, USAID has already invested $57 million in 26 initiatives worldwide.
 
USAID has taken a proactive role in integrating competitiveness theory and application into economic growth activities within the Agency.  In 2002, the EGAT Bureau hired the Mitchell Group to conduct an overview study of competitiveness in transitioning and developing countries. Additionally, through its on-going competitiveness initiatives, USAID and its partners will contribute to the knowledge base by determining which aspects of competitiveness theory are applicable in differing development contexts, and how cluster approaches need to be modified to be more effective in developing and transitioning economies.

B.	Objective 

The Senior Competitiveness Advisor will provide guidance on the strategy development, design, implementation, coordination, and supervision of USAID-financed competitiveness initiatives in Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union.  

C.	General Duties

This scope of work (SOW) defines the general duties of a personal services contractor (PSC, or the "Contractor") to provide technical expertise to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT).  The general duties are to assist in the design, implementation and monitoring of competitiveness initiatives in the countries of the Europe and Eurasia (E&E) Region.  This PSC will bring project conceptualization and design skills to bear on these priority programs which are outside the scope of E&E/EG staff and are not otherwise available within the Agency.

The Contractor will be based in Washington, D.C., will be incorporated into the staff of the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade Office for Economic Growth, but will work exclusively on E&E matters. The PSC will formally report to the Chief of EGAT/EG/EDFM.

Specific Duties and Responsibilities

The general scope of activities of the Contractor will be to provide overall intellectual and technical guidance to help design, implement and monitor the Region’s Competitiveness programs.  Specific tasks will cover, but not be limited to, the following:

<DESC>This document is a Request for Information (RFI) from industry, academia, and other Government agencies at all levels to obtain information on environmental emergency response and cleanup services.  Your responses are strictly voluntary.  If you wish your response to be treated as confidential, you must mark it as such, employing language such as trade secret, proprietary, or company confidential.  If you do so, EPA will regard it as entitled to confidential treatment and it will not be disclosed by EPA without your consent, unless its disclosure is duly ordered by a Federal court, which is highly unlikely under the circumstances. BACKGROUND 	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been delegated the responsibility to undertake assessments and response actions with respect to the release or threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.  In addition, the EPA has the authority pursuant to Emergency Support Function (ESF) #10 and other laws to help and/or mitigate endangerment of the public health, welfare or environment during emergencies or natural disasters and to support states and communities in preparing for responses to releases of oil, petroleum products and hazardous substances and to  provide response and removal services in response to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction, acts of terrorism, and nuclear, biological and chemical incidents and Federally Declared Disaster incidents. 	While EPA Region III Superfund Program, Emergency Response and Site Cleanup Services (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia) has traditionally contracted for the full range of services to support our mission under the above authorities, we are attempting to better prepare to meet today's challenges,  particularly the need for preparedness for counter-terrorism response.  Accordingly we are  requesting input from anyone with an interest in this area.   	EPA Region III would appreciate if you would take some time and answer the questions below.  We are interested in your responses and hope that utilizing some of your advice, we can better support our contractual requirements.  We would appreciate if you could provide your answers back to Alexandra Rajkowski, via fax (215) 814-5211, or by E-Mail: rajkowski.alexandra@epa.gov  no later than by May 12, 2004. Level "A" Response ? Any future contract(s) may require level A response capability.  1.  How do you define, or what is the makeup, of your level A entry team?  What do you consider the appropriate support for a level A entry team? 2.  How many level A entry teams do you have or could you anticipate having available for this requirement? 3.  How quickly could you deploy the team(s) within Reg III? /within the US? 4.  What type of annual training and drills do you do for your level A personnel? 5.   Do you have any other comments or suggestions you would like to add?    WMD Response ? Any future contract(s) will focus heavily on Region III's preparedness for counter-terrorism response which may include biological, chemical and radiological response.  1.  Are you currently prepared to respond to WMD events? 2.  If so, do you train for it?  Do you drill for it? 3.  Do you maintain equipment and supplies for a WMD response? 4. Do you have any comments or suggestions you would like to add to help us better prepare to meet the needs for a WMD response? Equipment Rental Rates ? 1.  Traditionally, we have allowed contractors to bill for each day of equipment rental used on a response.  Are equipment rates handled differently in your commercial contracts, and if so, how? 2.  Do you have discounts for weekly or monthly equipment rental rates? 3.  If so what are they? 4. Do you have another suggestion for structuring the rates for this requirement? Response Time and Personnel Capability  ? anywhere in Region III (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia). 1.  What are the minimum response times you are capable of providing anywhere in Region III? 2.  What is the maximum number of your own personnel you could deploy for a major response (typically the majority of personnel required would be clean up technicians)?  How quickly could you deploy your maximum number of personnel?  How quickly could you deploy 50% of your personnel?    What do think is the maximum number of personnel you could deploy including your subcontractors?  How quickly could you deploy the maximum number of personnel?  4. Would a requirement for a large deployment of personnel affect your rates? 5.  Should the rates be structured differently for a large scale deployment, and if so, what do you suggest?     Contract Minimum - Because we must prepare for a WMD response, we have a potential need for substantial contract capacity. It is likely that any future requirement would be awarded with the intent that the awardee(s)  handle major emergency events or large complicated sites.  Without such an event and with a limited budget it is likely that the awardee(s) could possibly only receive only the contract minimum. 1.  Recognizing the nature of the contract, what dollar minimum would make it worthwhile to bid on this type of requirement? 					 Performance Based Contracting and Incentives - 1.  Is performance based contracting appropriate for this type of work or a portion of this work?  If so, please provide examples of performance based work you have handled or believe could be handled as performance based. 2.  Are incentives appropriate for this type of effort?  If so, which ones would be best and why?

<OFFADD>BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PO BOX 25007, D-7810 DENVER CO 80225
<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Award on a Sole Source Basis.
<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to Award, an advisory and assistance services agreement to William Lettis and Associates (key personnel Dr. Jeffery Unruh), on a Sole Source Basis for the reasons and facts set forth below. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) requires advisory and assistance services as part of the seismic source assessment for a critical infrastructure.  The services include the updating of structural and tectonic models that describe the behavior of potentially seismogenic fault sources within the Coast Range Anticlinorium of a state of interest.  A more detailed statement of Reclamation's requirement is set forth below in the Statement of Work.   Present state-of-practice for earthquake hazard evaluation of high-hazard Reclamation facilities utilizes PSHA (Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment) methodologies.  Primary inputs to the PSHA include the characterization of potential earthquake sources in the region surrounding the site of interest.  Earthquake sources are delineated in terms of their spatial geometry, earthquake mechanisms, probability of activity, and slip rate or activity rate.  These characteristics are defined from historical earthquake and paleoseismic data, geomorphic evidence, structural geology data and interpretations, and regional models of contemporary deformation. A 1994 Seismotectonic Evaluation for the site of interest by William Lettis and Associates identified potential seismic sources, and provided a deterministic assessment of fault activity. Potential seismic sources can be broadly grouped into 1) Cascadia Subduction Zone sources, 2) Coast Range sources, 3) Portland Fold Belt sources, and 4) background and areal source seismicity zones. The 1994 report provided a conceptual model for crustal deformation above the Cascadia Subduction Zone as a framework for understanding the driving mechanisms for earthquake-related deformation near the site of interest. Within the deterministic framework used to evaluate earthquake hazards, the 1994 report detailed characterization of several key structures or model elements were not required because the maximum ground motions at the site of interest would be equaled or exceeded by motions from other known sources such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  However, within the PSHA framework used in present evaluations, the relative rate of activity and proximity of seismic sources to the site of interest are critical factors in the evaluations. Thus, additional characterizations of potential seismic sources near the site of interest are required, in particular for potential seismic sources within the Coast Range Anticlinorium. Drs. Jeffery Unruh and William Lettis are established experts in the field of seismic hazard assessment of faults, with particular expertise in evaluating "blind" thrust faults. They were the primary technical staff responsible for the existing assessment put forward in the 1994 report which is in need of updating. They possess detailed prior knowledge of the study area and the problems involved in evaluating the structural and seismogenic issues associated with potential seismic sources in the region. Dr. Jeffery R. Unruh is a widely recognized expert in paleoseismology and in the geomorphic and structural evaluation of potentially active faults, in particular for the evaluation of "blind" or concealed thrust fault.  He has been highly involved in numerous similar projects that involve characterization of blind thrust faults for deterministic and probabilistic hazard assessments.  Dr. Unruh and his employer, William Lettis and Associates conducted the original work characterizing the seismotectonics of the critical infrastructure's region within the deterministic framework used by Reclamation in 1994.  Thus, he has a thorough understanding of the limitations and scope of the previous deterministic studies and how these studies and models can be used in the current probabilistic compressional regimes make him uniquely qualified for this study.  Finally, he is familiar with the seismotectonics of the study area because he conducted extensive field reconnaissance of that area as part of the 1994 study.   Concerns having the ability to furnish the following supplies, and services are requested to give written notification, including, a telephone number for a POC to the acquisition office listed in this notice within 5 calendar days from the date of synopsis. Interested concerns must have expertise in paleoseismology and in the geomorphic and structural evaluation of "blind" or concealed thrust faults; have project experience that involved characterizations of blind thrust faults for deterministic and probabilistic hazard assessments; and be capable of providing seismic source assessment for the site of interest and have experience performing all tasks set forth in the Scope of Work on similar projects. STATEMENT OF WORK 1.   Work to be performed By Contractor. Tasks to be completed by the Contractor are as follows: (1). Update the structural and seismotectonic setting of the site of interest within the framework of contemporary upper plate deformation associated with the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Emphasize identifying structures within the Coast Range anticlinorium that may be distinct seismogenic features.  (a). Assess and evaluate the tectonic context of the Coast Range Anticlinorium relative to other upper plate structures. Assess potential kinematic connections between potentially seismogenic structures within the Coast Ranges with other zones of contemporary deformation such as the Portland Hills fold belt.  (2). Update and evaluate the conceptual model of crustal deformation within the Coast Ranges developed in the 1994 Seismotectonic Evaluation. (a).Define the extent and boundaries of contemporary deformation subprovinces in the site of interest region of the Coast Ranges (b). Draw crustal scale cross section(s) through the region to show structure, dimensions, and relationship of the Coast Range Anticlinorium to the subducting Juan de Fuca plate. (c). Define the extent and boundaries of contemporary deformation subprovinces within the Coast Range anticlinorium and identify general categories of potentially seismogenic structures within each subprovince.  (3). Evaluate the potential for buried (blind) seismic sources beneath the Coast Range anticlinorium as depicted in the 1994 Seismotectonic Evaluation. (4). Recommend fault characterization parameters for potential seismic sources within the Coast Range anticlinorium. (5). Identify additional investigations that may provide additional information to reduce uncertainty in earthquake source characterizations that are potentially significant to evaluations at the site of interest. (6). Document results from tasks 1-5 in draft report for Reclamation review. (7). Provide briefing in Denver to D8330 technical staff regarding findings and draft report. (8). Provide final report incorporating review comments on draft report and results from discussions with Reclamation staff into final report. 2. Government-Furnished Material/Data and Facilities.   D-8330 will provide conference rooms for briefing and discussions and miscellaneous technical data and reports needed for the study.   3. Project Completion/Delivery Schedule.  A draft report should be supplied by the contractor by August 15, 2004.  Technical briefing should be completed by August 31, 2004. Final comments from Reclamation on the draft report will be provided by September 3, 2004. A final report will be due by September 20, 2004.  Therefore, based on the facts above, it is Reclamation's belief that William Lettis and Associate (key personnel Dr. Jeffery R. Unruh) is the only source capable of providing the services required.  This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall provide detailed data concerning their capabilities and may request to receive a copy of the solicitation when, and if it becomes available.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.  See Note 22.    Please address questions or comments to the Bureau of Reclamation, attention John Collins, Fax: 303/445-6345.

<SUBJECT>56 -- Request for Information (Market Survey)
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (MARKET-SURVEY)

REQUEST:
This is a market survey, requesting feedback, comments, or suggestions from contractors on a new “standard” window size that the US Department of State (Department) will be using on the bulk of it’s future projects.  The Department is planning to implement this standardization this year. Therefore, please submit your input to this request within Fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. 
BACKGROUND:
The Department is in the midst of a massive building campaign where we are providing new US Embassies to replace unsafe and obsolete facilities worldwide.  One aspect of this program is a Standard Embassy Design that allows the Department to complete these facilities quickly, and efficiently.  One issue that the Department noted in the past is lack of a standard design for the fenestration products, which led to longer lead-times and difficulty in installation.  
In an effort to standardize, the fenestration for use in the Standard Embassy Design, Department is proposing to use a 1500mm wide by 2625mm high outside frame dimension for all exterior windows.  However, a 1500mm wide by 2625mm high outside frame would have to be Force Entry/ Ballistic Resistant (FE/BR) certified using the ASTM UL or the Department’s testing standards.  If you would like to get your product tested you can contact Mr. Les Roane of H.P. White Laboratories at (410) 838-6550 or you can go on the Internet at info@hpwhite.com. The Department is also considering using a 1500mm by 2250mm frame for the FE/BR windows, which would have to be certified, as an alternate, to the 1500mm wide by 2625mm high.  These windows will be configured into groups for most elevations and into ribbon windows for the atrium ends. 
The Department is planning to specify this change in window sizing beginning with the planned 2004 projects.  In future years, the Department will bulk-purchase these windows.
QUESTIONS:
What is the impact, from your perspective, of this new standard window dimensions?  Will it save manufacturing time and expense? Will the quality of the products be impacted?

Thank you for your assistance.

<SUBJECT>D -- Software engineering/redesign of CLASS, DMSP, and Nighttime Lights for NESDIS
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) has a requirement for the redesign of the software on the Comprehensive Large Array-data StewardShip (CLASS) program, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and Nighttime Lights software engineering work for the National Environmental, Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). This is a critical component of NGDC's contribution to ongoing CLASS and Homeland Security efforts.  Operational Systems, Incorporated's (OSI) extensive experience working on these projects and it's intimate knowledge of the software systems that underlie these systems make it the sole source capable for these projects. OSI's developers designed and built the system that ingests, processes, and archives all DMSP data for NGDC's DMSP Digital Archive.  OSI has continued to maintain and evolve this 24x7 operational system since its deployment in 1992.  As the initial authors of this system, OSI is the only source able to maintain and evolve the code over the fourteen years of its existence. OSI's developers have been instrumental in updating and modernizing many of the key components of NGDC's DMSP nighttime lights processing system and the DMSP Nighttime Lights Film Scan Project, which is an effort to use DMSP film scan imagery in support of  Homeland Security objectives.  This system uses the data of the DMSP Digital Archive.  OSI's knowledge of the basic processing system for the Remote Sensing Group comprises one and one-half years, and OSI has re-written much of the fundamental code.  As part of this effort, OSI has also written a system to produce digital output similar to that of the DMSP Digital Archive from analog DMSP film scans. OSI has been working on the CLASS project since NGDC's initial active involvement began in the summer of 2002.  OSI has the knowledge of the installation of the CLASS software and systems, integration with current DMSP processing systems (in particular, DDABasic), and participated in the development of the next generation CLASS architecture.  The Nighttime Lights Project will provide intelligence information based on DMSP nighttime observations to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and others.  In order to meet its goals in this area, NGDC must use programmers knowledgeable in the DMSP F-16 spacecraft and film scan imagery, involvement in the extension of the current DMSP data processing system, and DDABasic to handle new instrument types and data available from the spacecraft in the support of  Homeland Security objectives.  This spacecraft is already sending data to NGDC (Oct 03, 2004 launch).  The three systems involved, Nighttime Lights, DDABasic, and CLASS,  comprise many hundreds of thousands of lines of custom C++, C, FORTRAN, Perl, IDL, XML, and Java code.  NGDC is the sole agent for the raw data files from the DMSP satellites, with OSI being the software development team for processing this data.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Operational Systems, Incorporated (OSI) for  the above requirements including two option years, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, for the redesign of the software on the Comprehensive Large Array-data StewardShip (CLASS) program, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and nighttime lights software engineering work. All rights in any type of data, recorded information, or software created under this agreement shall be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.227-17 Rights in Data - Special Works (JUNE 1997). There is no solicitation available.
See Number Note 22 (http://www.fedbizopps.gov), however the 45 days for receipt of response or proposals has been changed to read 15 days.

DESCRIPTION: GEOTECHNICAL TESTING  - ARNOLD BLVD. PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The south half of Arnold Blvd (30’ wide x 6,700’ long) was recently reconstructed.  The reconstruction efforts included replacement of the pavement section - providing new asphalt (2”), new base (10”), and portland cement subgrade stabilization (6”).  However, shortly following pavement reconstruction, many failure areas (potholes and ruts) have formed in the new pavement.  This project is established to obtain a third party to ascertain why these failures have occurred and to project the anticipated future life of Arnold Blvd. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   The work covered by the project consists of the contractor furnishing all layout, survey, plant, labor, supervision, quality control, materials, equipment, machines, tools, appliances, services, supplies, and incidentals and of performing all operations in connection with performance of the project, “GEOTECHNICAL TESTING  -  ARNOLD BLVD” at Dyess AFB, Texas, in strict accordance with this Scope of Work.

Review the applicable construction management project folders (contractor submittals, mix designs, test reports, etc) available @ 7th Civil Engineer Squadron, 710 Third St, Dyess AFB.  Project folders will be made available to the successful contractor. Perform in situ geotechnical testing of the completed work on the south half  of Arnold Blvd. Prepare a report and submit to Contracting Officer for approval that summarizes all the above work efforts with test results, data, procedures, conclusions and recommendations.  Specifically present recommended repairs for the existing potholes and ruts.   Also, provide evaluations regarding the anticipated future behavior of the non-failed areas. REQUIRED TESTING: Contractor shall provide hand-held soil penetrometer geotechnical testing of the subgrade at 20 locations along Arnold Blvd.  Provide test results from the top of subgrade (bottom of base) to a point at least 3-feet below top of subgrade, or refusal.  Contractor shall correlate these test results to California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values and density.  At each of these 20 locations, contractor shall perform two probes - one in a contractor provided core-drilled hole in the paved driving lane and one in the unpaved shoulder.  Following testing, contractor shall fill each core-drilled hole with tamped soil materials, topping off with at least 2” of tamped cold mix asphalt – level with the existing asphalt pavement.  Contractor shall also wash/clean-up pavement from all trace of core-drilling/testing. Additionally, Contractor shall perform the following testing: Two CBR tests in the unpaved shoulder for verification/calibration of the hand-held penetrometer results. Proctor results (optimum moisture/maximum modified proctor) and plasticity index for five locations to assist in understanding penetrometer results. Five undisturbed samples (Shelby tubes) in selected core-drilled holes- providing test results for in situ density, moisture and plasticity index conditions – to assist in understanding penetrometer results. Other non-destructive tests - deemed appropriate by Contractor.  If other test are proposed, provide a listing of such test(s) with explanation and associated costs with proposal. PERFORMANCE TIMES:  With Dyess AFB’s main feeder artery (Arnold Blvd) currently being restricted to use of only the north half with two way traffic,  all testing of the driving lanes of the south half of Arnold Blvd shall be performed during off peak times, i.e. Saturdays or Sundays – when scheduled by Contractor and approved by Contracting Officer.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

(i) Relative Capability to meet the Government requirement.

The Government will evaluate each offeror's relative capability on the basis of the offeror’s technical plan and breadth, depth, and relevance of experience to the work that will be required under the prospective contract. The Government will use the offeror’s technical plan and submitted resume to evaluate capability.  The Government will assess relative capability on the basis of the following:  
1.  Demonstrated knowledge and experience using the Department of Defense Modern Personnel System (Oracle Based).
2.  Demonstrated knowledge and experience with Department of Navy Staffing and Recruitment processes and procedures.

However, in making the Government’s best value decision, the importance of price as a factor will increase with the degree of equality in the non-price factor of offeror’s solicitation responses.
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Jun 2003) Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Nov 1995) with their offer.

Technology Enhancement. It is anticipated that the Government’s requirement for the equipment describe in this contract will extend over several years, perhaps exceeding the technological life of the proposed equipment.  It may be in the best interest of the FBI, as well as the contractor, to substitute equipment of a newer technology for the equipment proposed, or some portion thereof, provided that the conditions below are satisfied.  During the life of the contract, and under its terms and conditions, the Government may request, or the Contractor may propose to provide, technologically advanced equipment, software or any other item(s) contracted hereunder.  Types of Upgrades.  The upgrades covered by this clause will generally be substituted for functional items/systems already in the contract. The substitution may be in total or in part.  The upgrades discussed in this clause are not replacements for items or systems already ordered and installed, and nothing in this clause shall be construed as authority for such replacement of installed equipment.  The one exception to this exclusion is software.  Installed software will always be eligible for an "upgrade", to allow the Government to maintain currency, consistency, and compatibility in its software.  It is further understood by the parties to this contract that this clause envisages technological refreshment related to the general type of hardware and software covered by the scope of this contract.   Minimum Qualifications for Acceptance of Upgrades.  The Government is under no obligation to substitute any item for an item already listed in the contract.  However, subject to mutual agreement when required above, when items are added to this contract under this clause, the item(s) shall meet the following criteria: (1)  have been sold to the general public in substantial quantities before substitution under this clause; (2)  meet or exceed all mandatory requirements of the contract; (3)  be fully compatible with the originally proposed equipment; (4)  the price should be equal to or less than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the item.  The Contractor shall agree to all terms and conditions, including delivery and installation, being equal to or more favorable to the Government than the substituted equipment; (5)  be judged technically acceptable by the COTR; (6)  be approved in writing, by execution of a contract modification, signed by both the FBI Contracting Officer and the Contractor's representative; and (7)  shall undergo acceptance testing in accordance with the terms of the contract.   Pricing of Upgrades.  The pricing of upgraded item(s) shall be negotiated on a case by case basis provided that the final price shall not exceed the limitations specified above.   Delivery of Upgrades.  Notwithstanding the delivery requirements set forth in section C, initial delivery requirements for upgraded items shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this contract at the time the upgrade item is added.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to set the delivery schedule based on the longer of the standard commercial delivery schedule of the item(s) or the contract's standard delivery schedule for similar item(s), if a mutually agreed schedule cannot be met.  After the first 60 days, the original contract schedule for delivery takes effect if it is less than the initial agreed upon delivery time.   Identification of Technologically Advanced Products.  While the Government reserves the right to independently solicit a proposal from the Contractor under the terms of this clause at any time, potential upgrades will normally be brought to the attention of the Government by the Contractor. The government may place orders using the government credit card or by purchase order.  The Government reserves its rights under the Inspection of Services and Termination Clauses.  Offerors are to provide their commercial warranty and delivery information with their proposals.  Offerors are required to submit product samples (as a kit) and all product literature and technical information, including specification data sheets and quality assurance inspection documentation, in order for the government to sufficiently evaluate whether the product meets the governments’s need.  Offerors shall also provide any awards and /or certifications, including ISO 9001 certifications, to be used for evaluation purposes.  Offerors are to provide the last three current and/or past contract references to include: Name, address, current phone number and facsimile number, and contract number.  This information will be used to evaluate offeror’s past performance history.  Addendum to 52.212-1 Modify (c) Period of Acceptance of Offers.  The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.  Delete (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.  Addendum to 52.212-2 Tailored to read as follows: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical (technical design, capability of the item offered to meet the government’s need, compatibility with the FBI’s current inventory which consists of ITT Night Vision model NE6010F and Litton Systems NVP units, Models M944 and M944A, warranty and delivery terms); Past Performance; and Price (by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, using a quantity of one.  Evaluation of options does not obligate the government to exercise the option(s)).  Past performance consists of: quality of product; certifications and/or awards from other businesses/agencies including ISO certification; customer satisfaction; and adherence to delivery schedule.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation being requested and written solicitations will not be issued.  The solicitation number is FA3030-04-T-0022, issued as a request for quotation.  Responses/offers are due by 28 April 2004.  Please visit www.eps.gov and register to automatically receive procurement notification from EPS.  The system will inform you, via email, when there has been activity on EPS concerning this solicitation.  Solicitation provisions are those in effect for Federal Acquisition Circular 97-15 and DCN 20000210.  The acquisition is set aside for small businesses only with a NAICS Code: 238990 and Size Standard: $11.5.M. 
     CLIN 0001.  Restoration and Transportation of C-47 Aircraft (S/N 0-28866) from Pate Museum of Transportation, Cressen, TX  to Goodfellow AFB, San Angelo, TX 76908.  Work is to be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work. 

Statement of Work 
C-47 (S/N 0-28866)

Transportation of C-47 aircraft from the Pate Museum of Transportation, Cressen, TX, where the aircraft currently is on outdoor static display, to Goodfellow AFB, San Angelo, TX, where it will be erected upon government-provided ground mounts and placed on permanent outdoor static display. Prior to its display at Goodfellow AFB, the C-47 will be restored as an EC-47. 

 
(1)	Transportation of C-47

The Pate Museum of Transportation in Cressen, Texas, lies immediately southwest of Fort Worth, about 200 miles east of Goodfellow AFB. The transportation of the aircraft from the Pate Museum will include: the disassembly of the aircraft at its current site to the extent necessary to effect its transportation by truck; the carriage of the aircraft ultimately to Goodfellow, either before or following accomplishment of the restoration work as described in section 2, below; and the reassembly of the aircraft in preparation for permanent display as described in section 3, below.  Upon arriving at Goodfellow AFB, alternative ingress to the installation’s main gates on Kearney Boulevard can and will be arranged if necessary.  Technical data and information on DC-3/C-47 aircraft that may prove useful in developing cradles, slings or special tooling requirements may be found at the following web site:  http://www.centercomp.com/cgi-bin/dc3/gallery?25000.  The contractor will be responsible for providing all cranes and special equipment needs for the project.  Approximate aircraft dimensions are:  length-64.2 ft.; height-16.92 ft.; weight- 16,974 pounds.  All fluids have previously been drained from the aircraft, and the aircraft will never again be made airworthy. The aircraft is currently not inside a building, and will not be an indoor static display after restoration.
(2) Restoration
The restoration will include: the replacement of the right-front windows with unpainted standard safety glass similar in appearance to the other windows currently on the aircraft, so that all aircraft windows have a similar appearance; the replacement of any additional windows damaged in transport or while awaiting transportation from Cressen, Texas; the replacement of the fabric control surfaces with metal; all other cleaning and body-preparation work to the outside of the aircraft necessary for presenting a professional, well-maintained appearance. The contractor will be responsible for sealing the airplane to keep out birds and rainwater. The contractor will also seal all doors, hatches and panels to prevent human ingress and egress, leaving one door able to be opened when unlocked with a key. There will be no restoration to the interior of the aircraft; restoration of the inside of the aircraft is not a part of this contract.

The display we wish to present is an EC-47Q, tail number 43-15204, of the 361st Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron operating out of Ubon Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand. This was the last EC-47 to fly a combat mission in Southeast Asia, on 15 May 74. A painting of the aircraft can be seen at the following web site: http://www.ec47.com/artoffer.htm, and the 17th Training Wing History Office will provide precise data on aircraft color, markings and insignia. Additionally, the restoration of this aircraft will include the modification of the size and shape of the nose to represent a radome plus the attachment of upwards of one dozen antennas consistent with the EC-47 Sanders Systems ALR-38 employed by EC-47Q “204.” Affixing these antennas and modifying the size and shape of the nose will be the responsibility of the contractor. However, the antennas and nose need not be original parts but may be mock-ups crafted strictly for display purposes. Again, the 17th Training Wing History Office will provide precise data on the location, size and shape of the antennas and nose.


(3) Erection

Following the restoration of the aircraft (or prior to it, at the discretion of the contractor), the contractor will place the aircraft upon ground mounts at the designated permanent display site in front of the new wing headquarters along Kearney Boulevard on Goodfellow AFB.  Note, there is a building construction project proceeding simultaneously with the restoration of the C-47, and on the land the C-47 will be mounted upon.  The government will tell the contractor when to mount the aircraft.  That time may or may not coincide with the time the contractor completes the C-47 restoration project.  There will be three ground mounts, one per wheel. At the same time, the contractor will affix such other tie-downs as are necessary to secure the aircraft in the windy environment normal for San Angelo, Texas. The government will furnish and pre-position the ground mounts and tie-downs; the ground mounts and tie downs ARE NOT the responsibility of the contractor for this project.  However, mounting the aircraft on the ground mounts IS the responsibility of the contractor.  Removal of all obstacles to mounting the aircraft is the responsibility of Goodfellow AFB.  The aircraft will have to transit across landscaped areas during the erection phase of the project.  Goodfellow AFB will be responsible for all re-landscaping, but the Contractor will be told which path to use and is expected to use all due prudence limiting the damage to landscaping.

The new wing headquarters, where the aircraft will be placed on permanent display, is currently under construction but will be completed in or soon after February 2005. A spacious work site adjacent to the permanent display site is available for use by the contractor in performing the restoration work to this aircraft. The project must be completed no later than 28 February 2005.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following information associated with the original notice:

Background

The U.S. Agency for International Development (hereinafter “USAID” or the “Agency”) has conducted a New Entry Professional (NEP) Program since the 1999.  This has been the primary method of bringing new Foreign Service (FS) officers into the Agency.  The NEP programs include a comprehensive orientation, overseas temporary duty assignments, brown bag lecture series, rotations or other career development activities and programs.  USAID has also just reintroduced an International Development Intern (IDI) program as another means for bringing into the Agency new Foreign Service officers in addition to the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) and NEP programs.  Almost since the inception of the NEP programs coaches have been used to better orient new employees to the Agency.  Among other duties the coach works as a conduit for communications among all those involved in the Programs: agency coordinators, supervisors, mentors, Assignment & Performance Counselors, advisors, and NEPs, IDIs and PMFs.  Within USAID, the Bureau for Management, Office of Human Resources, Personnel Operations Division, (M/HR/POD), acting as the Agency Program Coordinator, is responsible for coordinating the recruitment and appointment activities and coordinating career progression activities.  The NEP program has been a valuable tool for USAID to attract high quality professionals to the Foreign Service ranks.  It is anticipated that the IDI program will yield similar results. Because the trainees are such a valuable resource to USAID and represent the future of the Agency, M/HR/POD would like to continue its support for the program by offering the services of coaches to help the trainees with their professional, development in the Agency.  M/HR/POD feels that based on positive experience with coaches in the NEP program it is important to continue this coaching program to aid retention, to facilitate smooth entry into the Agency and to boost morale.

Statement of Work

The coaches will provide developmental guidance and expertise to New Entry Professionals (NEPs) International Development Interns (IDIs) and Presidential Management Fellows (PMFs) in the following manner:

The contractors (coaches) will attend coach/supervisor training sessions on roles and responsibilities; be updated on USAID's promotion precepts and the list of competencies that need to be mastered prior to being assigned overseas; and know how to assist supervisors in the development of Individual Development Plans (IDPs).   Prior to the start of each class the coach will be given individual assignments.  Periodically, the coach will also be exposed to USAID mentoring and coaching techniques.  The coach will not need to participate in the administrative part of the training, but will attend other sessions relevant to NEP/IDI/PMF concerns (specific sessions that are considered relevant will be decided in cooperation with M/HR/POD).  It is important to ensure that the coach is brought up-to-date on the current state of affairs in USAID, which should occur through a combination of the coach's initiative and information provided by M/HR/POD.

Coaches may be asked to lead and/or participate in training sessions as well as the training of new coaches.

By the end of the orientation session, each coach will have reviewed the promotion and tenure precepts with each new entrant so that s/he is familiar with the FS requirements.  Coaches will assist with assessing their individual skills and competencies through the development of an Individual Development Plan (IDP).  Coaches will assist in identifying skill and competency gaps so that these areas can be addressed during the training period.  Coaches will also provide assistance in helping them to understand the precepts and competencies and integrating them into their IDPs.

Throughout the remainder of the performance period, coaches will avail themselves to support and guide trainees in their career training development and will troubleshoot specific areas in a development plan that may need additional attention.  At least half of the time spent as a coach/mentor shall be performed on-site at USAID/Washington.  The remaining effort may be expended off-site by other means (e.g. communications via telephone, facsimile, email, etc,).  As directed by the Cognizant Technical Officer coaches shall work with supervisors and other assigned supervisory personnel throughout their rotational assignments to ensure that training plans are being implemented.

At the end of the contract the coaches shall prepare and submit to M/HR/POD a report for each trainee assigned to him/her for coaching, outlining the progress and development status basis of each entrant.  The reports may include any additional information or recommendations that the coach deems pertinent to the overall development and training program.  These reports will be considered privileged information and not for general distribution.  Given the special confidential (safe haven) nature of the trainee’s relationship with the coach, the coach will not be required to provide 360 input; on the trainees annual evaluation. The coach may also be requested by M/HR/POD to meet periodically to discuss progress and issues.

The coach will keep supervisors, the CTO and the Recruitment and outreach Coordinator, informed on problems and progress. E-mails, telephone and/or facsimile messages should be used to ensure that pertinent information is available as needed.

The coach should also be oriented to and be familiar with the overall trainees programs. The coach will work with HR in arranging meetings as necessary with relevant other USAID offices.

Contract Type

The contract will be a firm fixed priced contract.

Price Schedule

Line Item One 001 Estimated Quantity (EQ) 94 Days, Unit Price $______; Total $__________.

Period of Performance

The period of performance for this contract will be from June 1, 2004 through October 8, 2004.

Security Clearance

Contractors/Coaches should have or obtain a security clearance at the Secret Level that will enable them to visit their trainees within secure areas of the USAID facility in the Ronald Reagan Building.  Contractors would need a facility clearance.

Deliverables

The coaches shall provide a report by the fifth day at the end of the contract to the CTO.  The report should include: (1) observations regarding how the coaching function has worked for the trainee; (2) recommendations for improvements to the trainee coach support function and the parties responsible for taking action to make those improvements.  The report shall also provide recommendations for any additional sessions, training, or topics that should be added to the existing Orientation Program.  The contractor shall provide monthly invoices for approval to the CTO.

Evaluation Factors for Award

1.	Experience (60 points): Personnel shall have relevant work experience and knowledge of the Foreign Service personnel system (e.g., what is expected of a Foreign Services Officer).  Also should have work experience in working overseas and in Washington and experience interacting between Washington and with field offices (Missions) overseas.
 
2.	Past Performance (40 points): Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  In evaluating past performance, USAID may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources, bureaus, published media and electronic data bases.

3.	Cost will be based on best value. 

PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS: The technical proposal should contain the following information as a minimum:  Your method and technique for providing coaching services; A discussion of your skills as a coach in providing similar services; Past Performance References of similar projects in the last three years including the company/federal agency name, contract number; contact person, telephone number; and resume of personnel.  The Cost proposal should include all associated costs with Line Item #1 filled out; Contractor Employee Biographical data sheet which can be downloaded at http://www.usaid.gov/procurement_bus_opp/procurement/forms/1420-17/.
All proposals shall be submitted by May 11, 2004 at 10:00am.  Due to the September 11, 2001 incident, it is not recommended that proposals not be delivered by mail since additional days are added in the sanitizing of mail for delivery to Federal Buildings in this zip code.  It is recommended that mail be delivered by courier services such as FEDEX, US Post Office overnight mail or hand-delivered by the contractor to M/OP/REG/LMA, Office of Procurement, US Agency for International Development.  Proposals can be submitted via mail at 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Room 7.10-062, Washington, DC 20523.  POC: Raymond Jennings or email to rjennings@usaid.gov.  The proposed procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon merits of the offer and the offeror’s capability.  Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror’s past performance and experience to be more important than its price.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER:  PROC0400151 – AMENDMENT – NO. 3.
This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to include the following Questions and Answers regarding this synopsis/solicitation.  IN PARTICULAR, QUESTION NO. 7 SHOULD BE CAREFULLY REVIEWED FOR PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS.  Also, the Questions and Answers may be found at:  http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm.
The following questions and their answers have been submitted to the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) vis-à-vis combination synopsis/ solicitation PROC0400151. 
1.	What is the NAICS small business size for this requirement? The NAICS is 443120 for the requirement listed in synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151.  The small business size is 500 employees. 
2.	What do I need to provide should I decide to submit a proposal?
All the information you need may be found at the following web site:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm
3.	What items have you requested be available under any resulting BPA?
See Answer No. 2
4.	Is this a GSA BPA? No, as explained in the combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, this award is to be made by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
5.	Is Teaming allowed? Yes, teaming is allowed.  The USPTO encourages teaming with other small businesses.  
6.	Are desktop computers to be included as offered products?  No, as explained in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, the USPTO already has mandatory source contracts for these products.
7.	Offerors are required to submit examples of prices discounts, or volume discounts for similar types of IT products in conjunction with evaluation factor No. 5 (Price).  How many examples should we submit in our proposal?
In order to clarify this question, the USPTO has decided Offerors should submit examples of its 10 largest sales, which represent the types of IT products, that the company has sold to the federal government community in the last two years.  The examples should be a variety of products and should be listed in a spreadsheet with the heading of “Description”, “Quantity”, “Date of Sale”, “Regular Price”, “Price Discount Given to Government on Items”, “Final Price to Govt”.  If Offeror did not offer the Govt. a discount from its regular charged prices, please indicate by using “N/A”.  In addition, the Offeror shall submit sales copies (i.e., purchase orders, sales receipts, etc) of its 10 example orders to substantiate its sales.   
8.	Do you have a required format for catalogs and price sheets that would make product and price evaluations easier?
There is no required format for catalogs.  Submissions can be in the format that the offeror uses to provide information to its customers.
For price sheets, see answer to No. 7 above.
9.	Can I get a printed copy of the RFP?
No, as explained in combination synopsis/solicitation No. PROC0400151, the announcement of the requirement serves as a combination synopsis/solicitation and “…a written solicitation will not be issued…” 
10.	In Solicitation PROC0400151, you state, “The USPTO’s requirements for FY2003 were approximately $50 million.” Using this information is it correct to estimate the value of the entire contract (base years plus option years) to be approximately $250 million (50 X 5).  Is this a correct estimation, or is $50 million the sum of the contract?
As stated in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, “…The United States Patent and Trademark Office…intends to establish a manageable number of Blanket Purchase Agreements to fulfill…Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products. The USPTO’s requirements for FY2003 were approximately $50 million…”. Any award resulting from this combination solicitation/synopsis will be a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). FAR 13.303-1(a) defines a BPA as “…a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing “charge accounts” with qualified sources of supply…” The $50 million figure represents what was ordered in the past and shall not be construed as a guarantee of future orders in that amount. There is no guarantee of receiving a call just because a company has a BPA. Calls will be competed between/among all BPA holders. 
A BPA is nothing more than an agreement on how supplies may be purchased if the BPA holder offers the lowest price for supplies. This combination synopsis/ solicitation guarantees only that any firm holding a BPA will be given the opportunity to compete for requirements when they become available.
11.	 Is pricing required to be submitted for the items listed in the sample list of  USPTO’s previously purchased Information Technology (IT) products, located at:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpalst.pdf.
No.  The sample list of IT products is provided as information purposes only of the types of IT products the USPTO had purchased last year.  Offerors are not expected to price this list of products.  Offerors should provide pricing information in its proposal for similar types of IT products the company has recently sold to the federal government community. See Answer to No. 7 (above).
12.	May companies submit proposals that only offers IT products in one area, i.e., network servers?  As stated in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, “ The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle that offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software, and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services…”  Those companies offering products in only one area will not meet the USPTO’s requirements, and will be not considered for award. 
13.	 “You want us to submit a sample of items we sold previously to the Government along with PTO cost for these items. We cover a very wide range of computer products (hardware and software) and services.  How many items would you consider reasonable to list.  Is it advantageous to add as many items as possible?”  See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
14.	 “Could you clarify what you all are looking for as far as pricing information?  Do you all want pricing for all of the items in the spreadsheet of previously purchased items or are you just looking for a sampling?”
See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
15.	“Is there any recommended format for the price sheets”.  See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
16.	 “Should and do we have to submit pricing for each item on the list posted on the website?”
See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
17.	“How can I obtain a copy of the items requested for the Solicitation Number:  PROC0400151”.  The USPTO has provided a sample list of USPTO previously purchased information technology products at:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm
This list is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a guarantee of future orders.
18.	 “My question is may we bid on this solicitation, since we are a service firm and need the clearing houses for the hardware and software?”.  The requirements under this combined synopsis/solicitation requires the offeror to submit a capabilities statement, with 3 current customers with whose company has had an established proposal relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year, ability to meet required delivery schedules, other factors, and price sampling.  If your company does not meet the requirements, your company would be disqualified from receiving an award.  As the synopsis/solicitation states: “Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government”.

<SUBJECT>15--Aerial Surveillance Platform in support of the Coalition Provisional Authority - Iraq
<SOLNBR>W58RGZ04R0547
<RESPDATE>050304
<ARCHDATE>07022004
<CONTACT>Carole Hubbard, (256)876-3390
<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 for the purpose of providing industry questions and government responses.  The proposal due date has not been changed.  Proposals are due either by email or facsimile no later than 3 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).  For those questions/responses that resulted in a change to the requirement, you will need to make a pen and ink change to the original synopsis/solicitation.  Solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 will not b e reposted in its entirety.  Due to the immediate need for these aerial surveillance platforms, no further industry questions will be accepted after 28 April 2004, 4:00 p.m. CST.  Q1: Will there be an observer onboard to operate the sensors and who is resp onsible for training this person?  A1: All students will be trained as pilot and observer.  Training will be provided on the system to include the plane and sensor suite.  Q2: We would like to know if a proposal using the following type of aircraft would b e considered as an option for your requirements in Iraq (contractor specifications redacted).  A2: Any offeror can propose based on the specifications set forth in the synopsis/solicitation.  We will not comment on the technical acceptability of a particul ar aircraft except through the proposal evaluation process.  Q3: Will the Army accept aircraft that use Premium Grade commercial fuels, i.e. 91 Octane unleaded or leaded fuel?  If not, will it accept aircraft certified with 160 hp engines (that require the  higher 91 octane) to be fitted with 150 hp engines that allow the 80/87 octane?  A3: Yes, 91 octane is acceptable.  An offerors proposal can address a modified fixed-wing aircraft as long as it meets the specification set forth in the synopsis/solicitatio n.  Q4: What is the concept behind the 60-80 knot surveillance speed?  Can the aircraft qualify if it will fly better in the 70-80 knot range?  If the speed is contemplated for an observer to spot ground targets, can more accurate sensors compensate suffic iently to allow the plane to fly a little faster and higher to be out of small arms range?  A4: The specification requires aircraft capable of 60-80 knots.  Any variance of the requirement will be evaluated and could result in a technical evaluation of NO GO.  Q5: Can the 0.2 cubic meter storage requirement be met with external pods?  A5: Yes.  Q6: Is there a separate contract available for actually hiring the pilots and operating the planes?  A6:  No.  Q7: Will the aircraft be required to have an FAA regis tration number (N number)?  If so, we will have to work registration and then transfer to the government.  A7:  No.  Q8: RE:  Communications Suite:  Civil/Military VHF Voice 118-174 MHz.  Most standard US Nav-Com Radios that provide the voice VHF Civil/Mil itary communication (Garman 530/Garman 430, etc) stop at or near 136.975 MHz.  Military Radios AN/ARC 210 etc. also do not go up to 174 MHz on that band.  Can you identify a civil radio by manufacturer or brand name or a military radio by nomenclature that  meets the 118-174 MHz so that this requirement can be met?  A8: We will accept a radio with frequencies from 118-136.975 MHz.  Q9: Civil Voice UHF. (c) Civil UHF Voice 430-470 MHz.  An extensive search for this type of radio indicates that it is a hand he ld device with an integral speaker and mic that would potentially interfere with navigation devices if operated as a hand-held device with no external antenna.  Will the government identify any manufacturer that has this type of radio that has either a TSO  or STC for installation in an aircraft?  A9:  The aircraft may need to communicate with Civil Forces on the ground using the frequency range 430-470 MHz.  The offeror is requested to advise the government if a radio is available to meet this requirement.  Q10: What is the level of training to be assumed by the contractor on the part of the pilots to be trained in terms of types of aircraft flown and number of fl ying hours?  A10: Iraqi pilots are all former fixed wing MIG pilots with varying degrees of experience from basic qualified to test pilot.  Q11: What is the level English speaking ability on the part of the selected pilots? A11: The training manuals shall be English and Iraqi Arabic.  The pilots will be able to understand, read, write and speak English at about the 3rd or 4th grade level.  The Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT)-9 will provide an interpreter with the pilots wherever the trai ning is conducted.  The interpreter will not be a student.  Q12: Should the English capability of the pilots in the program or the flying ability of the pilots in the program not allow the student to perform to normal commercial pilot standards IAW Federal  Aviation Regulations in the training program, where in the solicitation is the governments provision for recycling the student or replacing the student in the program?  A12: The contract will be awarded to include training of 16 pilots with an option to t rain up to 16 additional pilots.  In the event a student fails the training program, the option would be exercised to train a single replacement pilot.  Q13: RE: Acceptance Test Flight.  Will the CPA perform this test before the aircraft is deployed from o ur home base and ferried overseas or will they perform this test at Basra?  A13: The CPA will provide an aviator to conduct the test at the manufacturers facility.   Q14: RE: Acceptance Test Flight.  The contractor shall provide full support to personnel c onducting the acceptance test, including facilities, equipment, petroleum-oils-lubricants (POL), flight line maintenance support personnel, and any other support required for aircraft acceptance.  If this activity is to be conducted in Iraq, what is the ad dress and phone number of the person who can authorize and provide this space as required at Basra airfield?  A14: Test and acceptance can be done at the manufacturerÃ¢Â€Â™s facility.  Q15: RE: Authority (CPA) acceptance check flight.  Will the CPA provide  a pilot to attend the training so as to be qualified to perform an acceptance flight check or will the contractor perform the flight with a flight qualified observer of some sort from the CPA in order to accomplish the flight check?  A15: The CPA will pro vide an aviator to conduct the acceptance check flight at the manufacturerÃ¢Â€Â™s facility.  Q16: RE: Background.  The candidate aircraft must be new at the time of purchase.  In view of the fact that it is proposed to ferry the aircraft from the US to Ira q and that this flight will take approximately 25-35 plus hours of flight in addition to ferry time from the factory to the installation of the sensor suite etc, what constitutes the word NEW for purposes of this solicitation?  A16: The aircraft should be new at acceptance and test.  A reasonable amount of hours for ferrying will be allowed for tested and accepted aircraft during the delivery phase.  Q17: When the aircraft is delivered to Basra or any other location in Iraq, who is going to own and operate these aircraft and how will title be transferred?  A17: A CPA representative who is authorized to receive on behalf of the CPA will sign for the aircraft.  Subsequently, the CPA will turn the aircraft over to the New Iraqi Air Force.  The Iraqi Air Force w ill operate the aircraft.  Q18: Since the government is procuring this system, are we correct in assuming that the contractor does not have to file the ITAR/EAR licenses/approvals?  A18:  This aircraft requires only a Generation I infrared sensor which wil l not require a DOS determination, specific license or approval.  Q19: Para 3.0.1 requires system and airframe availability rates.  Please describe the calculation that will be used to measure the MC rates of the system and the availability rate of the sys tem.  A19: The Mission Capable (MC) rate is based on Reporting Time (RT) hours in a reporting period, compared to the number of hours the aircraft is available for a mission.  For an MC rate calculation, divide the MC hours by RT hours and multiply by 100.  An aircraft is Fully Mission Capable (FMC) when the aircraft is capable of safe flight and can perform all the prescribed missions for which the aircraft equi pment required by the Operator Minimum Equipment List (MEL) is designed.  FMC rate is based on the number of hours of FMC divided by the RT in a monthly reporting period.  Q20: Para 3.0.1 requires light gray paint.  Can you provide a mil spec or something to identify the shade of gray that is acceptable to the government?  A20: The aircraft shall be painted with flat light gray paint.  Q21: Para 3.0.2 requires aircraft to operate on 80-87 octane fuel.  Will 91 octane fuel be acceptable?  A21: Yes.  See Ques tion 3.  Q22: Para 3.0.4 requires the coms suite to have the capability to accommodate secure voice communication in the future.  What secure equipment will the coms package have to interface with?  A22: The government will accept a radio with frequencies from 118-136.975 MHz.  Q23: Para 3.1.1 (5) requires additional aircraft and engine maintenance manuals.  Are the aircraft and engine manuals required to be in Arabic or English?  A23: The manuals shall be submitted in 3rd to 4th grade level English and Ira qi Arabic.  Q24: Para 3.2 and 3.3 requires training to be conducted at the contractors location.  Can this training be done in the US?  A24:  Yes, if the contractors training facility is in the US.  Q25: Para 3.3 requires pilot training for aircraft qualif ication only.  Just to confirm, the government will provide Iraqi personnel that have credentials to pilot aircraft and will just need refresher and specific airframe qualification?  A25: Iraqi pilots are all former fixed wing MIG pilots with varying degre es of experience from basic qualified to test pilots.  Q26: Will the maintenance personnel the government provides have aviation maintenance credential?  A26: Previous qualifications are not FAA A&P licensed mechanics.  You can assume these are Iraqi milit ary trained mechanics.  Q27: Will the government require insurance coverages for the aircraft while being operated by the contractor for the purposes of training?  A27: The government does not require specific insurance coverage for your company-owned airc raft that will be used to train pilots and maintenance technicians.  Those aircraft are contractor property.  Q28: With regards to the subject solicitation, would the Army be interested in the use of UAVs for this mission on the basis that the contractor w ould supply the UAV systems (including ground equipment) and UAV system operators.  The contract could be on a basis of flight hours provided.  A28: No.  The system must be a manned fixed wing aircraft.  Q29: Clarify the size standard for NAICS 336411.  A2 9: The size standard of 1500 employees is the maximum number of employees for the business to be considered a small business.  Q30:  RE: Section 3, Mission Profile, Endurance with full payload.  Are the communications and surveillance systems to be Governm ent Furnished Equipment (GFE), Government Specified Equipment (GSE), or can we choose whatever we wish from any source as long as it meets the frequency range and/or performance criteria?  A30: The communications and surveillance systems will not be GFE or  GSE.  Offerors may choose which system to propose.  Q31:  If we are going to field a surveillance aircraft to be used in a hostile environment, with long mission durations, our troops deserve a more capable airframe than the current specifications indicat e.  Define the mission.  A31:  The mission is identified in the original synopsis/solicitation, paragraph 1.0.  Q32: Several sections of the solicitation refer to operations in IMC conditions.  Is an IFR certified aircraft considered a GO/NO GO item?  That  is, will the government accept a non IFR certified aircraft if the government deems that system to be a best value to the government?  A32:  The aircraft must be capable of IMC flight under IFR.  Your attention is directed to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, as stated in the synopsis/solicitation.  The technical acceptability of the aircraft will be rated on a GO /NO GO basis.  There will be NO BEST VALUE evaluation conducted on the proposed aircraft.  The point of contact for this action is Carole Hubbard, Contracting Officer, fax number (256) 955-8364 or email to carole.hubbard@redstone.army.mil.
