<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to negotiate with the Arkansas Childrens Hospital (ACH) a three year, sole source contract to conduct a follow-up study of the surviving cohort of preterm infants previously enrolled in grant study number 1-R01-HD36484, title Neurologic Outcomes & Preemptive Analgesia in Neonates (NEOPAIN). The Government is interested in obtaining status and information about the role of pain and its long-term effects on the overall health, well being, cognition, academic skill, executive functions, self regulation, attention and school status of the children now reaching ages 7-9. As a result, the NICHD does not have legal rights to the identifying data on the original cohort of participants. Therefore, the cohort could not be transferred to any other contractor by the NICHD. In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable assessment from infancy. With the exception of the incumbent, ACH, there is no domestic source presently known to the NICHD that has access to such a cohort and ownership of the specific patient population (required for this study) via data from the original NEOPAIN grant. It will cost the Government additional time and effort to duplicate the initial NEOPAIN grant study. All of the factors taken together make the ACH uniquely qualified for carrying out this study. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study which provides for longer follow-up and data analysis. 

This is not a request for proposals. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit three (3) copies of their statement of capabilities to the address provided within 45 days of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must document access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable assessment since infancy. All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.
NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES. 

Capability Statements should be sent to:

<CONTACT>Stacy Figlinski 850-235-5842 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a contract to Thales Australia Limited, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Division, Thales Australia Level 2 Building 51, Garden Island, Australia 2011, on a sole-source basis for the acquisition of two (2) Australian Acoustic Generators (AAG), two (2) Infrasonic Australian Acoustic Generators (IAAG ), and four (4) Sweep Tracker Monitor Systems (STMS4).  This contract also includes options for three (3) AAGs, three (3) IAAGs, and four (4) STMS4s in fiscal year 2010, and three (3) AAGs, three (3) IAAGs , and five (5) STMS4s in fiscal year 2011.  The AAG is a water driven turbine powered acoustic generator that produces ship emulation and can be integrated with any sweep system.  The IAAG is the low frequency variant of the Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG).  The STMS4 is designed for deployment with the AAG and IAAG to provide positional tracking data and to facilitate control of both manned an! d unmanned operations.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  All three items being procured are exclusively manufactured by Thales Australia Limited.  The STMS4 was manufactured exclusively to interface with the AAG and IAAG.   There are no distributors.  The AAG and IAAG as well as the STMS4 are proprietary to ADI Limited.  NSWC PCD has successfully evaluated this equipment for use in the US Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Fleet having acquired the equipment under contract N61331-06-C-0030 and N61331-07-D-0006.  Use of alternate equipment will invalidate these tests.  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to this equipment would require extensive development funds that Thales Australia Limited has already expended and will not be cost effective for the US Navy.  Additionally, numerous patent issues could require resolution.  In summary, the AAG, the IAAG, and the STMS4 are only available from Thales Australia Limited.  Delivery will be t! o the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407.   NAICS CODE is 334419.  Small Business Size Standard is $500 employees.  FSC is 5845.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611699   The US EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to LawProse, Inc. of Dallas, TX for a seminar on AdvancedLegal Writing & Editing from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm on March 12, 2009.  The justification is as follows.  The presenter for Law Prose Inc., Bryan A. Garner, is uniquely qualified to provide legal writing and editing services because of his technical and policy familiarly with federal writing requirements and processes.  He is also uniquely qualified to satisfy the professional needs of the EPA law enforcement legal community.  Garner is a nationally recognized lawyer, legal scholar and advocate for clarity and precision in legal writing. He is editor of Black's Law Dictionary, the standard tool of the legal trade and the co-author of "Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges" which Mr. Garner recently wrote with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  Because of Mr. Garner's inimitable background, style and presentation skills, he is unmatched in the American legal writing and editing universe.  Instruction from Mr. Garner would be both the centerpiece of the conference and would serve as an additional incentive for attorneys to attend and for managers to invest in sending personnel to this training.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center-Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, intends to issue a sole source modification to Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-W204/P00017 for spares with Time and Materials line items for services with General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), to extend the contracts ordering period from 31 December 2008 to 31 January 2009 to enable additional Delivery/Task Orders (DOs/TOs) to be issued for depot level and field support services only on a time and materials basis for the Common Ground Station (CGS) and Joint Services Workstation (JSWS).  There will be no increase to the contractual ceiling value and this effort is valued at $550K.  The CGS is a tactical data processing and evaluation center that links multiple air and ground sensors, to include the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft, to the Army Battle Command System at Echelons Above Corps, Corps, Division, and Brigade nodes. The CGS integrates imagery, video, and signal intelligence data into a single visual presentation of the battlefield, providing commanders with near real-time situational awareness, enhanced battle management and targeting capabilities. The JSWS provides similar capabilities, but it is not self-contained as is the CGS and it has limited communications capabilities (it primarily consists of CGS automated data processing equipment in transit cases).  The Government does not posses complete, detailed, and current technical data for CGS and JSWSs that would be essential for any other source to be able to produce form, fit, and functionally interchangeable spare parts to ensure the effective operation of the CGS and to provide the required support services.  This sole source modification is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1).  No formal Solicitation will be issued for this modification.

Background.  For the last several years, the Department of Defense (DoD) has been engaged in a broad effort to transform its business operations to support 21st Century national security requirements.  In support of that effort, the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) was established as a DoD Agency whose mission is to guide the transformation of business operations throughout DoD and deliver enter-prise-level capabilities that align to war-fighter needs and support national security requirements.  Informa-tion on the BTA may be found at http://www.defenselink.mil/bta/.   Additionally, an Enterprise-level frame-work was established that includes six Business Enterprise Priorities (BEP) targeted to improve business capabilities across the range of personnel, logistics, real property, acquisition, purchasing and financial capabilities.  Information on the BEPs and enterprise programs can be found in the 2007 Enterprise Tran-sition Plan (ETP) located at  http://www.defenselink.mil/dbt/products/2007_BEA_ETP/etp/ETP.html.  <BR><BR>To accomplish its mission, the BTA is concentrating its focus on a few critical lynchpins or focus areas.  One key focus area for the BTA is an effort to Rationalize the Enterprise.  The BTA is working to trans-form DoDs strategy of where and how each business capability is enabled by business systems.  In gen-eral, this strategy recommends that transactional systems generally be managed at the Component level and leverage DoDs investments in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, thereby enabling integrated end-to-end processes along each line-of-business based on standards defined at the Enter-prise level.   <BR>Another focus area for the BTA is Supporting the Accelerated Deployment of Component ERPs.  ERP technology represents the cornerstone of DoD efforts to streamline business process execution and in-crease Enterprise-level visibility for business information management.  As part of this focus area, the BTA has worked with Component ERP programs to resolve issues, provide stakeholder education, and help each align these ERPs with the BEA and related standards such as Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS). <BR><BR>2.  Objectives:  This Statement of Objectives (SOO) is intended to provide support to the BTA and the En-terprise Integration (EI) Directorate.  The EI Directorate acts as transformation champion for Enterprise Business Systems and Component ERP programs.  The Directorate establishes business partnerships across the DoD community to facilitate successful delivery of enterprise-level capabilities for ERP applica-tions and enterprise business intelligence and services.  The EI Directorate seeks to leverage best prac-tices across DoD enterprise resource planning initiatives and work toward rapid adoption of DoD-wide in-formation process standards.  Specific objectives include: <BR>"	Provide ERP implementation expertise that is leveraged by a majority of ERP programs in the Department;<BR>"	Provide advisory services for enterprise business systems that are critical to the success of the Departments ERP programs;<BR>"	Address BEP integration challenges by evaluating priorities and the alignment of systems and ini-tiatives targeted to improve ERP capabilities; <BR>"	Facilitate efforts to share ERP best practices throughout the enterprise;<BR>"	Develop a new model for ERP testing that addresses the challenges of both the DoD 5000 and the more recently deployed Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL) policy.<BR><BR>3.

A.	 General Information

NOTE:   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND STANDARDIZATION ACTION IS A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT FOR SOLICITATION NUMBER TMAR2-SS61 AND ALL PREVIOUS STANDARDIZATION ACTIONS  FOR SURGEONS GLOVES WITHIN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION.  ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST SUBMIT FOR THE FIRST TIME OR RE-SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSES REFERENCING THE NEW SOLICITATION REFERENCE NUMBER ASSIGNED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgeons Gloves, to include, but not limited to Gloves Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; Gloves Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free Beaded Cuff, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; Gloves Surgical Sterile Latex Powder Free, sizes 6.5 to 8.5; and Gloves Surgical Sterile Latex Powder Free Beaded Cuff, sizes 6.5 to 8.5.  

The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the TRBO via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Vendors must provide a response to each criteria listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Surgical Glove products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.   At a minimum, a complete product line includes:
- Glove Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free, sizes 6.5 to 8.5
- Glove Surgical Sterile Synthetic Powder Free Beaded Cuff, sizes 6.5 to 8.5

2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Surgeons Gloves product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors will be asked to provide an initial quote on discounts, in response to the FBO RFQ.  Vendors determined to be clinically acceptable, after clinical evaluation, may have an opportunity to submit a final quote at that time.
5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Surgeon Glove products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.  The size and type of Surgeons Glove is easily identified from the packaging
	a. The clinician must be able to easily identify the size and type of glove to facilitate 
                 efficient clinical process and to avoid unnecessary waste of product
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by visual inspection of the packaging
2. Surgeons glove sterility is reliably maintained during delivery of glove to a sterile field from the packaging
	a. The maintenance of glove sterility is an essential element in minimizing the risk of 
                 infection to the patient
	b. The clinician will evaluate this criterion by opening the package and delivering 
                the glove to a sterile field utilizing accepted standard clinical practices.
3. The Surgeons Gloves are easily donned utilizing the single, double, open, and closed gloving techniques
	a. The ability of the clinician to easily put on the gloves via the single, double,  
                open, and closed gloving techniques is vital to the clinician preparation for the
                procedure.
	b. Evaluation of this criterion will be accomplished via the clinician putting on the 
                gloves utilizing the single, double, open, and closed gloving procedures
 4. The Surgeons Glove cuff length is sufficient to fit over, and maintain position on, the surgical gown sleeve
	a. A good fit, and position maintenance, of the glove cuff over the surgical gown 
                sleeve is required to maintain the integrity of the of the clinician to patient barrier
	b. Evaluation will be accomplished by the clinician putting on the glove, covering 
                the gown sleeve with the cuff of the glove, and performing (or simulating expected 
                arm/hand movements) of a surgical procedure
5. The Surgeons Glove provides reliable clinician to patient barrier maintenance 
	a. Reliable maintenance of the clinician to patient barrier is a critical element in 
                minimizing risk of infection to the patient and reducing the risk of exposure to 
                blood and other body fluids to the clinician 
	b. The reliability of the clinician to patient barrier will be assessed via the clinician 
                use of the glove in the performance of a surgical procedure (or the simulation 
                thereof)
 6. The Surgeons Glove provides the required level of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity.
	a. The characteristics of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity (the 
                sense of touch) are extremely important in the clinicians ability to handle 
                surgical instruments, perform intricate movements, identify anatomical locations,
                etc. during a surgical procedure.
	b. The characteristics of comfort, flexibility/dexterity, and tactile sensitivity will be
                evaluated by the clinician using the glove during surgical procedure (or
                simulation thereof)

Scope:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations (USDOT/NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) conducts research and evaluation projects dealing with behaviors and attitudes in highway safety. Program focus is on drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. 
The OBSR intends to award a contract to assess the effectiveness of a sobriety checkpoint start time earlier in the day than what has traditionally been used, with accompanying signage, in raising public awareness of sobriety checkpoint activity and raising the publics perceived risk of an alcohol-impaired driver being stopped and arrested.  The basic research design will be for two intervention sites to implement the sobriety checkpoint program at two different times of the year separated by a minimum of six months, with the checkpoints augmented by variable message boards at other locations within the site communities.  There also will be one comparison site that will not be implementing the program.  In addition to obtaining sites and working with law enforcement agencies to implement the checkpoint program, the Contractor will conduct telephone surveys prior to, and immediately following, the intervention periods.  This will include interviews with individuals who have a cell phone but do not have a landline phone.  Projected Tasks are: 

1)  Prepare final refined work plan;
2) Recruit sites;
3) Prepare for baseline telephone survey;
4) Prepare for on-site intervention activity;
5) Conduct telephone surveys;
6) Implement sobriety checkpoint intervention activity; 
7) Brief NHTSA on results; and
8)  Submit final report.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;Background: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. To have the greatest impact on preventing disease and improving human health, the NIEHS focuses on basic science, disease-oriented research, global environmental health, and multidisciplinary training for researchers.</p>
<p>LOCATION: NIEHS is located on 375 rolling acres of rhododendron, oak and pine in Research Triangle Park (RTP). RTP, a science and technology hub was created by the state of North Carolina between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. NIEHS' main administrative offices and laboratories are on a large lake.</p>

The contractor should only be interested in developing prototype models for testing with ARDEC and not in any future production of this item. The contractor needs to have extensive proven expertise in prototyping and teaching of Unmanned launchable systems. ARDEC will have all rights to the products developed and tested and intellectual property.  We are looking for experience in the instruction of how to research, design, prototype and test: unmanned air systems, gun launch capability, flight modeling and prediction, low cost guidance system, payload prediction, initial projectile design, conversion to hybrid state and control to target, micro motors, on-board cameras, real time visual, hardened signals and circle and return features. The expected end result is to have Hybrid projectiles from 40-120mm prototyped and tested to prove out the technology and for ARDEC personnel to gain expertise in all aforementioned areas.  Expertise in advanced materials, power systems, motors that can be used for the hybrids or other projectiles developed by ARDEC is also needed.   We are looking for a comprehensive package of all the technologies and the ability to teach/train ARDEC personnel.  Please provide your socio-econmic status.

<DESC><p>The Spacelift Range Group (LRRG) Program Office will be holding an Industry Day on 23 December 2008 for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for the LRRG Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; widest industry participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712 (size standard 500). The Industry Day will be hosted by the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Bldg 272, Room C2-238, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback on the Government's draft acquisition documents for the LRRG SE&amp;I effort as part of the Government's ongoing market research. A draft RFP will be made available on or about 18 December 2008.</p>
<p>To aid in the development of a clear and effective RFP for the SE&amp;I contract, the LRRG Program Office is soliciting industry inputs on the following topics: 1) feedback on the Draft RFP, including the Performance Work Statement, Instructions to Offerors (Section L), incentive fee plan, contract deliverables and any other aspects of the documentation released; 2) Organizational Conflict of Interest issues; 3) feedback on the proposed 20% Tier 1 Small Business Subcontracting Goal; and 4) responses to the remainder of "Questions to Industry". A subset of the current program-developed copies of acquisition documents will be made available on the FEDBIZOPPS website under the title of LRRG SE&amp;I. Contractors shall document and submit all critical comments/input in writing, including recommended discussion questions and responses to the attached "Questions to Industry" by 1200 PST on 19 December 2008. Non-critical or general RFP document comments will be accepted through Industry Day. Discussion questions will be addressed through a formal Government-response posting on FEDBIZOPPS. All input shall be submitted to SMC/LRSW/PK (LRRG), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lin S. Jensen, Contracting Officer or via email to lin.jensen@losangeles.af.mil. Discussion questions must be marked appropriately; justification must be provided for any portion marked as proprietary or for other restrictions on their use.</p>
<p>All interested parties are invited to attend Industry Day on 23 December 2008, when the Government team will present an LRRG program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system requirements, and the SE&amp;I contractor's required interaction with the other program elements. In the afternoon, LRRG will meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties. Please contact the Contracting Officer to arrange your one-on-one appointment. Following Industry Day, the collective non-proprietary questions and responses will be consolidated and posted to the FEDBIZOPPS website.</p>
<p>Seating is limited and registration is required for attendance. Please contact the Contracting Office to register and for information on the facility being used for discussions. Potential prime contractors will be limited to four (4) representatives and one (1) representative per potential subcontractor. For one-on-one discussions, the individual prime contractors or prime contractor teams will be limited to ten (10) representatives. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>For access to Los Angeles Air Force Base and LRRG Industry Day, all Visit Requests should be faxed to the Visitor Control fax at (310) 653-9554 by 19 December 2008. Requests should specify "Attn: 1Lt Brett Hadley, LRRG SE&amp;I Industry Day" and contain the following: Name/SSAN/DOB/POB/Citizenship/Clearance Level/Clearance Investigation Date/Clearance Granting Agency/Member's Company-Organization/Meeting Subject/Meeting Location/ Visit Dates/LRSW Sponsor and Cage Code (for industry).

<p>Questions to Industry</p>
<p>1. Provide feedback on Section L/M.</p>
<p>2. Provide recommendations for Government insight into subcontractor execution and performance.</p>
<p>3. The concept for the potential contract is for the contractor to ensure the Government's functional, technical, and program baseline by producing and giving advice on Government referenced Architecture documents. Please identify the top three (3) risks associated with this concept.</p>
<p>4. Given the Incentive Plan and the requirements for the SE&amp;I contract, what would you recommend as an appropriate fee percentage for this contract? Can you suggest additional, alternative and/or better objective incentive events for this contract? Do you have any recommendations for better methods to incentivize performance using objective criteria?</p>
<p>5. What percentage of the entire requirement will be subcontracted? What percentage of the contracted work can be performed by small business (please provide a description of the work and the associated NAICS code)? What methodology was used to make the above determinations?</p>
<p>6. For the basic period of performance (POP) there are significant deliverables early in the POP. Please assess any risk in achieving the milestones.</p>

<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) intends to award a sole-source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the payload processing facility needed to support an April 30, 2009 launch of the SBSS Block 10 satellite. The specific tasks to be performed for this contract are outlined in the attached SOW and will be performed at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA.</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance is 15 January 2009 to 30 April 2009. Of specific importance is the availability of the facility to process the spacecraft from 1 March 2009 to 30 April 2009. Approximate value for services is estimated at less than $1.3M.</p>
<p>The intended source for this effort is Astrotech Space Operations Bldg 1036, Tangair Rd at Red Rd., Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA 93437, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />The Government believes Astrotech is the only company capable of providing the subject requirements based on the Government's need dates for spacecraft processing and services. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The attached Statement of Work (SoW) details the needs of the Government for spacecraft processing to include facility size, cleanliness requirements, mechanical and electrical interface requirements, and crane equipment which need to be in place for a spacecraft arrival of 1 March 2009.</p>
<p>Any persons or companies interested can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) containing the following information: Company name, address, primary POC including phone number, statement facility availability for processing, description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort, commercial pricing information, commercial terms and conditions, and insurance coverage. Interested parties must have experience with processing spacecraft with ISO Class 7 cleanliness requirements in the offered facility. The facility must also meet the other requirements listed in the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in electronic format MS Word 2000 or newer format, or PDF format and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font, with a maximum of 3 total pages (commercial pricing, terms/conditions, and insurance coverage does not count against the page limit), sent via email to: Roy Lee roy.lee@losangeles.af.mil and Major Roberto Acosta roberto.acosta@losangles.af.mil to be received NLT by 9:00 AM, PST, on 05 January 2009. Oral communications are not acceptable. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this announcement is 541330 with the applicable size standard of $25M. Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of a SOC. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting a SOC.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael D. Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email michael.blackstone@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Microsystems Technology Office (MTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to The University of Central Florida for continuation (Phase 2) of Architecture for Diode High Energy Laser Systems (ADHELS) Program. The ADHELS concept is to develop a laser-beam-combining approach for a high energy laser (HEL) system that is scalable to 150 kW and exhibits ultra-low size, weight and power. The University of Central Florida conducted a "Phase 1" ADHELS research effort under Grant No. HR0011-06-1-0010. The University of Central Florida's Phase 1 effort was competitively selected in response to DARPA BAA 05-09, "Architecture for Diode High Energy Laser Systems (ADHELS)".  Under this Phase 1 contract, The University of Central Florida began developing volume Bragg gratings (VBGs), made of photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass, for high power density, high spectral density, laser beam combining applications. The proposed ADHELS Phase 2 Program effort is a logical follow-on to the prior effort conducted by The University of Central Florida. Phase 2 will continue the development of PTR-based, high-power volume Bragg gratings for optically compact, high power density, high spectral density beam combining. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  As the developer of the current ADHELS concept, The University of Central Florida team possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and intellectual property required to carry out the required research effort.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew a sole source agreement to obtain bankruptcy record information with Pacer Service Center. Pacer is a service of the United States Judiciary, run by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and is available days, nights, and weekends. Pacer provides electronic access via the web for case and docket information from the Federal Appellate, District and Bankruptcy courts, and from the U.S. Party/Case Index. Almost 19 million cases are available, linked by most all courts in the U.S., and are updated daily. In addition to bankruptcy information, searches can be conducted to determine whether or not a person/party is involved in federal litigation. Pacer bankruptcy searches provide a listing of all parties and participants including judges, attorneys, and trustees; a compilation of case-related information such as cause of action, nature of suit and dollar demand; a chronology of case events entered in the case record; appellate court opinions; judgments or case status; and types of documents filed (ex. schedule of creditors). Pacer has been verified and approved within OPM for use in investigative products. Pacer is being considered because other commercial vendors only provide a portion of the bankruptcy file. Most vendors do not provide a copy of the Schedule, listing all creditors. Sending Special Agents to each individual court across the country to conduct record reviews is not practical or a good business practice. This service is also an integral part in supporting the goals of the National Intelligence Directive (NID) with regard to the Personnel Security Investigative mission. OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to Pacer Service Center. Pacer Service Center is the available responsible source and no other source will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 922110 - Courts. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a solicitation for offers, but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to Pacer Service Center. This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

<DESC>This announcement is being prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Part 5.203 and FAR 6.302-1(2).  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 813312 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
Overview:The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Region, intends to negotiate and potentially award a non-competitive fixed price cost-reimbursement type contract to the Interior Alaska Land Trust(IALT), of Fairbanks, Alaska.  The proposed contract being considered for negotiations shall include a base period not-to-exceed December 31, 2009.  This requirement is a follow-on project to previous years contracts that have aided in the establishment and continuation of the Chena Flats Green Belt Project near Fairbanks, Alaska.  As such, it is not anticpaited that open competition will result in a more viable source for continuation of the project.
Background:In May 2005, with help from the IALT, members of the Fairbanks community formed the Chena Flats Greenbelt Project.  The greenbelt project is located in Fairbanks, Alaska between the base of Chena Ridge and the Chena Pump Road.  A major goal of the Project is to conserve a portion of the remaining high-quality wetlands in the Fairbanks area to benefit wildlife and to protect surface and groundwater quality.  These lowlands encompass some of the last remaining natural lakes and wet-meadow wetlands in the immediate Fairbanks area.  The greenbelt also provides habitat for moose, lynx, owls, swans, cranes, and numerous other water birds.  The goal of the Chena Flats Greenbelt Project is to conserve approximately 600 acres of wildlife habitat and protect approximately 10 miles of multi-use trails. 
The IALT has been instrumental in the initiation of the Chena Flats Greenbelt Project over previous years as they have supplied technical advice, organization, and non-profit status for raising funds to protect this area of Alaska.  The proposed contract being considered will expand their conservation efforts on behalf of the Chena Flats Greenbelt Project as well as potentially other conservation projects within the Fairbanks Area.  The IALT will identify and target conservation needs in areas important to fish and wildlife resources that are also subjected to increasing development pressures.  The proposed contract will provide funds for IALT to schedule and hold public meetings, produce outreach materials, conduct mailings, and otherwise coordinate land conservation efforts within the Fairbanks area.
Purpose and Objectives:The proposed follow-on contract shall provide reimburable funding for education efforts aimed at residents in Fairbanks regarding the need for open space and wildlife habitat, and in turn create support for conservation efforts within the Fairbanks area, including Chena Flats.  The IALT will develop a strategic plan that recognizes and connects multiple trail systems, existing open space and proposed open space areas together into a coherent, realistic approach to the conservation of these areas of open space.  IALT will assist in negotiating the protection of key parcels within the Chena Flats Greenbelt as well as other projects as identified through the planning and outreach process of the proposed contract.
Specifically, IALT will:Establish an Outreach/Project Coordinator position to initiate educational and informational outreach to organizations and key individuals in the Fairbanks area.  This outreach will focus on the benefits of land conservation projects in the Fairbanks area.  
The Outreach/Project Coordinator shall:-Contact no fewer than twelve (12) organizations during the FY2008-2009 grant period, and will work to form partnerships with these groups to further land conservation efforts in Interior Alaska.-Organize no fewer than 4 community meetings, at least one dealing with the Chena Flats Greenbelt Project prior to November 1, 2009 to promote and discuss conservation projects and their value in the Fairbanks area.  -Brief reports on the outcome of these meetings shall be submitted to the Fairbanks Fish and Wildlife Field Office no later than 30 days after the meetings take place.  -Negotiate the protection of key parcels of land by meeting with interested landowners and discussing the conservation options and benefits available to them.  If beneficial to these negotiations, the coordinator may direct the use of these funds to land surveys and appraisals.  -An interim report of these activities shall be submitted to the Fairbanks Fish and Wildlife Field Office by June 1, 2009 and a final report of all activities undertaken during the contract period by December 31, 2009. -Recipient shall forward to the US Fish and Wildlife Service technical point of contact an interim report by June 1, 2009, and a final report summarizing all project accomplishments under the proposed contract by no later than December 31, 2009.  Brief summary reports shall follow each organized community meeting.
This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals as the government does not intend to evaluate or consider any proposal received in response to this announcement.  
It is anticipated that negotiations between the governement and the contractor for this requirement will occur approximately 10 days following the posting of this announcement on or about January 5, 2009, with a proposed award date of approximately February 1, 2009.

<DESC>N700090901  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), the National Park Service (NPS) intends to enter into negotiations with Vermont Center for Ecostudies (VCE) on a sole source, non-competitive basis for Forest and Grassland Bird Monitoring Protocol Implementation at eleven northeastern park sites (Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME, to Morristown National Historical Park in Morristown, NJ).  Vermont Center for Ecostudies developed the bird monitoring protocol being used by the NPS, and has also built up a network of volunteers who participate in this project.  VCE is knowledgeable in the specifics of this monitoring program, familiar with the parks and the specific bird monitoring routes being used, and VCE has been implementing this protocol for the NPS since 2006.  It would be in the best interest of the government to continue using the services of VCE for forest and grassland bird monitoring, because this will increase consistency in data collection and volunteer over-sight, and reduce annual costs due to the vendor's need to become familiar with the parks and the monitoring procedures.  Therefore, in accordance with the above cited authority, the government intends to enter into negotiations with Vermont Center for Ecostudies within 15 days after publication of this notice. The anticipated term of this contract is from February 1, 2009 through March 1, 2010 with four one-year options to extend the terms and conditions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   NAICS  813312.

<DESC>N1700090902  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), the National Park Service (NPS) intends to enter into negotiations with Carol Lynn Trocki on a sole source, non-competitive basis for Coastal Bird Monitoring Protocol Implementation at Boston Harbor Island National Recreation Area (BOHA).  Carol Trocki developed the bird monitoring protocol being used by the NPS, and has also built up a strong working relationship with BOHA staff and the network of volunteers who participate in this project.  Carol Trocki is knowledgeable in the specifics of this monitoring program, familiar with the park and the specific bird monitoring methods being used, and she has been implementing this protocol for the NPS since 2007 (and she conducted research on BOHA birds for several years prior to beginning this project).  It would be in the best interest of the government to continue using the services of Carol Trocki for coastal bird monitoring, because this will increase consistency in data collection and volunteer over-sight, and reduce annual costs due to the vendor's need to become familiar with the park, park staff, and the monitoring procedures.  Therefore, in accordance with the above cited authority, the government intends to enter into negotiations with Carol Lynn Trocki within 15 days after publication of this notice. The anticipated term of this contract is from February 1, 2009 through March 1, 2010 with four one-year options to extend the terms and conditions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   NAICS  813312.  For information or questions, please respond by email to Contracting Officer at linda_mcfarland@nps.gov or forward your questions by fax to 207-288-8709.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division, Orlando (hereinafter NAWC TSD) is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems suitable for effective training.    Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this notice, pending issuance of Class Justification and Approval 09-46C.  NAWC TSD intends on negotiating and awarding multiple spare and repair buys on a sole source basis from 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2009.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $11,500,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor, as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302, the proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and only negotiate with Attachment (A) sources.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (A) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.   Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than fifteen (15) days from the posting date.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to Attachment (A).  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one source, it will compete these acquisitions among the identified sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA is requesting information concerning availability of new or modified equipment and experience appropriate to manufacture small energetic devices at a high productionrate for a Navy R&D project.The device is essentially an environmentally friendly drop-in replacement for the current M52A3B1 electric primer used in 20mm aircraft gun ammunition. The expectation is to find automatic equipment that would conduct the loading processes for the manufacture of the replacement Lead Free Electric Primer (Green Primer). The operations would include inserting a small amount of powder or slurry (160 mg) into a small brass cup (.33" dia x .25"), consolidate the mix, add a cover disc and a support cup, and then press the final consolidation at 7500 psi to complete the assembly.  The energetic mix is static sensitive and is designed to be electrically initiated in the assembly.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR GREEN PRIMER LOADINGSeveral possibilities can be considered for handling the reactive mix formulation to be used in the electric primer. 	Handling of primer mix materials in green primer loading process.                    Dry Powder (160mg), static sensitive;
	         Wet powder mix (160mg), isopropanol solvent, minimum static(Requires drying after installation into the brass primer cup); 		Preformed pellets for machine insertion at primer assembly.
Current Load procedures use an initial insert and press of wet primer mix in the pre-assembled primer cup.  The item with the wet mix is then dried to drive off the solvent.  Using proper precautions it may be possible to automatically install and consolidate the dry powder primer mix. A cover disc and a support cup are then inserted into the primer cup over the dried primer mix.  Perhaps these could also be inserted by automatic machine.  Final press of the item in a die holder at 7500 psi completes the primer assembly.  The goal is to find out if automatic machinery could perform each of these steps.  Primer mix might be handled dry with a small dipper, wet with a syringe applicator, or pelleted prior to insertion.  Present day production of M52A3B1 Electric Primers for 20mm ammunition is a little over 100,000 pieces a day and procurement is in several million quantities.

I. BTRIS Project General Information

The Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) is developed to support all phases of translational research process at the NIH in order to facilitate the transformation of discoveries in basic, clinical, and population sciences into clinical applications.

BTRIS will be organized as a clinical research warehouse at the NIH Clinical Center (NIH CC) and is envisioned to function as the preferred information system to analyze the NIH clinical and preclinical data related to the development of new biomedical products and methods of diseases diagnosis, treatment, and control. 

BTRIS will integrate and standardize data from multiple and disparate NIH sources and data sets to provide NIH researchers with a powerful tool for: Aggregation data within a particular source and across data sources; protocol- and scientific subject-centric, as well as patient-centric data modeling and analysis; cross-protocol data integration and analysis; data reuse and sharing. 

BTRIS will accumulate and operate with current and historical data pertaining to a wide range of biomedical domains including but not limited to patient demographic data, vital sighs, laboratory test results, treatment and diagnostic procedures, pharmacy information and data on administered medications; patient medical history and visits, radiology services data with links to patient images in the radiology imaging system; pathology records; and multidisciplinary documentation in text format, as well as clinical study administrative and scientific protocol parameters.
All data accumulated in BTRIS information system will be maintained in coded form. In order to provide flexible class-based query, data mining, and analytical capabilities BTRIS will use for coding a common controlled terminology  called the Research Entities Dictionary (RED).



II. Minimum Requirements for HL7 Integration Engine

One of the requirements for the BTRIS solution is to capture and process data into the BTRIS Data Repository from the NIH Clinical Center (CC) and from other select Institute Centers (ICs).  BTRIS will receive some of this data in the form of HL7 messages; which are machine-process able, delimited ASCII text messages that describe individual clinical and administrative events.  Some examples of this are: the admission of a patient to the CC, the ordering of laboratory test, or the administration of medication.  The HL 7 Messaging Standards present a framework for structuring HL7 messages prior to sending them and for interpreting them upon receipt.  While people are able to read and interpret HL 7 messages, the expected volume of HL7 messages that BTIRS will receive (tens of thousands a day) necessitates an automated approach to HL7 message capture and processing. Its primary role is to coordinate and monitor messaging between the various data sources and stores associated with an organization's healthcare applications. For BTRIS, we need an HL7 Integration Engine that will: 

	Listening to the NIH network for incoming HL 7 message streams, more specifically for the envelopes that distinguish one message from another
	Acknowledging receipt of each message by generating and returning to the sender a new message that contains information from the received messages envelope.
	Removing the envelope from each received message, validating the message against the HL7 Messaging Standards, and either accept or reject the message, as appropriate.
	Parsing accepted messages to extract from them their data payloads, and transforming (if needed) and loading those data into the BTRIS data repository.
	Feed data directly to and from a database without the need for low-level programming
	Take one  systems HL7  output and transform it so that it will work as input to any other HL7 enabled system
	Ability to forward messages from a single source to multiple outbound targets selectively and intelligently
	Message routing to allow a user to specify a set criteria to govern message delivery
	Configuration work carried out with a graphical mapping tool to allow drag and drop message transformation and bi-directional HL7 database communication.
	Deployable across a wide range of technical environments with native cross-platform and multi-database support with ability to embed program extensions.



 
III. Term; Termination

The license granted shall commence on installation and registration of software.  This license shall be the most current version of the software.  In addition, one soft copy of all software documentation shall be provided as part of the license. A maintenance contract will also be purchased with the software license for one year duration.  This maintenance contract shall automatically renew for additional one year terms unless either party shall have notified the other in writing of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least ninety (90) days before the start of any renewal term. 

The Government shall receive a copy of the source code, without any charge, in the event that the Contractor ceases to do business without transfer of its obligations to a corporation which expressly assumes the obligations set forth in this contract or ceases to maintain the Licensed Software.  At any time, at the written request of the Government, the Contractor shall place the source code with a third party escrow agent to be determined when necessary and shall be responsible for the cost associated with this service

IV. Utilization

BTRIS Release 1.0 will consist of separate Development/Test and Production environments, each on a mixed physical and virtual platform based on commodity WINTEL hardware and VMware ESX. Each environment will include several application and system software packages, including a Database Management System (DBMS) and an HL7 Interface/Integration Engine (HIE). The DBMS will be Microsoft SQL Server 2003, which will run on dedicated physical machines in both the Development/Test and Production environments. The HIE will run on dedicated virtual machines (VMs) in both the Development/Test and Production environments. Three to five inbound HL7 message streams will feed both the Development/Test and Production HIE instances. The HIE instances will listen for, receive, acknowledge the sender for, and parse the inbound HL7 messages, and will write the message content to databases running on the SQL Server instances (i.e., the Production HIE instance will write data to the Production SQL Server instance, etc.)
 
For HIEs licensed by server, the Government will require two single-server licenses (i.e., one for the Development/Test VM and the other for the Production VM). For HIEs licensed by communications channel, the Government will require two five-channel licenses (i.e., one for the Development/Test VM and the other for the Production VM). The Government expects that Development/Test licenses carry lower purchase and maintenance prices than do Production licenses.
 
The HIE software may be used by any subdivision of the licensing agency (i.e., service, bureau, division, command, etc.) that has access to the site at which the software is placed, even if the subdivision did not participate in the acquisition of the software, so long as the Government complies with the provisions of the licenses. The Government shall have the right to use the computer software and documentation with the computer for which it is acquired at any facility to which that computer may be transferred, and to transfer the software and documentation to a different computer if the computer for which it is acquired is removed or destroyed. The Government shall also have the right to use the computer software and documentation with a back-up computer when the primary computer is inoperative, and to copy computer programs for safekeeping (archives) or back-up purposes.




V. Support/Maintenance
	
Software Documentation/Releases
The Offeror shall provide one full set of documentation electronically at purchase time that addresses all aspects of system implementation, ongoing system operation, and end user instructions for use. The Offeror shall provide revised documentation for all major releases or product upgrades.  This documentation will clearly describe the changes and their impact on system functionality.  The software provider, without additional charge to the government, shall respond to and correct problems in the software which result in the software substantially failing to operate in a manner consistent with its user/technical documentation and/or its specifications. The software provider will provide patches, software enhancements, or software defect corrections as needed along with one (1) copy of all published revisions to the electronic (if/when available) documentation and one (1) copy per license of, or authorization to copy, new releases of the software.

Support term to start upon installation and registration of software for a period of one year. Licensee may purchase additional 1 year Technical Support Service packages.  


VII. Acceptance
 

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any software that has been tendered for acceptance.  The Government may require replacement of nonconforming software at no increase in contract price.  The Government must exercise its post acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the software unless the change is due to the defect in the software.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the brand name Quest software products to manage the Active Directory (AD).   

Active Directory stores, organizes and providTes access to all the user, group, resource permissions, and also helps in the management of users, departments and their relation to IT resources.  The current AD tools by Microsoft do not provide features for safe backup and recovery of objects in AD, nor does provide a lot of auditing capabilities and change notifications in the event of a disaster.  Changes to the Active Directory objects can be very disruptive to the enterprise by causing wide spread outage to network users and IT systems at USPTO.  The AD management tools developed by Quest Software are bundled with features of Change/Auditor, AccessManager and RrestoreAdmin. Based on the features and ease of use of the limited installation and evaluation at our lab, we decided that Quest products best meet the USPTOs requirements. The followings are the requirements:
Part Name	                                                  Part Number	    Qty

<DESC>The Amelia Earhart Center Modernization plan called for the use of specific modular furniture provided by the General Services Administration (GSA) approved source, Herman Miller, which supports the entire district and is interchangeable with all offices. This action supports the multiple moves and fluctuation of personnel in support of the District's continuous changing mission and personnel manning requirements. Changing to other furniture would eliminate our ability to modify configurations with on hand furniture, increase overall cost, and impact our ability to quickly react to personnel changes and ISO mission growth. Herman Miller was already purchased for the 6th floor on 30 Sep 08. Herman Miller should be purchased for compatibility, interchangeability, warranty, fit, uniformity, and ease of administration. The first estimated order date 30 January 09.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br />(b) Submission of quotations.

Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) N/A<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) N/A<br />(2)<br />(i) Any quote, modification, revision, or withdrawal of a quote received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quote would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of quotes; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of quotes and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of quotes; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for quotation, it was the only quote received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful quote, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the quote, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotes cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of quotes by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes. Oral quotes in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile quotes, quotes may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile quotes. A quote may be withdrawn in person by a vendor or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of quotes, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the quote.<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Multiple awards. (To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) N/A<br />(ii) N/A<br />(iii) N/A<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) N/A<br />(End of Provision)<br />(6) 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.<br />(i) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />(ii) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(iii) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters.  Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association, National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from and produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices.  To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking a contract for the continued monthly distribution updates for charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems.  The Coast Guards goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4.

Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS, is seeking an architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, the following.Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square foor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.  A/E shall submit one (1) set of Mylar sepia "as-builts" (each drawing shall be stamped "AS-BUILT" in red ink), and shall submit computer generated material depicting as-built conditions in accordance with all applicable VA Engineering CADD requirements.  A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCAD 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.Please note that this is NOT a request for SF330's or proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only.

and Economic Approach to make JP-8 from Algae.&rdquo; The primary objective of the
&ldquo;Biofuels &ndash; Cellulosic and Algal Feedstocks&rdquo; program is to develop the
technical capability, commercial algae production experience, resources, and
commitment to demonstrate and ultimately commercialize the affordable
production of JP-8 surrogate fuel from algal feedstock.<span>&nbsp; </span>The program will use a system integration
approach and system trade studies to select the required technologies to lead
to JP-8 surrogate fuel production costing less than $3 a gallon at production
rates of 50 million gallons per year.<span>&nbsp; </span>The main goal of the program is the mass production of triglyceride oils
from algal feedstock at a total cost of $1 to $2 per gallon of oil. </span></p>
