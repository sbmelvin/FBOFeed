However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
The FAA has a current requirement for the maintenance and training support of Smiths Detection 5030si HI-SCAN X-Ray Inspection Systems machines at approximately 50 locations throughout the continental United States.  Vendors are requested to demonstrate experience and capabilities of providing maintenance and training for Smiths Detection Model Hi Scan 5030si machines.  Substitution with like items is not acceptable.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work, attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

A subsequent, follow on acquisition for both X-Ray Machine hardware along with maintenance and training to support such hardware is anticipated.  It is the FAAs intention that this subsequent, follow on acquisition will not be brand or product specific.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) 	 (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause? (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service.

(A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means? (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. <BR> <BR>(i) Payments. (1) Work performed. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall?

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?.?] <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <BR> <BR>(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract. (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment? (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor?s timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall?

(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>(6) (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. <BR> <BR>(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. <BR> <BR>(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposals. A publically available solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the NIMH, intends to negotiate a procurement with the Department of Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry Section at the University of Pennsylvania, 10 Gates Building Philadelphia, PA 19104-4283, entitled "Phenotypic Manifestations of Copy Number Variations (CNV) in 16p11.2, MYT1L, NRXN, 15q13.3 and 22q11.2," on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span><br />This initiative is part of The Child Psychiatry Branch (CPB) at the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The mission of the CPB is to conduct research on the diagnosis, treatment, and neurobiology of childhood psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>The Child Psychiatry Branch (CPB) at the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is interested in the Phenotypic Manifestations of Copy Number Variations (CNV) in 16p11.2, MYT1L, NRXN, 15q13.3 and 22q11.2 in a specific population of subjects identified by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Center for Applied Genomics (CAG).</p>
<p>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) currently has a study population of 100,000 subjects, ages 0-21, in the Philadelphia area for which all health care records are online and linked to DNA samples. The study group includes healthy and ill subjects. These subjects represent a wide spectrum of diseases and/or conditions (including healthy controls). The DNA from this subject pool is currently being screened for the presence of CNVs in these 5 loci. It is hypothesized that CNVs in these loci can have a broad impact on psychiatric, neurological, immunological, and/or other system-wide or organ-specific functions, leading to a wide range of medical pathologies that have not been fully characterized or previously attributed to mutations at these loci. Findings from this study group may provide proof-of-principle to support other related studies to explore the role of pathogenic CNVs in many other regions (~200 loci) across the full ~150K samples in the CAG repository.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania is considered uniquely qualified to perform this work. The University of Pennsylvania and CHOP are both affiliates of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. No sources other than University of Pennsylvania have the required access to the medical records and the subjects from the CHOP subject population. The University of Pennsylvania has been conducting a pediatric population study involving genetic measures and clinical phenotyping of subjects from the CHOP subject pool. However, more data capture and analysis is necessary. In addition, there are no other known existing pediatric populations and associated databases that can be used for this study. The size and geographic diversity of the pediatric database is extensive and unique, as is the ability to generate the research findings on abnormalities in the development of brain circuitry in CNV carriers. Since researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with CHOP, have been granted sole access to the unique subject population and database to be used in this study, they are considered the only group that can perform this Project.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) and FAR 6.302-1, University of Pennsylvania is the only source capable of meeting the requirements of this project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span><br />The NIMH intends to issue a new, non-competitive contract, to the University of Pennsylvania to conduct follow-up studies in a broad group of patients with CNVs identified by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). This Contract will collect additional data and analysis from subjects screened by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to further identify the range of phenotypic manifestations caused by pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) arising from deletion or duplication of the 16p11.2-16p12.2 region, 22q11.2 and deletions of part or all of the MYT1L,15q13.3 and NRXN genes.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</span><br />Independently, and not as an agent of the federal Government, the Contractor shall furnish, as needed to perform the work set forth herein, all necessary labor (qualified and experienced personnel), services, equipment, materials, supplies, and facilities, except as otherwise specified herein. The Contractor shall: (1) Identify/select ~150 appropriate subjects for this Study, as approved by the COR, by examining screening data provided by the University of Pennsylvania from a current CHOP pediatric population study involving genetic measures and clinical phenotyping; (2) Provide follow-up characterization of the selected subjects, involving, but not limited to, the following procedures: (a) Structured diagnostic psychiatric interviews utilizing the K-SADS for children and adolescents, and C_GAS for overall level of functioning; (b) Neurocognitive testing measuring: executive, general cognition, social cognition, and working memory; (c) Current medical status for all systems; (3) Evaluate the reliability and validity of these measures; (4) Report the findings on a quarterly basis, and the final data on 150 subjects in a Final Report; (5) Follow the NIH clinical practice regulations in performance of this contract: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/index.htm <br />http://clinicalresearch.nih.gov/ethics_guides.html.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REPORTS/DELIVERABLES</span><br />The following reports will be required: (1) The Contractor shall provide quarterly reports on subjects evaluated, to include the following measures: (a) Rating Scale of Symptoms Item and summary scores from rating scales and interviews listed above; (b) Clinical Interview Summaries; (c) Cognitive Battery Test Scores; (d) Anatomical and Functional Brain imaging data when available; (2) A Final Contract Report summarizing all 150 cases for the above measures. All reports shall be submitted in electronic form as PC-formatted computer files in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and/or searchable PDF format.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span><br />The anticipated period of performance is three (3) years from approximately July 1, 2014 through July 1, 2017.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</span><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541711, 500 employees.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL INFORMATION</span><br />This is a Pre-solicitation Notice in advance of intended solicitation for an intended contract with The University of Pennsylvania. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. There is no solicitation package available.</p>
<p>However, the Government shall consider all written responses received to this Notice.

Training should be provided as part of a quote consistent with ranges of licensed users, and the ability to incrementally add further training should be available. The ability to incrementally add user licenses at any time should be included along with discounts for greater numbers of licenses. In addition, an option to provide a range of facilitation services including meeting design, in-person facilitation, and follow up for agency meetings at which the software system is used should be included.
Specifically, the vendor should provide an enterprise level software platform that has the capacity to provide EPA with a central hub for a wide range of users. The system should be capable of providing different sets of users the ability to: simultaneously or independently review and comment on written documents in electronic format such as PowerPoint presentations or draft reports; concurrently or independently brainstorm large numbers of ideas in a single space with a set of users; simultaneously or independently brainstorm ideas in multiple spaces/on multiple subjects by a single set of users; easily organize and/or categorize information that has been generated; rank, vote, and/or score collected or pre-loaded information; prioritize issues during sessions via several different ranking methods; track assignments, progress, and workflows after completion of sessions; and generate editable reports immediately following sessions in multiple data formats such as MS Word or P DF. The system should allow the host to control the level of anonymity for participants.
PRICE: Submit itemized prices for services described above for enterprise level software platform(s); purchasing of user licenses; online, combined telephone and online, and in-person training; facilitation services for meetings. Pricing should also be provided for a base period and 4 option periods.  Discounts for volume or term of licensing should be included, as appropriate.

Basis for Award: Award will be made to the responsible vendor whose quotation is most advantageous to the government on a best value basis, price and other factors considered. In addition to the quote, provide three past performance references for similar projects. 
As a result of this RFQ, award will be made for the initial purchase of the enterprise level software platform with optional line items to purchase additional licenses, training and facilitation on an as needed basis over the potential 5 year period of performance; or a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) may be issued for those items.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 811219 for an upcoming requirement for the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center at the Federal Center in Denver, CO for maintenance services for JEOL scanning electron microscope model number JSM-5800LV CLD and model number JXA-8900 scanning microprobe.  The offeror must have JEOL factory trained and authorized service engineers with current and specified training for these microscope models that can respond to on-site service calls within 24 hours.  There shall be a minimum of two factory trained and authorized service engineers with specific training for the JOEL JXA 8900 Electron Microprobe and the JOEL JSM-5800LV CLD as well as other factory trained engineers that can be brought in if the primary service engineers are unavailable to meet critical response times.  Response time for on-site service calls must be within 24 hours.  A preventive maintenance (PM) shall be performed on both pieces of equipment at least twice per contract year and prices shall include all consumable parts for PM service performed.  It is critical that the successful offeror have immediate access to JEOL replacement parts for these models, due to the equipments criticality to the USGS geologic discipline mission. Replacement parts must be made available within 24 hours of the initial service call, performance and repairs must be completed within 2 business days of a service call that cannot be resolved with telephone support, with a requirement of zero down time for the instruments. The successful offeror shall provide telephone support for repair and maintenance Monday through Friday 8:30 AM to 5 PM, MST, except holidays.  The offeror must also have authorization for direct communication with the JEOL manufacturer in Japan for issues such as software maintenance and software upgrades and perform upgrades/updates as deemed necessary by the equipment manufacturer. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 
Project Description: The USGS maintains and operates a JEOL model number 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL model number JXA-8900 electron microprobe located in the Denver Microbeam Laboratory, Building 20, Denver Federal Center.  The instruments provide critical analytical research data for geologic discipline programs.  The instruments also provide data for USGS and other federal agency (OFA) clients. The two fully automated instruments operate daily, overnight and weekends.  The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe are often scheduled weeks to months in advance including scheduling for out of town researchers who travel to Denver specifically to use these instruments.  The instruments are both comprised of several critical subsystems including an electron optical column, an electronics console, PC, and a variety of data output devices.  The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe must be maintained in full operating condition and to the manufacturers specifications at all times.  This is necessary because of the strict scientific requirements of Mission area scientists as well as the Mission Areas obligations to OFA clients.  In order to meet these requirements, a full service contract for instrument preventative maintenance and repair is critical.  The instruments must be maintained with highest priority service by JEOL factory trained, authorized service personnel in order to ensure proper maintenance and repair and to prevent damage to the instruments.    A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.

<a href="mailto:michael.d.ashworth@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is soliciting proposals on an unrestricted basis with a portion of the awards set-aside for small businesses for the Operation and Maintenance Engineering Enhancement Program (OMEE) under solicitation W912DY-12-R-0025.  In order to accomplish this mission, CEHNC proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately 15 days or later after the release of this announcement. <br>  <br> Operations and maintenance (O&M) and repair services for Department of Defense (DoD) medical and supporting  non-medical facilities required under the OMEE program include facility operations, scheduled maintenance, unscheduled (corrective) maintenance, repair/replacement/renovation of facility functional areas, systems and equipment, hospital aseptic services (housekeeping), grounds maintenance, abatement, pest management, medical equipment maintenance/repair/replacement, and specialized O&M services.  Facility systems will include all mechanical, electrical, architectural, utility, and site systems, equipment and components.  Some operation and maintenance funded construction, involving the alteration, renovation, conversion, and/or reconfiguration of rooms, areas, and/or facility systems of real property facilities, is required to support the continual operation, maintenance and use of these facilities, systems, and equipment. This construction is expected to be minor in effort, not technically complex, of short duration, not requiring extensive oversight and will not move load bearing walls nor add usable square footage to the facility footprint.  OMEE program O&M services will be performed in DoD medical and supporting non-medical facilities including hospitals, clinics, administrative, pharmacies, veterinarian, dental, training, research, utility and energy plants, labs, and storage facilities as well as some non-medical facilities which support these medical facilities. <br>  <br> The value of the planned acquisition, including all exercised option periods, will be approximately $990 million.  Any awarded contracts will be for a 1-year base ordering period and four 1-year option periods.  The geographic scope of the contracted services under this acquisition will cover the United States (CONUS) as well as Alaska, Hawaii, and all U.S. Territories and possessions and may include overseas locations (OCONUS). It is the intention of CEHNC to award eight performance-based ID/IQ type contracts pursuant to FAR 16.504, of which at least four will be set-aside for small businesses.  However, the Government reserves the right to award more, less or none at all. <br>  <br> Under each contract, task orders may be awarded as firm fixed-price (FFP), time-and-materials (T&M) or some combination of the two. It is anticipated that approximately 90 percent of the task order efforts will be FFP.   It is estimated that no more than 5% of the requirement will utilize T&M pricing (for emergency situations only) and that approximately 10% of the requirement will be for construction efforts subject to the Davis Bacon Act.   <br>  <br> The RFP will be available electronically at https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>This is not a new posting. The pre-solicitation synopsis was posted on November 15, 2013 and archived on January 14, 2014.  <br>   <br> The RFP is available electronically at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_view.cfm?psolicitationnbr=W912DY12R0025  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is soliciting proposals on an unrestricted basis with a portion of the awards set-aside for small businesses for the Operation and Maintenance Engineering Enhancement Program (OMEE) under solicitation W912DY-12-R-0025.  In order to accomplish this mission, CEHNC proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.    <br>  <br> Operations and maintenance (O&M) and repair services for Department of Defense (DoD) medical and supporting  non-medical facilities required under the OMEE program include facility operations, scheduled maintenance, unscheduled (corrective) maintenance, repair/replacement/renovation of facility functional areas, systems and equipment, hospital aseptic services (housekeeping), grounds maintenance, abatement, pest management, medical equipment maintenance/repair/replacement, and specialized O&M services.  Facility systems will include all mechanical, electrical, architectural, utility, and site systems, equipment and components.  Some operation and maintenance funded construction, involving the alteration, renovation, conversion, and/or reconfiguration of rooms, areas, and/or facility systems of real property facilities, is required to support the continual operation, maintenance and use of these facilities, systems, and equipment. This construction is expected to be minor in effort, not technically complex, of short duration, not requiring extensive oversight and will not move load bearing walls nor add usable square footage to the facility footprint.  OMEE program O&M services will be performed in DoD medical and supporting non-medical facilities including hospitals, clinics, administrative, pharmacies, veterinarian, dental, training, research, utility and energy plants, labs, and storage facilities as well as some non-medical facilities which support these medical facilities. <br>  <br> The value of the planned acquisition, including all exercised option periods, will be approximately $990 million.  Any awarded contracts will be for a 1-year base ordering period and four 1-year option periods.  The geographic scope of the contracted services under this acquisition will cover the United States (CONUS) as well as Alaska, Hawaii, and all U.S. Territories and possessions and may include overseas locations (OCONUS). It is the intention of CEHNC to award eight performance-based ID/IQ type contracts pursuant to FAR 16.504, of which at least four will be set-aside for small businesses.  However, the Government reserves the right to award more, less or none at all.   <br>

<DESC>Please review the attached document for more&nbsp;details and&nbsp;response directions.<br /><br />&nbsp;The BLS of the U.S Department of Labor is the principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy. Its mission is to collect, analyze, and disseminate essential economic information to support public and private decision making. BLS has historically used a mainframe service center to support a variety of data processing requirements. In recent years, most of that processing has migrated to UNIX and/or Windows systems. One BLS program, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program, continues to use mainframe processing for some of its data processing. QCEW is expected to continue with a mainframe workload similar to its recent usage for the next four years, before it begins to migrate production to other platforms.<br /><br />The QCEW program produces a comprehensive series of employment and wage data for workers covered by State unemployment insurance (UI) laws and is a virtual census of payroll employment. The program produces data on establishments, monthly employment, and quarterly wages by industry, county, and ownership. <br />The QCEW program is a Federal/State cooperative program, with the cooperating state agencies (50 states, D.C, and two territories) performing most of the data collection and editing, and performing aggregation and analysis of data for their own states and areas. The state-edited data is accessed by the BLS national office to produce and publish data at the national, state, and county levels, as well as for other areas. At the state level, the activities begin with input files created by state UI agencies. These files are processed by one of two purpose built systems. The mainframe system, known collectively as EXPO, is used by 39 of the agencies, 36 of whom use it at the BLS contracted service center, and 3 of them use it on state operated mainframes. The remaining 14 agencies use a PC and network based system to perform the similar function.<br />The EXPO system uses a combination of batch processing and a CICS started task to meet the programs' needs. TSO sessions are used for variety of purposes, including, but not limited to: job submission, job monitoring, print routing, file transmission, and source code and system maintenance. The EXPO system uses a variety of standard z/OS utilities, and the program specific code for both the batch jobs and the CICS system is COBOL - typically the most current and widely available version, but only using widely available language features so that the system can be used at both the service center facility and those used by the three states that run it separately.<br />Currently, almost all data enters or leaves the EXPO hosting service center via FTP file transmission. A small and declining number of files is sent in by tape cartridge (via common carrier - FedEx, UPS, etc.). The states upload and/or read the UI system provided files, edit and analyze them via EXPO batch and interactive sessions, and make files available for downloading to BLS users and for other purposes as needed by the states. <br /><br />The contract with the current BLS mainframe service provider will expire in the coming year, and BLS is seeking information from vendors that can provide this service. The current vendor provides BLS an LPAR of a size and capacity that was required to meet the significantly larger BLS workload of prior years. A somewhat smaller capacity may be adequate to meet the anticipated workload going forward. That said, the following details of the current service provider's environment should help potential respondents determine if the BLS workload is suitable for their capabilities.

Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting healthy behaviors such as eating nutritious foods, being physically active and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases.<br />CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) is at the forefront of the nation's efforts to prevent and control chronic diseases. The center conducts studies to better understand the causes of these diseases, supports programs to promote healthy behaviors, and monitors the health of the nation through surveys. Critical to the success of these efforts are partnerships with state health and education agencies, voluntary associations, private organizations, and other federal agencies. Together, the center and its partners are working to create a healthier nation<br />CDC supports a variety of programs to improve the nation's health by preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors. These programs provide national leadership by offering guidelines and recommendations and by helping state health and education agencies promote healthy behaviors. These major programs include: Arthritis, Cancer Control, Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW), Community Transformation Grants (CTG), Diabetes; Epilepsy, Healthy Communities, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), Healthy Aging, Healthy Youth, Heart Disease and Stroke , Nutrition and Physical Activity , Oral Health, Prevention Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHS) Block Grant, Prevention Research Centers, Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), Reproductive Health, Tobacco, WISEWOMAN, Workplace Health Promotion. <br />The CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) accomplishes its mission by providing national leadership in areas of health promotion and chronic disease prevention by conducting public health surveillance, epidemiologic studies, and behavioral interventions; by disseminating guidelines and recommendations; and by assisting state health and education agencies to increase their capacity to prevent chronic diseases and promote healthful behaviors. <br />The mission could not be accomplished without many diverse partners: state and local health and education departments; other federal health agencies; international and national health organizations; academic institutions; philanthropic foundations; industry and labor groups; and professional, voluntary and community organizations.

Instrument control, data acquisition, and data analysis are accomplished through the Probe for EPMA software v10.x and Probe Image software that is commercially available through Probe Software, Inc.</p>
<p>Recent analysis challenges at NIST have required NIST researchers to push the limits of the Probe for EPMA software. Advanced level knowledge of the inner workings of the software package is required to be able to complete the required analyses and to do it in an efficient manner. As such, an advanced level understanding in the application and use of the Probe for EPMA is required.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responsible sources that are qualified to train advanced users on the Probe for EPMA v10.x and Probe Image software on a JEOL 8500F EPMA instrument. Qualified trainers shall be nationally recognized experts in the field of x-ray micro-analysis, via EPMA, using wavelength dispersive and energy dispersive spectrometers.</p>

<p>Any responsible sources that currently possess such capabilities and have prior experience providing services using this expertise are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing the following information:</p>
<p>1. Documentation which clearly shows the resource has a proven record training scientific staff on the Probe for EMPA v10.x software and that the resource meets the above criteria for providing qualified trainers;<br />2.

Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>After the results of this Sources Sought Notice are obtained and assessed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two (2) qualified small business resources are identified during this market research phase, then any competitive procurement pursuant to this Notice will be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>No telephone requests will be honored. All information provided will become property of NIST and will not be returned.</p>
<p>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of their capability statement assessment.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is announcing its plans and intent to pursue continuation, via a full and open competitive Request for Proposals (RFP), of its active and ongoing clinical research investigations of stroke and traumatic brain injury conducted by the NINDS Stroke Branch, Section of on Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics, NIH, (hereinafter identified as NINDS SDTS) that have been provided under a series of contracts since 1999. The NIH/NINDS Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics Section (SDTS) was formed in 1999 with the mission of performing innovative translational research in acute stroke. In 2008, the SDTS expanded to include the study of TBI. The SDTS has been primarily focusing on studying acute stroke and TBI with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal of the SDTS is to make scientific advances toward new stroke therapies through the development, validation, and testing of imaging markers for use in clinical trials and practice and to improve the understanding, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of TBI.</p>
<p>This project is a continuation of a long-term collaborative effort the NINDS SDTS has had with local hospitals (10+ years) to provide clinical support services conduct clinical research into acute cerebrovascular diseases and traumatic brain injury. Due to the requirement to see patients during the acute phase of their stroke or brain injury the research program cannot be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center (CC). Thus this internal research effort has been supported and conducted at off-site acute care hospitals.</p>
<p>We are seeking to identify any acute care facility that might be interested in competing and is capable of performing and providing the requisite services for continuation of this requirement for a five (5) year term.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:<br />The proposed acquisition is to acquire clinical support services of an acute care hospital (hereafter identified as the Contractor) located within 15 miles of the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD (9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892) to support the clinical and research efforts of the NIH/NINDS Stroke Branch, Section on Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics (SDTS). This acquisition provides an acute care hospital setting for SDTS research staff to access, recruit and study acute stroke and acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The overall program is designed to study the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the clinical evaluation of acute stroke and TBI patients, and to develop acute stroke therapies. Although the Contractor will not be conducting any of the research under this program, they will be providing support and clinical services including but not limited to: patient identification and referral; MRI support for imaging of prospective research subjects; vascular neurologist services; nursing services; neurosurgical and neuroradiological services; interventional radiology services; emergency preparation and blinding of study drugs by a hospital pharmacist; chemistry and hematological laboratory tests required by the NIH/NINDS Stroke Team research protocols and NIH/NINDS Stroke Care Pathway; general radiological services; neurointensive care and monitoring.</p>
<p>One of the primary aims of the clinical research efforts of the SDTS is to include MRI procedures in standard clinical care protocols to determine the specificity and sensitivity of MRI in the evaluation of this patient population. These stroke and TBI research studies require high volumes of acute patient populations that can only be found in an acute care hospital. In order to continue to advance this field of research the SDTS needs their research program to be located in a local acute care hospital that has the existing capability to receive and triage patients with acute cerebrovascular disease and the capability to immediately provide 24/7 access to MRI to aid in the diagnosis and study of these patients.</p>
<p>The SDTS team will fully integrate with the hospital's medical staff and will be available 24/7 to evaluate patients who present to the Contractor's hospital with symptoms of an acute cerebrovascular disease. The Contractor will not be developing any research trials under this contract. Research trials will be developed by the SDTS team and will be conducted by the SDTS team at the Contractor's hospital subject to appropriate IRB approval. Enrollment and treatment of patients into research studies will be performed by the SDTS team at the Contractor's hospital. The Contractor's hospital staff will aid in the identification and referral of patients to the SDTS team for possible recruitment into research trials. The Contractor will provide clinical support services (nursing, physician, radiology, pharmacist, etc) for these studies.</p>
<p>Therefore, at a minimum, there are critical elements that an acute care facility would need to have in place and operational, or be able to establish prior to award. The critical elements are as follows: 1) Demonstrate hospital is located within 15 miles of the NIH campus (9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892); 2) Demonstrate hospital has MRI scanner (1.5T or 3T) in close proximity to the Emergency Room; 3) Demonstrate hospital can make the MRI scanner immediately available 24/7 for use in the diagnosis of acute stroke and TBI patients; 4) Demonstrate hospital has achievement of Stroke Center Certification by The Joint Commission and, for hospitals in Maryland, the additional designation as a Stroke Center by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medicine Services Systems Stroke (MIEMSS); 5) Demonstrate stroke admissions of at least 400 stroke patients per year; and 6) Demonstrate hospital has experience with conduct and support of acute care research studies.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: Submitted Capability Statements must adequately address the six critical elements enumerated above.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The purpose of this announcement is to obtain responses from organizations who might be interested in and capable of meeting the needs of this NINDS requirement.

NAVAIR, PEO (U&amp;W), and PMA-201 is seeking information from industry regarding the evolutionary improvement to the FMU-139 performance characteristics via the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Spec PMA201-12-001. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.</p>
<p>General Description: The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139C/B is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to identify potential cost and/or schedule drivers that would impact a potential source from being able to build to the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, or any other improvements that could be incorporated with minimal cost/schedule impact. The Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources which detail the below areas of interest. Responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how concepts were developed and methodologies used that could satisfy stated requirements, including a top level description of the proposed upgrade concept, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, verification and validation of capability concepts, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, future technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any newly proposed concept including key subsystems and methodology used to determine TRL, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for any newly proposed concept and methodology used to determine MRL. Key areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Comments to DRAFT Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, including the identification of any requirements that are significant cost drivers. Provide specific cost/schedule impact with recommendations.<br />&bull; Hardened target capability to 10,000 PSI. Identify the specific cost increase, schedule impacts, and changes required to current/future production lines and manufacturing processes needed to include this requirement. <br />&bull; Multi-layer target penetration capabilities, equating to up to four (4) six (6) inch layers of 5,000-psi concrete or equivalent, commensurate to a standard multi-story facility construction.<br />&bull; FZU-48 performance in high altitude/low airspeed (HALA) environments, specifically associated with the MQ-9 platform. Identification of potential turbine generator replacement systems to address HALA requirements, as well as cost/schedule impacts .<br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems that could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons. Additionally how alternatives would be incorporated into current manufacturing and production lines, and the cost/schedule impact of incorporating these alternatives.</p>

Spinal Cord Injury - Vocational Integration Program: 
Predictive Model over Time for Employment (PrOMOTE)
VA RR&D O7814-R

Fidelity Monitoring
Statement of Work

Background:
In 2005, VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (VA RR&D) funded a research proposal called Spinal Cord Injury-Vocational Integration Program (SCI-VIP) that merged two disciplines, vocational rehabilitation services through CWT Programs and Spinal Cord Centers in Milwaukee, Dallas, San Diego, Houston and Cleveland.  The SCI-VIP research was endorsed by VACO's Office of Mental Health and Office of Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders, as well as VA's Committee on Rehabilitation (VACOR) and Paralyzed Veterans of America Headquarters.  

As a result of the successful findings from the SCI-VIP study, VA RR&D funded the SCI-VIP: Predictive Outcome Model Over Time for Employment (PrOMOTE; O7814-R) to measure the effectiveness of Evidence Based Supported Employment (EBSE) practices on a longitudinal basis.  
 
Fidelity monitoring is a critical component of implementing EBSE. Programs use fidelity rating scales to monitor adherence to the evidence-based principles of Supported Employment (SE) and to provide technical coaching to vocational rehabilitation specialists (VRSs) and guidance to program managers and leaders at these facilities.

Scope
This contract is for an experienced EBSE reviewer to conduct the bi-annual fidelity ratings for the PrOMOTE study at its seven research sites and attend and/or present at meetings as requested by the study's Executive Committee.

2.	Complete the Fidelity Scale Adapted for VA during the review (see Appendix C. Supported Employment Fidelity Scale Adapted for VA). 
3.	Collaborate with the Fidelity Review team on the Fidelity Visit reports. 
4.	Travel, attend, and/or present at the SCI-VIP: PrOMOTE annual meeting and/or on an ad hoc basis as requested by the Executive Committee. 
Delivery
At the conclusion of each fidelity monitoring visit, the contractor will submit a brief of observations and recommendations for training and support modifications related to the delivery of VRS services and the partnership with CWT.

At the conclusion of each meeting the Executive Committee requests the contractor to attend and/or present, the contractor will submit a brief to include observations and recommendations.

Period of Performance
This contract is for January 1, 2014 thru December 31, 2014.

Payment
For each completed fidelity monitoring visit, the contractor will be paid $3,500 for an expected three days of work (1: travel to site, 2: first day of visit, and 3: the second day of the visit and return trip home).

For each SCI-VIP: PrOMOTE meeting the contractor attends per the request of the SCI-VIP: PrOMOTE Executive Committee, the contractor will be paid $4,000 for an expected four days of work (1: travel to meeting location, 2: meeting day 1, 3: meeting day 2, 4: return trip home).

Invoices
The contractor will be paid monthly in arrears after receipt of invoice and the aforementioned deliverables. The invoice must reference both the contract number and the purchase order number.

<a href="mailto:david.d.robledo.civ@mail.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>RFI - Army Dental Command (DENCOM) Dental Services <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of Army Dental Command (DENCOM), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with the analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues. <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication that CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future Solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government's requirement is to obtain a personal services contract to provide dental services to eligible beneficiaries of the military health care system in support of the Army Dental Command (DENCOM) for performance within the Continental United States (CONUS) to include Alaska and Hawaii.  These services are to be performed by doctors in the disciplines of General Dentistry, Endodontists, and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.  Ancillary support includes Dental Hygienists, Dental Assistants, Dental Therapy Assistants, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Dental Assistants, Dental Laboratory Technicians, Porcelain Ceramists Laboratory Technicians, and Dental Ceramo-Metal Laboratory Technicians.  Contract Service Providers (CSPs) will work under the control and general supervision of the DENTAC Commander and/or Officer-in-Charge of the Dental Clinic, or his or her representative.  This requirement is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity task order type contract with composite burdened labor rate pricing on a Firm Fixed Priced basis.  This will result in the award of three (3) separate regional contracts consisting of performance in the following regions:  (1) Northern Regional Dental Command (RDC); (2) Southern RDC; and (3) Western RDC and Pacific RDC (two RDC's combined) (see Exhibit C, DENCOM Clinic Locations).  When a solicitation is issued, offerors will have the opportunity to propose on one, two or all three regions.  Composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> This personal services requirement is intended to create an employer-employee relationship between the Government and the individual contract Health Care Providers (HCPs) only to the extent necessary for providing the dental services required under this contract.  The performance of dental services by the individual contract HCPs are subject to the same day-to-day supervision and control by health care facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service HCPs engaged in the delivery of comparable dental services.  The contract HCPs shall work under the direction and general supervision of the Dental Activity (DENTAC) Commander or his Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Dental Clinic.  All persons performing work under the contract shall be and shall remain employees of the contractor and are not employees of the Government.  A  quote mark draft quote mark  Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) that might result from this survey would have a period of performance of a base year and 4 one-year options.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 621210 and the small business size standard is $7.0M.  <br>  <br> The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the Army DENCOM requirements.  We recommend that you first review the  quote mark draft quote mark  PWS so that you may have a better insight on the questions below. <br>  <br> 1.  What are the customary commercial practices for providing these types of services for non-governmental entities, e.g., contract type, pricing structure, task order driven contract, etc.?   <br>  <br> 2.  Reference PWS paragraph 5.4, On-Call Services.  What are the customary commercial practices for providing on-call services for non-governmental entities?   <br>  <br> 3.  Based on your experience, what is the most cost effective contract type and payment method (i.e., monthly firm fixed-price, separate price per service (price list), cost reimbursement, or combination, etc.)? <br>  <br> 4.  Is 30 days a sufficient amount of time for a contractor to prepare a proposal given the scenario of a full trade-off best value source selection requiring a technical and price proposal, as well as past performance references?  If 30 days is not sufficient, please provide a reasonable timeframe to prepare a proposal and rational for your time frame. <br>  <br> 5.  We anticipate a 2-month transition period for the contractor to perform pre-contract functions in order to be ready to begin full performance of the PWS by the contract start date.  This effort will not be separately priced in the contract.  These efforts include but are not limited to:  personnel recruitment and hiring efforts; complete credentialing and employment packages, training, security requirements, obtaining CACs and completion of an inventory changeover of Government furnished equipment/material, when applicable.  Is a 2-month period a sufficient amount of time?  Based on your experience for similar efforts, should this period be shorter or longer and if so explain why?  Does the PWS paragraph 1.6.1. address all the efforts that may be entailed in a transition-in period? <br>  <br> 6.  When nearing completion of this type of contract, is a 2-month transition-out period adequate (see PWS 1.6.2.)?  If not, what do you recommend? <br>  <br> 7.  Do you have a catalog or other published product literature including pricing for these or similar services?  If so, please provide this information. <br>  <br> 8.  Does your company have standard commercial rates utilized for private industry contracts for these types of services?  If so, please describe.  If not, are you aware of other companies that have commercial rates for these types of services?  If so, please explain. <br>  <br> 9.  Do you have a GSA schedule for this type of requirement with composite rates covering the RDC regions?  If so, are there any labor categories that are not included in your schedule?  Regarding Exhibit C, are there any performance locations that would not be included on the GSA schedule? <br>  <br> 10.  Can a single composite rate be developed for each labor category to cover pricing for the geographically dispersed locations within each of the 3 regional contracts (see Enclosure 1, Estimated FTEs and Exhibit C, DENCOM Clinic Locations)?  Note:  For the combined Western and Pacific RDCs, composite rates will be requested separately for each RDC. <br>  <br> 11.  The Government will provide the performance locations by region and the estimated labor hours per labor category.  Is there any other type of data do you recommend the government provide to industry in order for you to provide composite burdened firm fixed price labor rates (within each region) that are realistic? <br>  <br> 12.  Are any of the labor categories (e.g., General Dentistry, Endodontists, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Dental Hygienists, etc.) difficult to recruit and retain?   <br> Also, are any of the locations within each region (Exhibit C) considered  quote mark hard to fill quote mark  areas?  If so, please identify the positions/locations and provide an explanation. <br>  <br> 13.  Are the required performance measures in the Performance Requirements Summary (Exhibit B to PWS) achievable?  If not, please be specific on which areas would not be and state the reasons why and provide recommendations. <br>  <br> 14.  Are there any innovative approaches used by your company for this type of service?  If so, please explain. <br>  <br> 15.  What makes your company a market leader for this type of service? <br>  <br> 16.  Do you have past performance for similar Dental Services in this PWS at multiple geographically dispersed locations of similar magnitude?   If so, please provide the following information for each relevant contract:  (1) name of your customer; (2) contract number; (3) contract start date; (4) contract length; (5) total dollar value for all periods; (6) place of performance; (7) type of labor categories; and (8) a brief description of services.  ?   <br>  <br> 17.  For NAICS 621210 - Offices of Dentists, Small Business Size Standard $7.0M, is your company considered a small business?  If your company is a small business, do you fall under any small business subcategory (SDB, SDVOSB, Hub Zoned, 8a, etc)?  If you are an 8a eligible company, please provide current status regarding your scheduled graduation date from the 8a program under this NAICS code. <br>  <br> 18.  If you are considered a large business, is there a possibility you may contemplate teaming with a small business for this requirement? <br>  <br> 19.  What is your company's average revenue for the past 3 years? <br>  <br> 20.  What types of internal Quality Control (QC) performance assessment methods are commonly used by your company for dental services?  Would it differ for a personal services contract? <br>  <br> 21.  Would your company be interested in pursuing a Government contract for any of the following regions:  (1) Northern Regional Dental Command (RDC); (2) Southern RDC; and (3) Western RDC and Pacific RDC?  If so, please specify which regions you are interested in. <br>  <br> 22.  Does your company currently possess adequate staffing or have the capability to support one or all of the regions that you are interested in with the required labor categories?  If so, please describe your staffing capabilities. <br>  <br> 23.  Does your company have a limit to the number of dentists and ancillary personnel that can be managed by your company?  If so, what are your limitations by position type? <br>  <br> 24.  For these services, would your company hire professional personnel (dentists) and ancillary personnel as actual employees of your company or would they be hired as subcontractors? <br>  <br> 25.  Discuss any concerns, comments or recommendations you may have with the attached  quote mark draft quote mark  PWS or any related Attachments/Exhibits.  Please reference the applicable PWS paragraph numbers with each comment. <br>  <br> Request for Capability Statement:  Respondents to this RFI are requested to describe their interest and ability/capability to perform the dental services in the PWS enclosed with this notice by submitting a capability statement. <br>  <br> Responses should contain your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 621210 (size standard $7,000,000).

The information gained will assist in developing the acquisition for Engineering and Strategic Support Services for the Office of the Chief Management Officer (ODCMO) (http://dcmo.defense.gov/). The Department of Defense (DoD), Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Acquisition Directorate (AD) is issuing this notice to request feedback from industry about capability of accomplishing the requirement as follows:
<p>I. Engineering Support: including Technology Subject Matter Expertise and support, Business Enterprise Architecture support, System Engineering (SE) support, Business Systems Support, and Program Management Support as listed in Attachment 1 Engineering Support Draft PWS.</p>
<p>II. Strategic Support: including Strategic Planning and Reporting Support, Governance (Identification, Select &amp; Control), and Business System/IT Lifecycle Evaluation as listed in Attachment 2 Engineering Support Draft PWS.</p>
<p>To this end, the WHS Acquisition Directorate is seeking the following information from interested companies with respect to the following items/questions:</p>
<p>1. Briefly identify your firm's capability to perform all the task areas as listed above.</p>
<p>2. Does your firm's total annual revenue exceed $14M? Does your firm qualify for any socio-economic groups as indicated in SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search?</p>
<p>3. Does your firm have GSA schedules, GWAC, or participate in any other Government schedules or programs? If so, identify how the scope of work will fall within your firm's capability to perform the subject task areas.</p>
<p>4. The Government anticipates soliciting the task areas via two distinct agreements using firm-fixed price orders to the maximum extent possible. The Government would like to know if this represents the most effective acquisition plan for obtaining these services. Can a single firm perform all of the requirements? Is there a more logical strategy for acquiring the services (e.g. 3 or more agreements)?</p>

<CONTACT>Marc Concilio, 443-861-4790

<a href="mailto:marc.a.concilio.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>1.  Notice of Intent: <br>  <br> The Government anticipates extending the above reference contract CLIN 2001 to Lockheed Martin Corporation. The purpose of the modification is to extend the Period of Performance (PoP) of CLIN 2001 by six (6) months.  The services that are anticipated to be extended under CLIN 2001 will provide for field service representative (FSR) support and hardware repairs during Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).  The Government has a need for this extended support and exercising CLIN 2001 is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's need, price, and other factors considered.  <br>  <br> 2.  Introduction:  <br>  <br> a. Program Overview:  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known current and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar capable of detecting projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  The AN/TPQ-53 will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.  <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Brigade combat teams and fires brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counter fire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations. <br>  <br> b. Procurement History:  On 29 February 2012, the Government competitively awarded a firm fixed price/cost plus fixed fee contract.  The contract was to procure up to a quantity of 67 AN/TPQ-53 production assets, of which qty 52 LRIP assets were procured.  The contract was also to procure contractor support services in support of the aforementioned systems.The table below provides major contract milestone information relevant to the procurement actions.   <br>  <br> Contract Number	Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015 <br> CLIN 0101	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Full and open competition <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015 <br> CLIN 0201	15 Mar 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015 <br> CLIN 2001	16 Aug 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015 <br> CLIN 0206	26 Jun 13	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br>  <br> 3.  Acquisition Approach: <br>  <br> a. CLIN Information:  CLIN 2001 is a Firm Fixed Price CLIN.  CLIN 2001 was awarded under modification P00005 on 16 August 2012 and currently has a performance completion date of 30 March 2014. <br>  <br> b. Contract Requirements:  During the anticipated extension, the contractor shall provide the Government the following support for Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E): <br>  <br> IOT&E support shall be conducted on-site; for six (6) weeks; seven (7) days a week; and twenty-four (24) hours per day.   <br>  <br> On-site test support will include five (5) FSRs supporting 24 hour mission cycles, two first shift technical supports, and a Team Lead for the first two weeks of the event. Additionally, systems support to analyze performance data may be required. <br>  <br> Preparations for IOT&E:  The five systems to be used for IOT&E must be maintained in accordance with the PMCS schedule as identified in the LRIP Operator and Maintainer technical manuals. The systems must also undergo 72 hour functional checkouts at 60 days prior to and 30 days prior to IOT&E NET.  Any and all deficiencies must be corrected and validated prior to system handover, 5 days prior to IOT&E NET. <br>  <br> Additionally, support during the IOT&E will require five (5) FSRs to provide maintenance above and beyond operator and maintainer level maintenance, as well as maintenance on the Environmental Control Unit (ECU) and 10kW Generators mounted on the Operations Control Shelter during the IOT&E operations.   <br>  <br> The Contractor support will also include post-IOT&E data analysis to verify system performance and reliability.  This will require engineering support of Test Incident Reports (TIRs) and additional data to provide root cause/fault tree analysis, to generate Significant Problem Reports SPRs, and to provide a recommended corrective action addressing any priority 1 or 2 SPRs, TIRs scored as system aborts or essential function failures, and any other TIR identified by PdM Radars as critical.  <br>  <br> Technical Manual V&V support will be needed for five (5) weeks, five (5) days a week, and eight (8) hours a day.  This support will include an FSR, technical support and Technical Manual Writer.  This support will be conducted at the contractor facility.  <br>  <br> Low Quadrant Elevation (QE) shot trajectories & Hi Clutter Environments support will be needed. The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel and equipment in order to define the performance for the Radars design tracking in Hi Clutter Environments and Low QE Trajectories. This work is anticipated to be conducted at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona during a 30 day period and will also require analysis and modeling that compares current performance to test data collected, reduced and analyzed from a system performing in Hi Clutter Environments and Low QE Trajectories. Specific recommendations to improve Radar System performance and implementation of improvements in these areas shall be provided.  <br>  <br> 4.  Additional Information: <br>  <br> a. PdM Radars has limited data rights to the system Software for the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System, the majority of the software rights are owned by Lockheed Martin Corporation. The effort associated with CLIN 2001 was originally to be performed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to support to the AN/TPQ-53 IOT&E; the scope of work as detailed above encompasses Field Service Representative (FSR) to support IOT&E, reach back engineering support for issues discovered during IOT&E, and post IOT&E data analysis. <br>   <br> b. IOT&E was originally scheduled to occur 28 October through 22 November 2013, however due to the Government shutdown and the restrictions on travel IOT&E had to be rescheduled to 28 April thru 18 May 2014.  These dates are after the end of the current period of performance of CLIN 2001 which is 31 March 2014.  The additional six (6) months of support is necessary to cover the current IOT&E and to allow the Government to receive and review IOT&E data. The Government will receive the data ten (10) days after the end of test approximately 18 May 2014. From that point on, the Government has fifty (50) days to work with other Government agencies to complete independent assessments of the IOT&E data.  Sixty (60) days after the end of the event Army Test and Evaluation Command will provide their operational evaluation report (OER) to the Product Manager (PdM) at which point the PdM has fifteen (15) days to provide a rebuttal statement. The rebuttal statement will require the results of the Government assessment and additional analysis with Lockheed Martin and the PdM Subject Matter Experts.   <br>  <br> c. This notice of intent is being provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered a request for proposal (RFP).  All responses received within fifteen days after this publication of this notice of intent shall be considered by the Government.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Any unclassified questions regarding this notice of intent may be sent directly to the Contracting Officer via email. <br>  <br> All documentation submitted shall become the property of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to utilize and share with industry any information suggested, unless information is identified with proprietary or business sensitive markings and unique to your company.  <br>  <br> 5.

<DESC>This justification supports the award of an out of scope modification to a GSA Schedule 70 task order with Terremark Federal Group, Inc. to add technology infrastructure and service requirements not contemplated at time of award. The additional services are required to provide sufficient cloud computing to support the operations of the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) and Data Services Hub (DSH). These two projects support the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care reform implementations.
<p>The Contracting Officer considers the work contained in the subject modification to be out of scope and requiring this justification. Both parties could not have contemplated that this additional capacity was required. This additional capacity was not included in the original task order, and therefore the addition of the work is justified and approved with this Limited Sources Justification.</p>
<p>CMS could not have anticipated the need to add these additional services. Previous resource estimates gave CMS reasonable assurance that the capacity procured through this order was sufficient for the expected demands. CMS learned through performance and stress testing conducted on September 26, 2013 that the Terremark cloud would only be able to handle about 10,000 concurrent users. This was far short of the expected peak traffic of 50,000 concurrent users. The task order did not have a specific concurrent user performance requirement. OIS quickly realized that the cloud services would have to be expanded in order to be able to meet the expected user demands. <br />There is insufficient time to competitively procure the needed services. A procurement action like this would normally take about four to six weeks to procure. The exchanges will be operational when the open enrollment period begins on October 1, 2013. CMS believed if the additional services were not added urgently, the Exchanges would not function as designed and citizens would not be able to comparison shop for affordable health care insurance. Modification 10 was executed on September 30, 2013.</p>

<DESC>Notice is given that Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), 2002 Holcombe Blvd Houston, TX 77030,  intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source, RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical,  under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) for Direct-to-Patient Delivery Services.

Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, 2002 Holcombe Blvd Houston, TX 77030, intends to add these delivery services via open market procurement in accordance with FAR 8.402(f) to a local FSS-BPA awarded against Independence Medical's FSS contract, V797D-40017 

This proposed procurement is based on the determination that the government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from only one source. 

A major portion of the requirements and items for this procurement are satisfied by the base terms an item list included in Independence Medical's FSS contract, V797D-40017.

Direct-to-patient delivery services are not part of the base contract and therefore may be added via an open market procurement in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)

The NAICS Code is 423450
The SIN code is 65 II A

The proposed FSS- BPA will incorporate the shipping requirements, to allow the shipment of medical supplies direct to patient's homes.  

This will serve to:

1.	Prevent missed deliveries to patients' when items are unavailable or out-of-stock at the Consolidated Mail Out Patient Pharmacy (CMOP)
2.	Streamline the shipping process from four days to two days by eliminating the shipment from manufacturer to MEDVAMC facility and MEDVAMC Facility to patient
3.	Lessen the need to warehouse products at the MEDVAMC facilities.

The Veterans Affairs Medical Centers Pharmacies requires all contractor's offering direct-to-patient delivery services be approved as a health care provider for shipment of prescription medical supplies and equipment. 
Period of Performance: Base Year plus four twelve month option periods.
Contract Type: Firm Fixed Priced,  Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)
Response date (Deadline):
This notice is neither a request for quotes nor an invitation for bids. It is not a solicitation. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. 

A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

All written responses to this notice received by close of business on Friday, February 7, 2014 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive or sole-source procurement.

The information included in the response should provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements so that a fair assessment can be made. 

Only email responses to the point of contact(s) listed below are acceptable.

The GC portion of the TOFMS is an Agilent component and the mounting kit is made specifically for this instrument.  Maestro software allows full integration of all aspects of sampler method and is integrated into LECO control software.  Maestro provides Prep functions such as dilution, internal standard addition, derivitization , etc., prior to injection.  Maestro allows Prep Ahead of headspace and Solid Phase Micro Extraction(SPME) vials.  The system takes into account incubation, extraction, desorption, and GC runtimes, and calculates the most effective means to move samples in and out of the six positions in the incubator.  Maestro software functions do not require macro writing or programming.  All method choices are selectable in a graphical user interface.  Maestro provides injection counters and reminders for maintenance items.  Maestro provides email alerts if there is a problem with the system.  Upgradeable to Dynamic Headspace, Thermal desorption, Twister, and ALEX (Automated Liner Exchange)  SPME is completely automated, with programmable temperatures, stirring speeds, as well as incubation, extraction, and desorption times.  SPME mode allows the use of on-fiber derivitization with the simple selection of a check box.  SPME incubator is selectable between agitation or stirring - you deci de which works best with your samples.  SPME mode ? capable of incubating and sampling from 2ml, 5ml, 10ml, 20ml 40mL and 100mL vials. Capable of holding up to 96 20mL vials.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>- Contract number.<br />- Contract award date.<br />- Performance start and stop date(s).<br />- Work site(s) or location(s).<br />- As a minimum, the following information for contractor personnel requiring entry/access: full name, social security number (or other identification number), and installation(s)/location(s) to be accessed.<br />- A statement that the social security numbers of the listed employees have been verified with the social security administration (contractors should reference www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnv.htm)</p>
<p>No contractor personnel shall be granted or authorized entry/access until identified on the "Listing of personnel requiring entry/access."</p>
<p>Note 2: Consent forms. Consent forms shall authorize the Air Force to fingerprint contractor personnel and to conduct additional background checks. In general, the consent form will outline the following:</p>

Furthermore, the Contractor shall be responsible for immediately returning all issued identification passes/badges and vehicle passes/decals to the Contracting Officer/designee.</p>
<p>Note 3: Criminal Background History (CBH). Background checks may be obtained from local, county, or state law enforcement authorities; or commercial vendors whose checks include a criminal background history.

<p>- Individual's name.<br />- Social Security Number.<br />- Date of birth.<br />- Address of current residence.<br />- Address of residence(s) over the past two (2) years.<br />- Criminal/Arrest record (felony/misdemeanor) since the 18th Birthday.<br />- Information on the locality(ies) checked (i.e., local, county, state, and/or federal).<br />- List of outstanding wants and warrants.</p>
<p>Depending upon local, county, or state regulations, the background check may be obtained by the contractor or the contractor personnel.</p>
<p>"Favorable" background checks will not contain any of the following negative screening criteria (i.e., "disqualifying factors"):</p>
<p>- U.S. citizenship, immigration status, or Social Security Account Number cannot be verified.<br />- Barred from entry/access to any military installation or facility.<br />- Wanted by federal or civil law enforcement authorities, regardless of offense/violation (i.e., an "order to arrest" has been issued by a judge).<br />- Conviction of a firearms or explosive violation within the past three years.<br />- Incarcerated for 12 months or longer within the past three years, regardless of offense/violation. <br />- Any conviction for espionage, sabotage, treason or terrorism, or murder.<br />- A conviction of sexual assault, armed assault/robbery, rape, child molestation, drugs possession with intent to sell, or drug distribution within the past ten years. <br />- Name appears on any federal agency's "watch list" or "hit list" for criminal behavior or terrorist activity.</p>
<p>Each background check shall be considered "current" for a 24-month period and valid for all contracts performed within the 24-month period of currency. Contractors shall ensure background checks are accomplished every 24 months to ensure no lapse in background check coverage. This requirement does not apply to contractor personnel that have a favorable government personnel security background investigation that is valid for a period longer than two years.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel who have a current, favorable government personnel security background investigation that is electronically accessible and immediately verifiable by the Government within the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) are not required to obtain an additional background check for the purposes of complying with this requirement (i.e., existing current, favorable security background investigations may be used in lieu of these requirements).</p>

DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION

This is a Statement of Work (SOW) addressing wireless modems transmitting the usage recorded on a PAP device to a data base.  The purpose of these devices is to regularly maintain compliance tracking of the patient's PAP unit usage.
A.	OVERVIEW
Veterans on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) need to be closely managed to ensure effective and maximal benefits; this can be accomplished with the use of wireless technology attached to the PAP devices. This store-forward management approach potentially allows better care to Veterans with sleep apnea. Veterans have a high prevalence of sleep apnea, a breathing disorder during sleep that is treated by using a positive airway pressure (PAP) device nightly. The PAP units provided to Veterans for use at home contain sensors that record on a data chip when the treatment is used and how well it is working to correct the breathing disorder. Currently, VA sleep centers are obtaining this information by retrieving the data chips from the PAP units. However, the use of these data chips is inefficient, increases patient burden (often resulting in long patient travel time), and increases cost of care. It requires having the patients bring the data chips to clinic appointments or mailing of the data chips. Recent advances permit a wireless modem attached to the PAP unit to transmit this important clinical information securely to the manufacturer's server where it is stored. The patient's provider can log on to the manufacturer's password protected website to review the data and use this objective information to guide clinical management. In addition to providing information about patient adherence to determine the treatment efficacy, the wireless system allows the provider to evaluate the functionality of the equipment and determine if the equipment is malfunctioning. If the provider needs to change the PAP setting, this order can be transmitted to the PAP unit remotely through a call from the manufacturer's server to the wireless modem. Patient security is maintained by assigning the patient a code number as the identifier on the manufacturer's software. No identifiable personal information crosses the VA firewall. Using the wireless system instead of the data chip technology will reduce the number of patient clinic visits and facilitate timely collection of the information. 
B.	GENERAL
The wireless modems are devices that attaches to a PAP unit which both the modem and PAP unit were designed to work in conjunction with one another.  At this writing, the two PAP manufactures whose PAP units are utilized by the Atlanta VA are Res Med and Phillips Respironics and both have the capability of the wireless modems.  Res Med's software is called Easy Care and Phillips Respironics' software is called Encore Anywhere.  If other PAP manufacture(s) units are obtained by the Atlanta VA with the wireless modem capability, then the requirements in this SOW will apply or another statement of work will be developed.
C.	DATA IDENTIFICATION
Every attempt to protect the demographic and clinical information of the veteran/patient will be made by following the requirements of HIPPA and VA standards.  Patient identification of the data being transmitted will be a random code number(s) and/or character(s) throughout the process.  A VA staff clinician will assign the random code number to each modem and each code number will be entered into the patient log file on the sleep providers' shared folder.  In reviewing the data the clinician or health care provider will identify the data by the random code number and make the necessary updates in CPRS.  At no time will any of the patient's identification be put onto the data or report while the data is in electronic form while outside the VA firewalls; the patient's identifiers will be added once the data or reports is within the secured VA network (VISTA, CPRS, etc.).  
D.	DATA RETREIVAL
To have access to the data, the Atlanta VA staff member will go onto the PAP vendor's website and then to their software application.  A user name and password (which will change periodically) is required to gain access to the data.  Once the data is accessible, the clinician will locate the patient's data by the random code number.  The data will be in raw form or reports depending on the decision of the reviewing clinician.  This data will have the capability to be printed to a VA network printer.  (Note: The patient's demographic information or identification can only be added onto the data after the data is accessible within the secured VA network.)

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

A. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be
subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks
as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

If applicable, the contractor will enter into and agree to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) upon award of the contract or a national BAA is in place.


B. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA
information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only
to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task
order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with
VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees
or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of
background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive
and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations,
Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid
security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive
Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the
classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids,
or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a
Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security
Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and
National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S.
to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and
are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state
where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable
by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control,
data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when
an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves
the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified
immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

A.	 VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance
or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in
performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall
not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause
expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the
contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure
VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling
must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure
that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization
requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and
subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties,
and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive
requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not
destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of
performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and
applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and
policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies
become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the
contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after
execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the
information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as
authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic
information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case
any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to
an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is
complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold
payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for
cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated
and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business
Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information,
there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information
in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2
validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable,
shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available
upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for
performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA
records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records
and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug
addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human
immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other
requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA
sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the
contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on
a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

B.	INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

a. Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA
facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA,
NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information
systems. This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R.
Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in
accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls
commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA

d. Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context
without elevated system administration privileges.

e. The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented
in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in
NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA
Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle.

f. The contractor/subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of
Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy
Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and
applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of
criminal and civil penalties.
g. The contractor/subcontractor agrees to:

(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations
issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on
individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies:

(a) The Systems of Records (SOR); and

(b) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/subcontractor is to
perform;

(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and
resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work
statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a
SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and

 (3) Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts
awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a
SOR.

h. In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency
involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on
individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the
officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on
individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for
the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the
contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.

(1) "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities
associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and
dissemination of records.

(2) "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that
is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions,
medical
history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying
number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a
fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.

(3) "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency
from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number,
symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.
i. The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and
technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout
the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes,
but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components
(hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security
vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating
Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact
the Systems.

j. The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful
exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the
confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such
issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than ____ days.

k. When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS
patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has
been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is
responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes
within ____ days.

l. All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely
manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this
paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the
contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

C.	INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE

a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA
at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for
ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and
privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments,
routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the
completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security
control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA
Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network
involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in
place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the
information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be
assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or
inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior
to the collection of PII.

c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or
network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires
certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance
with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification
Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment)
contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums
of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types
are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems
connected to VA networks.

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST
standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update
the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA
contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The
contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial
actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices,
and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the
timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to
periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector
General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities
must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may
affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be
reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing
and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The
Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self-assessment on all systems
and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment
must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an
assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The
contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the
contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no
additional cost.

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor owned
equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to
fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or
contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must
be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the
equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV)
software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and
patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral
software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment
that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA
Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the
contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any
person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard
drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that
contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the
contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1
requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives,
optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end
of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in
place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement
cost at time of purchase.

 (4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software
associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard
drive, then;

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has
sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned
physically intact; and

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the
drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

D.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in
unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action
that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify
the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any
known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has
access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is
deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have
known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify
the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the
executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor
must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of
jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its
employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law
enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible
criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall
cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other
compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive
relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

E.	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to
sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in
the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor
processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set
forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must
secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk
analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for
the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The
term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other
than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal
information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the
confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity
performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and
grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach,
including the following:

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

(2) Description of the event, including:

(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;

(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);

 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;

(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and

(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be
responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals
consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;

(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

(3) Data breach analysis;

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit
records, histories, or financial affairs.

F.	SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to
evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor
under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request
of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored
security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored,
or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA,
including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a
security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as
determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. The contractor's Past Performance will be reviewed. Companies that have negative past performance shall not be awarded the contract. The price will be determined fair and reasonable IAW Far Part 13.106 <BR> <BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers
Question 1:	The description in the quote says-  "Process controller logic programming for boilers 1, 2, and 3, and calibration of boiler 3 instrumentation in accordance with the attached Statement of Work."  I would read this that only number 3 controls get calibrated and some logic gets changed around in all three boilers. The spec seems to indicate all boilers and plant instrumentation will be calibrated and documented. All safeties will be checked and documented. All boilers will be tuned from the bottom up on both fuels.
Which one do they want because they don't read the same?
Answer:	You are correct that only #3 boiler is to be tuned and calibrated. You are also correct in the assumption that the control logic is the only changes to the other two boilers. When you read the details, the tuning and calibration is specific to #3 boiler not to the other boilers.
	
Question 2:	What controls are currently in place?
Answer:	The current system utilizes Moore 353 controllers.  At present, there are no plans to upgrade.
	
Question 3:	On the pressure switches the spec does not clarify if we are just tripping the device or if the switch is to be calibrated and set.
Answer:	The pressure devices are only to be tripped rather than calibrated and set.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>The Great Plains Region is seeking proposals for a working model of a hydropower dam. The model will be approximately 24# W X 40# LX  36# T, although dimensions can vary. The model will include a cut-away of a typical dam, using clear material such as plexiglass,to  demonstrate functioning of penstocks, gates, and hydro-generation.  The model will have a working generator housed in a model power  station, also with a cutaway to view the generator functioning. The generator will produce or simulate production of enough electri city to power three devices, switching between items such as an LED light, a small fan, and a buzzer/or preferably a Tesla-coil type  device (dependent on design capabilities).  The model will run via electric cord and battery pack. The model will include an uncont rolled spillway with an irrigation gate beneath to release water into a channel which will run into a river at the front base of the  model. The model will include a pump which will refill the dam reservoir w/ water released through the penstock, gates or uncontrol led spillway. The model does will represent typical functions of both a hydroelectric dam, and a dam used for irrigation. The model will have materials simulating concrete and other natural materials surrounding the cut-away areas. The model will come with a shipp ing/transport case, complete with wheels, able to be transported and set up by a single person.  It is acceptable to need two people  to load and unload the model/case from a vehicle.  The case must be suitable for transport through typical shipping companies, such  as UPS, FEDEX, etc.

<DESC>Please note, this amendment revises the fourth question related to communication program evaluation methods.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The applicable NAICS code is 519130 with a size standard of 500 employees.
<p><br />The National Prevention Information Network (NPIN), at its inception as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National AIDS Clearinghouse, was designed to facilitate the sharing of information and resources among people working in HIV prevention, treatment, and support services. Today, NPIN remains a comprehensive web-based source of science-based information and resources, which is targeted to professionals dedicated to the prevention of HIV, viral hepatitis, STDs, and TB, although some of NPIN products and services are accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>NPIN has the following objectives:</p>
<p>o To support CDC and National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) efforts to provide timely information and resources to prevention partners through innovative approaches to knowledge/information transfer. <br />o To connect partners in public health through collaborative communication, innovative technology solutions, and personalized customer service. <br />o To provide a strong Internet presence, online databases, and technical assistance via on-line support. <br />o To support and apply innovation in communication theory and practice to enhancing communication and engagement with prevention partners and stakeholders in order to maximize health impact.</p>
<p>The original mission of these information services was cast in the broadest terms by the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic and by the Omnibus Legislation of 1988. Early efforts were clearly "demand-driven" as NPIN and its predecessor, the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse, struggled to be responsive to all legitimate information needs and the resulting pressures of increasing demand. The dramatic changes taking place in the dissemination of information and the increased number of sources of information have fostered a spirit of change and a need to refine the services and products of NPIN, to tailor them to current and emerging user needs, and to take advantage of evolving technology - primarily web-based delivery systems. In addition, the level of sophistication of NPIN audiences is heightened, and their information/knowledge needs require more depth and breadth in content areas.</p>
<p>The services and products provided by NPIN are the primary mechanism for NCHHSTP to support prevention partners, stakeholders, and other constituents.</p>
<p>Please answer the questions below to demonstrate capability:</p>
<p>1. Does your firm have the capacity to maintain and develop telecommunication networks to include: IT communication channel management, database development, and web content analysis?</p>
<p>2. Does your firm have an understanding on maintaining, developing, and cataloging relevant public health education materials and products? Please explain how those materials/products would be distributed using communication technology such as special data products, RESTFUL APIs, RSS feeds and/or other data feeds.</p>
<p>3. What key strategies does your firm use to increase awareness regarding public health programs using health communication channels, social marketing, social media and outreach targeted towards specific public health issues? How does your firm engage/cultivate stakeholder, policy makers, and other influential partners using multimedia and other communication channels?</p>
<p>4. Describe your firm's capability in conducting communication program evaluation methods to include: digital media channel monitoring and metrics reporting, communication technology services tracking, providing training and technical assistance in communication and partnerships, and conducting and evaluating communication and education program enhancements.<br /><br />5. How does your firm remain relevant in the world of communication technology? Please describe your firm's process in staying abreast of new technologies, best in-class industry practices and forwarding thinking technology solutions.<br /><br />Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements shall include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>

<CONTACT>GEORGE SIEVERS

<a href="mailto:george_sievers@nps.gov">tonya_bradley@nps.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer the following questions: 1.	Can you tell me more about the small business classification listed as $7m?   Is this a one year revenue figure or is this a three year average? Response:  Please reference the following link:  http://www.sba.gov/content/guide-size-standards 2.	Is there an incumbent contractor for these efforts?  If yes, please provide the contract details.  I'm looking for the contractor name, contract #, period of performance, and value.
Response: Incumbent contractors are as follows:
Name: Susan Richards Johnson Contract No.: C600090101/P09PC60834 Period of Performance: 09/15/2009 - 09/14/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: Anderson Hallas Architects Contract No.: C6000090102/P09PC60833 Period of Performance:  09/15/2009 - 09/14/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: Quinn Evans Architects, Inc. Contract No.: C6000090201/P09PC60837 Period of Performance: 09/09/2009 - 09/08/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: BVH	 Contract No.: C6000090202/P09PC60851 Period of Performance: 09/14/2009 - 09/13/2014 Value: $2,500,000
3.	 The two notices, P14PS00241 and P14PS00245 are classified as "presolicitation" - yet the submittal requires a Letter of Interest, an SF 330, and an Organization Chart. Are these notices actually solicitations, and not presolicitations?  i.e. will selections and awards be made from the submittals in response to these notices? Or is there to be a solicitation to follow?  If so, what is the purpose of these submittals?
Response: This is the process for this type of requirement.  Selections will be made from responses to this announcement to move on to the next phase of this requirement.
4.	 The solicitation lists "required disciplines" and "secondary support disciplines".  Are you expecting the secondary support disciplines to be represented in our submission (in addition to the required disciplines)?  I just want to make sure we are putting together the proper team.
Response:  Yes, the panel will need to have the entire team of subs documented in the SF330 in order to evaluate the submittal.
5.	 The set aside for this solicitation says "Total Small Business"...does this mean that our entire team must consist of firms that meet the SBA criteria for small businesses, or does only the Prime contractor have to meet the criteria? Response:  The Prime contractor must be a small business 6.	I had a question about professional registration for engineers on the team. Do our engineers already need to be registered in all of the states in the Midwest region, or is that something that can be done after we are selected, or on a project basis? Response: The prime contractor and subconsultants must be able to obtain registration in any of the thirteen states as project require.  State registrations do not need to be obtained initially, but the anticipated cost of registration should be included in your overhead price pool. 7.	 I'd like to confirm that the prime for this solicitation can be a landscape architecture firm (541320). It notes this code as being acceptable on page 3 but does not mention this code on page 1. Response:  Yes. A landscape architecture firm can be the prime on this contract. 8.	 As a certified EDWOSB, we would like to be considered for BOTH solicitations, one for the women-owned set-aside and one for the small-business set-aside. Will the NPS review submissions from the same team for each one of the solicitations? Please comment. Response:  To be considered for both solicitations, one must submit a package to each announcement. 9.	  Under evaluation criteria, the solicitation states that: The following criteria in descending order of importance shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms: 1. Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for satisfactory performance of desired services. Will the prime be evaluated separately from the subconsultant team? Will the reviewing committee take into account the entire teams' qualifications, specialized experience, past experience, past performance? Or does the PRIME need to have DEMONSTRATED experience in all the primary disciplines. Sometimes the solicitation refers to the A/E firm and sometimes it refers to the team. Please clarify.

<a href="mailto:george_sievers@nps.gov">tonya_bradley@nps.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer the following questions: 1.	Can you tell me more about the small business classification listed as $7m?   Is this a one year revenue figure or is this a three year average? Response:  Please reference the following link:  http://www.sba.gov/content/guide-size-standards 2.	Is there an incumbent contractor for these efforts?  If yes, please provide the contract details.  I'm looking for the contractor name, contract #, period of performance, and value.
Response: Incumbent contractors are as follows:
Name: Susan Richards Johnson Contract No.: C600090101/P09PC60834 Period of Performance: 09/15/2009 - 09/14/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: Anderson Hallas Architects Contract No.: C6000090102/P09PC60833 Period of Performance:  09/15/2009 - 09/14/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: Quinn Evans Architects, Inc. Contract No.: C6000090201/P09PC60837 Period of Performance: 09/09/2009 - 09/08/2014 Value: $2,500,000
Name: BVH	 Contract No.: C6000090202/P09PC60851 Period of Performance: 09/14/2009 - 09/13/2014 Value: $2,500,000
3.	 The two notices, P14PS00241 and P14PS00245 are classified as "presolicitation" - yet the submittal requires a Letter of Interest, an SF 330, and an Organization Chart. Are these notices actually solicitations, and not presolicitations?  i.e. will selections and awards be made from the submittals in response to these notices? Or is there to be a solicitation to follow?  If so, what is the purpose of these submittals?
Response: This is the process for this type of requirement.  Selections will be made from responses to this announcement to move on to the next phase of this requirement.
4.	 The solicitation lists "required disciplines" and "secondary support disciplines".  Are you expecting the secondary support disciplines to be represented in our submission (in addition to the required disciplines)?  I just want to make sure we are putting together the proper team.
Response:  Yes, the panel will need to have the entire team of subs documented in the SF330 in order to evaluate the submittal.
5.	 The set aside for this solicitation says "Total Small Business"...does this mean that our entire team must consist of firms that meet the SBA criteria for small businesses, or does only the Prime contractor have to meet the criteria? Response:  The Prime contractor must be a small business 6.	I had a question about professional registration for engineers on the team. Do our engineers already need to be registered in all of the states in the Midwest region, or is that something that can be done after we are selected, or on a project basis? Response: The prime contractor and subconsultants must be able to obtain registration in any of the thirteen states as project require.  State registrations do not need to be obtained initially, but the anticipated cost of registration should be included in your overhead price pool. 7.	 I'd like to confirm that the prime for this solicitation can be a landscape architecture firm (541320). It notes this code as being acceptable on page 3 but does not mention this code on page 1. Response:  Yes. A landscape architecture firm can be the prime on this contract. 8.	 As a certified EDWOSB, we would like to be considered for BOTH solicitations, one for the women-owned set-aside and one for the small-business set-aside. Will the NPS review submissions from the same team for each one of the solicitations? Please comment. Response:  To be considered for both solicitations, one must submit a package to each announcement. 9.	  Under evaluation criteria, the solicitation states that: The following criteria in descending order of importance shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms: 1. Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for satisfactory performance of desired services. Will the prime be evaluated separately from the subconsultant team? Will the reviewing committee take into account the entire teams' qualifications, specialized experience, past experience, past performance? Or does the PRIME need to have DEMONSTRATED experience in all the primary disciplines. Sometimes the solicitation refers to the A/E firm and sometimes it refers to the team. Please clarify. Response:   Prime and subs should demonstrate experience in historic preservation projects for their specific expertise. The team will be evaluated as a whole, making sure that all both primary and secondary disciplines are covered in some way. 10.	 What entities and individuals will be involved in the evaluation process? Response:  A team of NPS historical architects, landscape architects, and historical landscape architects with experience in project management at the regional office and park level. 11.	  The Scope of Work includes "survey". Does this refer to topographic survey? Please clarify and define the term survey. Response: Topographic and site survey 12.	  Secondary support disciplines list "surveying and dense cloud point mapping" Does surveying refer to topographic surveying? Please clarify and define the term surveying.
Response: Yes, see #11
13.	 Under the Header "Set Aside"- it says Total Small Business. Do all subconsultants have to meet the NAICS small business cap for the NAICS codes and/or primary/secondary disciplines?
Response: No.  Only the prime contractor has to meet the small business cap for the NAICS code.
14.	 "In addition, the A/E firm shall a. Demonstrate expertise in preparing required compliance documents associated w/ NEPA, such as EIS and IA, especially past performance with NEPA compliance on cultural resource projects".  Is the NPS requiring that the prime have this demonstrated experience or can a subconsultant offer NEPA/EA demonstrated experience. Response: NEPA experience at the subconsultant level is fine. 15.

<DESC>The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price production contract, via Full and Open competition, in the 2QFY14 timeframe for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. This notice is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for the potential future competition.
<p>1. The closing date for the RFI is 4:30PM EST, 05 April 2013.<br />2. Unclassified information available upon request includes: DRAFT FMU-139D/B Performance Spec PMA201-12-001.<br />3. Industry Day is scheduled for 20-21 March 2013 in Lexington Park, MD. Please contact Ms. Darla M Kelly, darla.kelly@navy.mil, for attendance information. Industry Day will be held in order to provide an opportunity for discussion in order to assist potential Offerors in preparation of their RFI.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request For Information (RFI). NAVAIR, PEO (U&amp;W), and PMA-201 is seeking information from industry regarding the evolutionary improvement to the FMU-139 performance characteristics via the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Spec PMA201-12-001. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.</p>
<p>General Description: The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139C/B is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to identify potential cost and/or schedule drivers that would impact a potential source from being able to build to the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, or any other improvements that could be incorporated with minimal cost/schedule impact. The Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources which detail the below areas of interest. Responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how concepts were developed and methodologies used that could satisfy stated requirements, including a top level description of the proposed upgrade concept, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, verification and validation of capability concepts, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, future technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any newly proposed concept including key subsystems and methodology used to determine TRL, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for any newly proposed concept and methodology used to determine MRL. Key areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Comments to DRAFT Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, including the identification of any requirements that are significant cost drivers. Provide specific cost/schedule impact with recommendations.<br />&bull; Hardened target capability to 10,000 PSI. Identify the specific cost increase, schedule impacts, and changes required to current/future production lines and manufacturing processes needed to include this requirement. <br />&bull; Multi-layer target penetration capabilities, equating to up to four (4) six (6) inch layers of 5,000-psi concrete or equivalent, commensurate to a standard multi-story facility construction.<br />&bull; FZU-48 performance in high altitude/low airspeed (HALA) environments, specifically associated with the MQ-9 platform. Identification of potential turbine generator replacement systems to address HALA requirements, as well as cost/schedule impacts .<br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems that could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons. Additionally how alternatives would be incorporated into current manufacturing and production lines, and the cost/schedule impact of incorporating these alternatives.</p>
<p>Responses: Responders are responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI; the Government will not provide any form of compensation or reimbursement for the information provided. The Government may request additional information upon review. Responses to this RFI should not to exceed 25 pages in length on 8.5 x 11 paper with one inch margins and font no smaller than 10 pt Times New Roman or Courier New.

<p>General Description: The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139C/B is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to identify potential cost and/or schedule drivers that would impact a potential source from being able to build to the draft FMU-139D/B Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, or any other improvements that could be incorporated with minimal cost/schedule impact. The Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources which detail the below areas of interest. Responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how concepts were developed and methodologies used that could satisfy stated requirements, including a top level description of the proposed upgrade concept, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, verification and validation of capability concepts, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, future technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any newly proposed concept including key subsystems and methodology used to determine TRL, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for any newly proposed concept and methodology used to determine MRL. Key areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Comments to DRAFT Performance Specification PMA201-12-001, including the identification of any requirements that are significant cost drivers. Provide specific cost/schedule impact with recommendations.<br />&bull; Hardened target capability to 10,000 PSI.

Roth Well Field on River Road. The purpose of the project is to stabilize the shoreline, and prevent further erosion of the riverbank. The project will be constructed under the special continuing authority contained in Section 14 of the 1946 Flood Control Act (as amended). This project will be constructed in partnership with a local, non-Federal sponsor (the City of Middletown), and when completed will be turned over to the sponsor.   <br>    <br>  The construction project will consist of a stone toe along the bank below the water surface which will be buried, and then a layer stone revetment leading up the slope at which point the revetment will become recessed and covered with a layer of topsoil. The stone revetment will be placed only along selected locations of the bank, leaving approximately 30% of the existing floodplain forest intact. Stone protection that will be placed along the bank immediately adjacent to the well field will rest at an approximate 1:2 Vertical to Horizontal slope, which will become embedded, and covered with topsoil. The topsoil will then be planted with native vegetation which will extend to the crest of the slope. The upper crest of the slope will then be planted with native trees. In addition, a series of bendway weirs are planned to be placed at the base of the lower bank within the intertidal area adjacent to the flow of the river.   <br>    <br>  This will not be a continuing contract. This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents, including instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about January 31, 2014. Telephonic, mailed, and faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will not be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online. In order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to Jessica.M.Kidd@usace.army.mil  <br>
