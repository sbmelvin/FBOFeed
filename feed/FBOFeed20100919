<DESC><br />***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Resonon in Bozeman, MT for the purchase of companion spatial engines to existing spectral engines.***
<p>*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>*** Previously NIST contracted with Resonon to build two spectral engines as part of a Hyperspectral Image System. NIST currently has a need for spatial engines that will be compatible with the existing spectral engines manufactured by Resonon. The sole source determination is based on Resonon, Inc. being the only manufacturer capable of successful designing and manufacturing the spatial engine that will be 100% compatible with existing spectral engines which were designed and manufactured by Resonon. No other vendor can meet the NIST requirement for the design and manufacturing of a spatial engine that will be compatible with existing spectral engines without a significant duplication in cost. Resonon is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system.<br /><br />***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 180 days after receipt of order.***</p>
<p>***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500 employees.***</p>
<p>***No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 3, 2010.***</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

DESCRIPTION:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14. This synopsis is a streamlined solicitation of offers for commercial items for use where appropriate. This is intended to simplify the process of preparing and issuing solicitations/synopsis for evaluating offers for commercial items consistent with commercial practices. Only written requests, electronically submitted, and received directly from the requester are acceptable. This requirement is 100% set aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code is 423450, with a size standard of 100 employees.

The current system is based on the OpenEye Xr-Series. The attached equipment list is to add/replace some of the existing equipment (this is not a replacement of the whole system, rather an enhancement). Offerors shall submit a detailed (itemized) quote to include: all equipment, equipment manufacturer part numbers, materials, installation, and configuration services for the system as listed only. The offeror shall comply with specifications listed below. HD NVR equipment by AVIGILON is requested but not necessary if alternate submittal is substantially better.

  NIST Response: The expectation is to have the capability for a small number of people, working virtually, to access a content database to download or upload content, to retrieve files of content, whether graphic or text, and to create new content for training courses, presentations, and the like.  There would be some kind of author control function, like exists on a wiki or a blog.  There would be the capability to temporarily assign passwords to people outside of our organization to access and help create content.  For example, if our national program wanted to work with one of the state level programs to jointly create a synchronous or asynchronous learning event.
 
2.Question: Page 3 Item B. 7  Ability to launch web-based, synchronous collaboration tools directly from user interface 
             Can you please provide examples of the web-based synchronous collaboration tools you wish to launch?  

 NIST Response:  Examples today are Webex, Interwise, AdobeConnect.

3. Question: Page 3 Item B.8  Multiple portals
     How many portals does BNQP anticipate each year?  

  NIST response: No more than three. 
 
4. Question: Page 3 Item B.12  Built-in social networking capability
     What type of Built in Social Networking capability is desired?  

  NIST Response: The capability to schedule and track social networking activity, especially if such activity has been assigned as a learning event.
 
5.   Question: Page 3 Item B.14   Individual Development Plans based on job title
       How many different job titles exist at present? 

  NIST Response: Currently there are four job titles for our examiners.  NIST may have a need to add one or two in the next two years.
 
6. Question: Page 3 Item B. 15   Ability to recommend training activities to lower skills gaps
 
Does a curriculum exist for each job title?  Does BNQP expect to include training from outside  
 sources such as universities and other vendors to fill in the skill gaps?  

 NIST Response:  NIST envision that a curriculum would indeed exist for each job title.  It is possible that, as we expand our partnerships, that we would include training offered by universities, Baldrige based state quality programs, and very possibly from our own internal resources within NIST.
 
7. Question: Page 3 Item B. 17  System to define and store personal competencies and related training
Do the competencies exist at present or do they need to be created?  Will the government provide the competencies upon award?  

NIST Responses: The competencies do exist, although they are in the process of being refined.  However, we probably would want to start with the basic LMS functions before switching on this functionality.
 
8. Question: Page 5 Part 4. Training and Support
You reference the usage of user guides for administrators within BNQP.  Can you please provide clarification of the role of BNQP employees as administrators of the LMS?  Is this a shared responsibility with the contractor?  What are your expectations for the BNQP administrator(s)? 

 NIST Response: Is a shared responsibility with the contractor, and as such, defining specific roles for BNQP and the contractor around administration would be part of standing up the LMS.

9 Question: Page 6 Performance Standard #2.
Please define top box.

*NIST Response: Top box is a generic term that refers to the highest rating for a particular rating scale.  For example, if you have a rating scale of 1 to 5, 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 5 being extremely satisfied, then the top box would be the % of 5 responses.
 
 
10. Question: Are there any incumbents currently performing these services, or is this a brand new effort?

 NIST Response: This is a new effort for the Baldrige Program. 

11. Question: Page 5, Section E: Period of Performance and Place of Performance
      Is there a mileage limitation on the Contractors facility from the Government facility?

      NIST Response:  No 
  
12. Question: Page 7, Section I: Contractors Minimum Qualification

Per the RFP, the Contractors must have at least 5 years of experience in providing LMS Management services.  Does Contractor include all Subcontractor experience?

NIST Response: The contractor and subcontractor must have at least five year of experience

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>QUESTIONS and RESPONSES:

1ST SET OF QUESTIONS:
1.  Is there an incumbent guard force at the school now or is this a new requirement?
2.  If there is a current force, how many guards are there ?  Do they meet all the requirements of the new contract ? If not, what are they lacking ?
RESPONSE:   There is an incumbent contractor;  this office did not award the contact.  To obtain information, contact Ms. Carlita Key, phone number 951/ 276-6325, Ext. 210.


2ND SET OF QUESTIONS:
1- Is the pay wage for the guards $13.15 for the guards and $15.95 for the supervisor?
RESPONSE:  Please reference Section J, Service Contract Act (SCA) Wage Determination for all minimum pay levels.
2- Is it recommended to send over information about our selection and placement of our guards? Or do you only suggest I send the 1449 and the Quote Schedule?
RESPONSE:  To be considered for award, you must submit at minimum, the SF 1449 and the Quote Schedule.
Please note that FAR Clause 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, (g) Contract Award reads:  "Contract Award.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussion if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary."
Based on FAR 52.212-01 (g),  -  if you feel that you need to "clarify" your quote, services, personnel, etc., it is recommended that you provide a technical proposal and any other information THAT WILL PRESENT YOUR "BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNIAL STANDPOINT".

3- Will there be at least 24 hours notice for special event patrol?
RESPONSE:  The contractor will be provided with the school calendar which identifies all special events, which enable the contractor to schedule the guards as required under Statement of Work Item C-2 Personnel, 2 b, which reads:  ". . .  the Contractor shall schedule the security guard's tour of duty and shall be responsible for security coverage through the campus, . . ." .


3RD SET OF QUESTIONS:
1.  Regarding SOW Section C-2.3 Training:  Is the 40 hours of training that is to be completed prior to assigning a guard to the campus in addition to the 40 hours required by the State of California or is this the same?
RESPONSE:  Please review the Statement of Work, Item 3 Training which requires "the training to "have been completed prior to assigning a guard to the campus."

2.  In the "Quote Prices" sheets, regarding Line Item 4. Special Events: SOW section C-10.4.A Ten Additional Events has all hour but the homecoming dance which is TBA. As Line Item 4. appears to be required to be totaled in Line Item 5 on the Quote Prices sheets, do you have estimated hours for the dance or what direction can the government provide?

RESPONSE:  See Statement of Work, Item C-10, 4 A.  Most of the special event items state a time of 6:00 PM to 12:00 midnight.  Apply that time to the homecoming dance.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division.

2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of E-Smart Stainless Steel Custom "C" Height Adjustable ergonomic SPD Prep Assembly workstations from Capsa Solutions. 

      Capsa Solutions
12230 N.E. Woodinville Drive, 
Suite A 
Woodinville, WA 98072
1-425-398-1875

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Two E-Smart Stainless Steel Custom "C" Height Adjustable ergonomic SPD Prep Assembly  workstations 36" wide and one E-Smart Stainless Steel Custom "C" Height Adjustable ergonomic SPD Prep Assembly  workstation 36" wide and 72" long. All three of these include manual handcrank, overhead light, power strip, one wire grid, two peg boards, three half shelves, bin and spool holder, cpu housing, stainless steel drawer and monitor arm. This supports the daily function of RME assembly, processing and sterile wrapping in the SPD daily for all hospital departments in the VA to provide sterile and high level decontamination for the patients at Seattle VA.  Required deliver date is 30 Sept 2010 and needs to be completed ASAP.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW 6.302-1 and 41 USC 253(c), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. Capsa Solutions is the only company found to offer tables with manual height adjustment.

6.	Actions to Promote Competition: In the future, the contracting specialist will conduct market research for any new vendors that offer these tables. 

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $16,608.00.  Capsa Solutions is offering the VA a 20% discount from their standard list price. Based on this, the contract specialist determined the price to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  An internet search was conducted as well as OneSource, GSA and Medical Supply websites.  IAHCSMM was contacted for some help and they did have information on one vendor that could meet our need.  In using like searches we were unable to find another company other than the one submitted that could provide height adjustable SPD prep stations that would allow for each user to set their height during their shift. Other companies can adjust their height for installation only.  

9.	Other Considerations:  Capsa Solutions is a small business. A recent IG inspection confirmed that the VA staffs were working under inappropriate work conditions in relation to employee strain, potential for injury, and system flow.

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market by submitting a sources sought notice through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors are authorized to service these items.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
