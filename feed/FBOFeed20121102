However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<p>The types of reviews include: First time review, cases requiring additional information, re-review for new clinical evidence, re-review for new question(s), other assigned work, and panel review for any of the aforementioned noted types of review and consultation services and special projects.</p>
<p>Coding specialists must have nationally accepted credentials/certifications. The medical physician staff must have a degree in doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathic medicine, doctor of dental surgery, or doctor of dental medicine from an accredited university.

<CONTACT>DANIEL L HERRING, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 717-770-6030, Fax 717-770-5689, Email daniel.herring@dla.mil
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Repair and Upgrade a White Systems Vertical Carousel Model 2400 located at DLA Distribution Albany GA.
<p>White Systems/SencorpWhite is the only source that can Repair and Upgrade the Model 2400 Vertical Carousel because, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), they possess the necessary drawings and/or technical manuals needed to disassemble the unit; replace the lower panels, counter, and doors (including brackets and tracks); reassemble the unit; test all methods of operation to certify the carousel for safe operation; and upgrade the PCB microprocessor and microprocessor keyboard controller to replace obsolete components. As the OEM, White Systems/SencorpWhite has access to factory-authorized replacement parts needed to ensure that the carousel is performing in accordance with the applicable manufacturer specifications. In order to ensure that the performance, reliability and safety of this White Systems Vertical Carousel is not compromised, the contractor that performs the Repair and Upgrade must employ factory trained service technicians who are technically familiar with the White Systems Vertical Carousel, and have unlimited access to obtain OEM replacement parts. The use of non-OEM replacement parts and non-OEM factory trained service technicians could be detrimental to the Government in terms of damage to the equipment. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order utilizing FAR Part 13 to White Systems/SencorpWhite to Repair and Upgrade the Model 2400 Vertical Carousel.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811310 with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.00.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to Repair and Upgrade a White Systems Vertical Carousel Model 2400 by 4:00 PM Eastern time, FRIDAY NOVEMBER 16, 2012 to DLA Distribution, Acquisition Operations, J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Attn: Daniel Herring, Phone: 717-770-6030, FAX: 717-770-5689, e-mail: daniel.herring@dla.mil, for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM Eastern time, FRIDAY NOVEMBER 16, 2012 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated with and awarded to White Systems/SencorpWhite.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. NASA/JSC has a requirement for the continued support to the Bioastronautics Contract in the Human Health and Performance Directorate. The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of NASAs intent to increase the not-to-exceed value to the Bioastronautics Contract, NAS 9-02078.  The Bioastronautics Contract provides medical services, human adaptation & environmental factors research, technology development, engineering, operations support, science & mission integration, flight hardware development and other related products and services supporting the Space Life Sciences Directorate at the Johnson Space Center. Wyle Laboratories, Inc. is the incumbent contractor for the Bioastronautics Contract providing critical support since contract start on May 1, 2003, giving them a unique knowledge and understanding of the full spectrum of Life Sciences activities to sustain healthy human life in the harsh environment of space.  Wyle possesses critical skills necessary to continue operational support of the International Space Station (ISS) Program.  Additionally support to the Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle Program (MPCV).  The increase to the not-to-exceed value to the existing Bioastronautics Contract  will ensure cross utilization of resources across all programs and will provide seamless operations support to the ISS and MPCV Programs.  The ISS support provided by Wyle under the Bioastronautics Contract is critical due to the nature of on-orbit anomaly resolution that requires real-time decisions associated with complex medical and technical solutions of an on orbit crew.  This action will not extend the current contract term.	The period of performance of the Bioastronautics Contract is from May 1, 2003 to April 30, 2013.     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on November 16, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	  .

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08 November 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Wafare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake intends to enter into negotiations for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on an other than full and open competition basis to Joint Technologies Engineering (JTE).  The Government requires JTE to modify the H-1 Helicopter Unique Planning Component (UPC) and Avionics/Weapons/Electronics (AWE) software for use in the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  JTE is currently developing the first H-1 UPC for the Cobra System Configuration Set (SCS) and the AWE software for SCS 4.0.  An additional requirement exists to take the AWE software that JTE is currently developing and migrate it to the H-1 UPC. As a result, the Government requires JTE to modify the current UPC and AWE baselines to obtain concurrent updates for multiple other AWE and UPC baselines in order to implement Fleet-user Functionality.  The IDIQ max quantity is four SCS's including Cobra 4.0. SCS 5, SCS 6, and SCS 7.0.  Delivery will be 18-24 months as specified in individual delivery orders.   The contract will have an ordering period of 4 years.  This requirement is limited to JTE because they are still in the process of developing the technical data to meet the requirements and functionality of the original baseline, the Cobra 3.0 UPC and SCS 4.0 AWE.  This data, while being developed, will be modified/updated in order to address the new requirements for Cobra 4.0, 5.0 AWE, 6.0 UPC and 7.0 UPC.  As a result, any anomalies found in the current baseline must be incorporated concurrently in the remaining SCSs quickly in order to maintain program schedules.   Place of Performance is expected to be Niceville, FL.  Any firm believing that they can provide the needed updates without substantial duplication of cost, and within the needed time frame may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 20 March 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.   Award of this contract is expected on or about 15 May 2008.  All requests must reference the solicitation number N68936-08-R-0020.  Please submit responses in writing to Gary Trimble by email at gary.trimble@navy.mil or by mail to:  Commander Code 210000D, NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.  For a copy of the solicitation, please contact Gary Trimble.  See numbered note 22 & 26.       NAICS Code = 541511 Place of Performance  =  Niceville, FL Set Aside  =  N/A

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a contract with Sundance Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Inc., 4790 Caughlin Pkwy #233, Reno, NV 89519-0907 for Field Programmable Gate Array Cards.  This will be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for a min/max of 60/800 units over a five-year period.
  
The contract will be issued as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with delivery terms of 60 days after contract award.  Delivery will be FOB destination to NSWC Crane with inspection and acceptance at destination within 30 days of receipt.   

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1)(a)(2)(iii) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is that these cards are built specifically for the requirements of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.  Sundance (DSP) is the manufacturer of the FPGA card and the existing designs, drawings, and software code are their proprietary information.
   Establishing alternative sources will result in unacceptable duplicative costs to validate the alternative FPGA card, including revalidate and possibly redesign the Next Generation Software Loader hardware and software to communicate and interface with the new unit.  The new card would have to go through environmental testing involving temperature and moisture in both operational and stored configurations.  Additionally, the new card would have to be retested for functionality on the aircraft, thus consuming valuable mission time for the aircraft and incurring considerable costs.     
The solicitation will be available for download on or about 04 December 2012 located at http://www.fbo.gov and at Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.
  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued.  Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation.

The appropriate NAICS for this contract is 541330. The small business size standard classification for this contract is $14,000,000. Award will be made to up to seven of the most highly qualified firms and one or more contracts will be reserved for a qualified small business. The determination of which firms are the most highly qualified will be based on a subjective assessment of the evaluation board on the firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria included in the synopsis. A firm, either large or small, must at least meet the evaluation criteria to be considered "most highly qualified." If no small businesses are determined to be "most highly qualified," then no award will be made to a small business. Additionally, nothing prevents more than one small business being awarded a contract in the event they are more qualified than other large businesses. The highest ranked large and small businesses will then be invited to discussions. The number of firms invited for discussions will be sufficient such that up to seven IDIQ contracts may be awarded. A small business may be chosen over a higher ranked large business in order to meet the intent of the small business reservation. A small business will not be invited to a discussion if it cannot be determined most highly qualified by the evaluation board.<br />The general intent of task orders will not be to set them aside for small business should a small business be awarded a contract, however, the Government may set task orders aside in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F). <br />Large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan upon submission of their cost proposal should they be chosen for contract award.

The joint venture must also be registered in www.SAM.gov at the time of SF 330 submission.

<DESC>The AF ISR Agency issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the acquisition of environmental and particle analysis services. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with separation, manipulation, analysis, and identification of particulate matter for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification.

Sample analysis requires the ability to: (a) process and analyze samples provided by the government; (b) process and analyze 9,000 particles per year from as many as 450 samples per year; (c) perform thermal ion mass spectrometry analysis on 9,000 particles per year; (d) perform nondestructive screening of up to 300 samples per year; (e) maintain all processing areas and microscope clean rooms in accordance with the current General Services Administration standards for clean room and workstation requirements; (f) maintain class 100 clean room techniques sufficient to ensure no cross-contamination between samples; and (g) describe and characterize sample particle isotopic compositions. Other requirements include: (a) in the event the Government elects to procure environmental and particle analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start; (b) offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique mission essential analysis equipment will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for environmental and particle analysis services shall not be used for activities other than this contract without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level. Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. No information related to this acquisition or resulting contract is releasable to foreign nationals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$14.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois. Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 15 calendar days from the date of publication. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB). Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above. The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received.

This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, or a solicitation, and is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> to be constructed in any way as a commitment by the Government. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is</span></strong> a request for information to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources plus obtain insight on the nature of the industry. Responses to this RFI will assist in the development and structure of the ESG acquisition strategy prior to issuing any RFP. The Government will <strong>not pay</strong> respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents are also advised that submitting a capability package implies express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals for Government purposes. The Government highly encourages all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice, or to otherwise pay for information that is submitted. If the Government decides to contract for this effort, it will issue a RFP at a later date. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of publicizing this RFI notice is to aid in the development of the ESG KBS acquisition strategy, increase competition to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and gather information for planning purposes about the temporary employment market or capabilities as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The ESG is tasked with developing strategic sourcing solutions for the Air Force. The ESG KBS Commodity Council is investigating the availability of Temporary Service Firms, Advisory &amp; Assistance Service Firms, and cost saving opportunities.</p>
<p>Preliminary research suggests that the scope of any future contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, we seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing similar services. The input will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offers. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes/spend (3 year average annual receipts) suggest the potential classification code 561320, size standard $13.5M. Firms responding to this announcement shall indicate their business size for code 561320, particularly if they are a small business.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Provide cross-functional installation strategic sourcing and acquisition solutions that identify cost effective and time savings methods to acquire Knowledge Based Services - Temporary Staffing.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Knowledge Based Services (KBS), commonly referred to as Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), relates to tasks that require the application of detailed processes, technical knowledge, professional support, consultation, or staff assistance. The objective of the KBSCC is to develop a strategic process for temporary employment services that can provide required temporary staff for all eligible AF customers. Federal law establishes that an agency may use a temporary help service firm(s) in a single situation initially for no more than 120 workdays. Provided the situation continues to exist beyond the initial 120 workdays, the agency may extend its use of temporary help services up to the maximum limit of 240 workdays.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Capabilities Package:</strong> The ESG Knowledge Based Services Commodity Council is requesting your input to gather information to help us refine our requirements and to identify qualified parties who might be able to meet our future temporary employment requirements. Interested sources should complete the attached capability package, with information that demonstrates the companies experience to successfully provide the necessary temporary staffing services for the AF. This RFI allows the opportunity to provide input and recommendations consistent with your service offerings, industry trends, and cost saving suggestions. All parties with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth herein are invited to provide data on the capabilities of your company. The capabilities package should present clear evidence that the interested party is fully capable of meeting the requirements, and as such may contain any information the interested party feels is relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Capabilities Package Requirements:</strong> The Air Force has structured this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain industry feedback on the capabilities of the industry. Attachment 1 (Capability Package) was developed to obtain what we anticipate will be useful information as the KBS Commodity Council strategy is developed, while not requiring an undo level of effort from industry. The attached excel spreadsheet (Capability Package) is set up for your responses and any additional comments you may have. Please complete and return the spreadsheet to the email address below.</p>
<p>The Air Force will not accept or acknowledge: e-mails over 2MB, brochures, samples, catalogs and any other marketing solicitation information.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation basis:</strong> Responses will not be evaluated, but are for the purpose of gathering information to help refine our requirements and acquisition strategy, as wells as to identify qualified parties who might be able to meet our future requirements. Following submittal of this capability package, AF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents. Such communications would only be intended to support USAF market research by obtaining further clarification of industry capability to meet requirements.</p>
<p><strong>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR SOLICIATION MATERIAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> The spreadsheet (capability package) must be received in the contracting office not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 10 JAN 2013. Responses received after this date may be considered. <br /><br />Spreadsheet Capability Package or questions <strong>shall be submitted by email</strong> to the following mailbox:</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSYS
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for acquisition planning purposes only and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  Therefore, the information presented in this announcement does not obligate Reclamation in any manner.
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Regional Office, is in the acquisition planning stages of what may become a new acquisition for the benefit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Hopi Indian Tribe.
All qualified concerns interested in performing the proposed project may submit capability statements for consideration. Based upon response to this announcement and capability statements, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation or decide on an alternate procurement strategy. 
History of the Proposed Project Pasture Canyon Dam is located approximately 5 miles east of Tuba City AZ on the Hopi Indian Reservation.  Pasture Canyon Dam is an embankment dam, originally constructed circa 1936 for irrigation purposes.
The Proposed Project The intent of this project is the modification of the outlet works, spillway and embankment at Pasture Canyon Dam.
Modification of the outlet works will include excavation of the existing dam embankment, remove the existing outlet works and currently used siphon and replace it with a new outlet works structure. 
After removal of the existing outlet works the following will be constructed:     *   A reinforced concrete control house will be constructed on the crest of the dam     *   A reinforced concrete intake structure with trashrack and 2-foot by 2-foot slide gate     *   A reinforced concrete irrigation turnout structure     *   The new outlet works conduit will consists of a 26-inch high-density polyethylene (HDPE) carrier pipe in a 36-inch HDPE containment pipe encased-in-reinforced concrete.     *   A reinforced concrete irrigation turnout structure where flows bifurcate as regulated by 16-inch and 24-inch valve control systems     *   A reinforced concrete impact style stilling basin     *   All associated dewatering and earthwork reconstruction.
Modifications to the existing spillway include armoring the existing earth section with a reinforced concrete structure, 20-feet long in the direction of flow by 60-feet wide in the invert.  Riprap and bedding will be provided upstream and downstream of the concrete structure.
The embankment modification consists of a downstream sand filter blanket and toe drains.  The dam embankment reconstruction in the vicinity of the outlet works structure consisting of:     *   Approximately 21,000 cubic yards of embankment material     *   Required excavation (approximately 24,000 cubic yards) including excavation of some soft, unsuitable foundation soils     *   Installation of woven geotextile fabric for foundation treatment     *   Removal of 175 linear feet of a 5-foot tall vertical masonry wall on the upstream face      *   A sloped upstream face protected with riprap and bedding     *   A two-stage chimney filter will be constructed on the downstream face consisting of approximately 2,500 cubic yards of sand, and 1,600 cubic yards of gravel.     *   The 12-inch diameter HDPE toe drains are approximately 540 linear feet and surrounded by a sand and gravel zoned envelope     *   Weir boxes downstream of the embankment.     *   Crest and downstream slope protection consisting of gravel material.  
Maintaining irrigation delivery is required on this project and provisions, such as a cofferdam, are likely needed to store and later pass inflows.
All construction will need to be completed in a 6-9 month time frame during the off irrigation season.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in support of the Office of the Executive Director for Information Technology (EXIT) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could implement a property management and sample tracking system for multiple Commission needs. The primary goals of the Commission in this effort is to understand:<br />&bull; What market software is available for tracking the acquisition, receiving, tagging, and controlling of assets (whether property or samples)<br />&bull; What are the available approaches to inventory management across multiple locations with the least amount of human involvement, through technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID)<br />&bull; How to best manage the custodianship, borrows, transfers, and excess of assets<br />&bull; How a property management tool can be leveraged to forecast capital replacement costs, either through stand-along functionality, or in conjunction with a budget system</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, CPSC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Commission currently has two systems for tracking assets: Property Management and Sample Tracking. CPSC is interested in technologies that could replace or enhance both systems.</p>
<p>The Property Management System tracks CPSC property. The application provides asset control through bar code labels and readers, property documents, movement tracking, asset depreciation, record archiving, and reporting. Managed assets are located at CPSC headquarters, laboratory, warehouse, library, and regional offices.</p>
<p>The Sample Tracking System tracks a large volume of product samples either purchased or provided as part of an investigation. The samples are used for safety testing each year, and must not have their chain of custody broken. Therefore, the Commission Sample Custodian and other agency staff use this application to ensure sample handling continuity and integrity, and to record the final disposition of a sample. Every sample movement is recorded, and may be cited in court actions. There are a number of reports and search options available for managing samples.</p>
<p>All Commission staff and contractors, about 450 individuals in total, use the Property Management Application. Concurrently, there are no more than 5 users leveraging the system. The Sample Tracking Application is used by a smaller number of individuals, estimated at about 50, and no more than 5 concurrent users.</p>
<p>The applications currently operate on CPSC's network, with standard federal agency authority to operate, in an unclassified, business environment.</p>
<p>CPSC leverages .net applications in its environment, and is particularly interested in cloud-based or software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. The Commission is also interested in understanding what Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products could satisfy Commission needs.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>CPSC is requesting the following information through this RFI:</p>
<p>1. Explain the types of asset tracking systems (property and/or sample tracking) available and the pros/cons of each. <br />2. Explain how asset-tracking systems can enhance knowledge of capital assets and their respective values, and how they can establish a standard process for investment decision-making.<br />3. Explain abilities to automate asset entry into the asset tracking system. For example, can a system associate an asset and enter its data based on the scanning of a UPC, and associate it to a serial number.<br />4. Describe the ability of asset tracking systems to break out assets according to functional roles of government and enterprise funds (ex. public safety, administrative, etc.).<br />5. Explain how the asset tracking systems available could meet or exceed the functionality described for the Property Management System and Sample Tracking System in section 2.<br />6. Are there asset-tracking systems that do not require a connection to CPSC's network (ex. Cloud solutions), yet will provide the desired results? If so, please explain. <br />7. Explain the typical set up and operational results of a workflow (queue) for managing an asset. <br />8. Explain the availability of active/passive systems for managing assets based on a custodian's involvement.<br />9. Explain native or add-on solutions that provide RFID or other physical location tracking capabilities for the asset management system. Include in the explanation how the system tracks physical assets, and what the accuracy is of such tracking capabilities (i.e. within 3 feet, etc.)<br />10. Explain the ability for asset management systems to manage assets in alignment with a chain of custody (i.e. an individual is always in change of an asset, from a legal definition perspective).<br />11. Highlight any problems/issues experienced with using an asset management system.<br />12. Show examples of the data reports generated by an asset management system. Describe how custodians can, on the fly, modify data report parameters without the need for developer involvement.<br />13. Show examples of bulk data processes (example: purge, update, check in, etc.).<br />14. Describe the ability to tailor reports to property custodians based on unique property tracking needs, such as a type of property, or a location.<br />15. What is a typical length of time for fully implementing an asset management system? <br />16. Describe the ability of asset management systems to interface via a standard data exchange (ex. web services), with other systems (ex. budget application). <br />17. Explain what is a typical length of time for fully implementing an asset management system.<br />18. Describe the ability of asset management systems to interface via a standard data exchange (e.g. web services, APIs), with other systems (ex. budget application). <br />19. Describe the ability of an asset management system to ingest previously tagged and scanned asset data from a structured (i.e. Oracle) database.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of providing: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HiSeq 2000, (Specified Brand Name, Illumina)</span></strong></p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard 500 employees.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide <br />services as below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROCUREMENT</span></strong>:<br /><br />1. HiSeq 2000, Catalog Number: SY-401-1001, Quantity: One (1). <br />2. Trade-In for GAIIX Sequencer, Serial Number: 300748.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Work</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background/Purpose</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for our services. NISC currently has three HiSeq2000 sequencers in full operation and an additional sequencer is needed to meet the sequencing demand. The instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run. This sequencing technology also provides an easy-to-use protocol that does not require emulsion PCR which allows for a self-contained system that minimizes handling errors and contamination concerns, eliminating the need for robotics or clean rooms.<br /><br />The HiSeq2000 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. It is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is upgradable to a new version of sequencer that will allow NISC to decrease the turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements for HiSeq 2000</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be compatible and able to run the same chemistry as Illumina's HiSeq2000, MiSeq, and Genome Analyzer IIx Systems.<br />&bull; Run time for 200 base run must be under 12 days.<br />&bull; Data should be able to be processed through NISC's data analysis software.<br />&bull; Preparation time for samples to load on the sequencer should take about a day.<br />&bull; Read length at least 100 bp.<br />&bull; Produce paired-end reads of 60 million per run.<br />&bull; Reagents are in convenient volumes and are ready-to-load.<br />&bull; Oil is not required for the optics.<br />&bull; Straightforward protocols that require no beads or emulsions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Upon arrival of equipment to destination, the package must be undamaged.<br />&bull; In the installation of the equipment, all parts including computer must be functional and running in proper order.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Dorothy Maxwell, Contract Specialist, at maxwelld@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by November 18, 2012 7:30 AM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<SOLNBR>M67854-13-I-5016
<RESPDATE>112012
<CONTACT>Mark C. Green, Email mark.c.green@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Product Manager, Combat Support Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), is seeking information from potential sources to satisfy its requirement for a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for its Extended Boom Forklift (EBFL). The SLEP is intended to return the Marine Corps fleet of EBFL's to like new condition (0 hours/ 0 miles).
<p>As part of the SLEP effort, the Marine Corps will require that several engineering changes be made to all EBFL's. Specifically, the Government has a requirement to ensure that all EBFL's are capable of loading and unloading rotary aircraft with standard and 463L pallets. This requirement necessitates the forklift have a reduced or reducible height not to exceed 84 inches. The Government also has a requirement for each EBFL to be able to be configured with a "plug and play", STANAG Level II, armored solution for the EBFL operator cab.<br /><br />The Marine Corps currently has about 800 EBFL's in its fleet. MCSC purchased 530 EBFL's from JLG Industries during the time period of 2001 through 2005. During 2010 and 2011, MCSC purchased an additional 280 EBFL's also from JLG Industries.</p>
<p>To allow interested sources to assess the current condition of the Marine Corps fleet of EBFL's, the Marine Corps intends to schedule a site visit to a Marine Corps Logistics Base for an EBFL overview the second week of December. This date may change based on responses to the RFI. The intent is to allow companies to fully understand the needs of the USMC before submitting a proposal in response to the upcoming RFP. <br /><br />RFI responses must be submitted to MCSC no later than 20 November 4:00pm EST. Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed more than (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Responses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New. Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "Extended Boom Forklift (EBFL) Response to Request for Information". <br />Such responses should at a minimum provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Written confirmation of intent to participate in the future SLEP procurement for the EBFL</p>
<p>2. Estimated pricing to perform the SLEP and the reduced or reducible height, 463L pallet handling capability, and armored cab engineering changes; sufficient detail should be provided to explain the basis for such estimate<br /><br />3. Information explaining your capability to perform the EBFL SLEP; this should include a listing of key teaming partners and subcontractors and their various roles</p>
<p>4. Explanation as to your approach for performing the SLEP and the listed engineering changes; including your recommendations as to what specific subsystems, parts, and components should be subject to the SLEP and also whether such rework is to be provided to all EBFL's or on some lesser percentage; also address any modifications that may be required to accomplish the requested engineering changes, such as modified lift and tie down provisions which may be necessitated by the additional weight attributable to the armored cab.</p>
<p>This is only a Request for Information. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information -  Hypersonic Weapons Technologies
Description:
1.	This is a special notice open to U.S. industry and academia requesting information on technologies pertaining to hypersonic flight vehicles. The High Speed Weapons Office of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) is interested in reviewing technologies, in both the concept and development phases, which will enable/enhance the operation and survival of two classes of hypersonic vehicles. The first concept is a rocket boosted hypersonic glider (Mach 8-10) and the second concept is an airbreathing cruise vehicle (Mach 5-6). The durability requirement is several minutes at elevated temperature with high gradient heat fluxes.
 This request for information (RFI) includes power, materials, and structure technologies.
2.	Objective: Identify technologies that will enable/enhance the operation and survival of hypersonic vehicles in two speed regimes Mach (5-6) and Mach (8-10). A vehicle operating in the Mach 10 environment is expected to experience temperatures up to 2200Â°C therefore thermal and environmental barrier coating (TBC and EBC) technologies and ceramic composite structure technologies that can survive this environment are of extreme interest. Other technologies of particular interest include, but are not limited to: 
2.1.	Folding and morphing structures that allow the vehicle to be stored in a launch tube and allow for dimensional changes in the vehicle to optimize for reduced drag, controllability, and aerodynamic heating throughout the vehicle's flight profile.
2.2.	Long duration power systems with extended shelf life, including but not limited to ram-air turbines.
2.3.	High temperature electronic components and antennas which can operate at elevated temperatures, thereby reducing cooling requirements.
2.4.	Technologies that address not only performance but affordability for cooled structures and electrical components.
3.	Background: Studies have indicated that a long range rapid strike capability is operationally desirable.
 Both hypersonic boost-glide and airbreathing vehicles can address this capability need but affordability is a major concern. The boost-glide concept requires high temperature materials and aerodynamic shapes that can achieve improved lift-to-drag ratios. The airbreathing concepts lose volume to internal propulsion flowpath and fuel delivery systems. Both concepts have to be implemented within volume constraints of Navy ship and submarine launchers.
4.	Information Desired:
4.1.	Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) and Environmental Barrier Coating (EBC) Materials: Materials are of particular interest due to the extreme temperatures a hypersonic glider will experience. Temperatures have been estimated up to 1200Â°C for a vehicle operating at Mach 6 and 2200Â°C for operation at Mach 10.
 Information is desired for TBC and EBC technologies that may protect the hypersonic vehicle structure from this harsh operating environment. Non-ablative solutions are preferred. Current known issues with barrier coating technologies include inability to operate at temperatures up to 2200Â°C without ablating, poor thermal shock resistance, inability to retain sharp features in the structure during processing, and introduction of defect(s) in the barrier coating around geometries with high curvature or sharp features during fabrication. Information is desired for both the material itself and manufacturing techniques. Information on current known issues with barrier coatings and possible solutions are also desired.
4.2.	Carbon-Silicon Carbide (C-SiC) and Silicon Carbide-Silicon Carbide (SiC-SiC) Composites: Information is desired on C-SiC and SiC-SiC composites and manufacturing techniques.
 C-SiC and SiC structures are a valid option for the lower end of the Mach 5-10 environment but do not have the thermal properties required to operate at the high end of the environment without complex thermal barrier systems. Information regarding mechanical properties of these composites as a function of temperature is highly desired. Information pertaining to achievable geometries and attachment methods to other structures (i.e. joints, support structures, and actuators) is also desired.
4.3.	Space Constraints: Information is desired on folding and morphing structures technologies that will allow the vehicle to be launched from a ship or submarine launch tube, to be controlled, and to survive the high temperature environment.
 Space constraints are currently set by the Mk41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). Without a folding or morphing structure capability for the hypersonic vehicle, the vehicle will not be able to achieve the high Lift-to-Drag ratios (L/D) required for the desired fly-out ranges.
4.4.	Optimization of flight conditions: Information is desired for morphing structures technologies that enable the optimization of leading edge and other wing dimensions throughout a flight profile (up to Mach 10). Optimization of these dimensions would help with drag and aerodynamic heating across the majority of the Mach range of the vehicle rather than a narrow Mach range due to fixed wing dimensions. There is also a specific interest in this technology for waverider vehicles.
 Waveriders maximize L/D by minimizing underside pressure loss through shock flow containment.  The configurations are generated by constraining shapes within wedge or cone flow streamlines. While high L/D is achieved, the shapes often provide little volume for required missile subsystems. Also, the design approach leads to designs that are optimized about a narrow Mach range. Adding a morphing structure capability would allow for optimization across a large Mach range. 
4.5.	Flight Control: Information is desired for morphing structures technologies that enables control of flight through the change in wing/body shape. This technology would be used in lieu of actuated control surfaces. This may be directly related to the paragraph 4.4.
4.6.	Actuator and mission computer power: Information is desired for storable long flight duration power systems and high temperature hydraulic or electrical actuators for flight vehicle response.
 Temperatures may reach a point where magnetic actuators are no longer a viable option.
4.7.	High temperature electronic components, seekers, and antennas:  Information is desired on electronic components and antennas which can operate at elevated temperatures, thereby reducing cooling requirements. Information is also desired on seeker and antenna technology that may be able to operate through a window/structure and the boundary conditions surrounding the vehicle in hypersonic flight.
4.8.	Manufacturing Technologies: Information on technologies that address not only performance but manufacturing affordability for cooled structures and electrical components.
4.9.	Vehicle Packaging and components volumes: Volumetric efficiency has been shown to be a significant air vehicle performance driver.
 Technologies including but not limited to those that maximize fuel volume and minimize volume while maximizing lethality are of interest.
4.10.	Thermal management: Information is desired on vehicle thermal management including active cooling, phase change materials, and passive heat management.
4.11.	Analytical techniques: Information on analytical techniques that can address complex thermal-structure interaction problems (like the effects of thermal shock on a primary structure and interfacing material) or fluid-thermal-structures interactions (like the erosion of leading edges subjected to hypersonic flow) that can be used in lieu of expensive custom tests are also desired. 
4.12.	Other: Information on other methods or technologies that may aid in the management of the expected high temperature environment or optimization of the aerodynamic conditions around the vehicle is also welcome to be submitted.
 
5.	Please submit information with a cover sheet containing the following information:
5.1.	Company Name
5.2.	Address
5.3.	Name of Technical POC
5.4.	Technical POC Phone Number
5.5.	Description/Summary of information being submitted including a description of the technology and its applications
5.6.	To which category/categories from paragraph 4 does the information pertain?
5.7.	What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and/or Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the technology being presented?
6.	White papers are preferred but other forms of information will be accepted.
7.	This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.
  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.
8.	Submissions will be considered up to and including SECRET.

<CONTACT>Debra J. Parker, Acquisition Analyst, Email debra.j.parker@us.army.mil - Debra J. Parker, Contracting Specialist, Email debra.j.parker@us.army.mil
<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to award a Sole Source contract to Beckman Coulter, Inc., to provide a cost per test/reagent rental agreement for providing an automated analyzer for Complete Blood Count (CBC) analysis, reticulocytes, and body fluid analysis for the Hematology Department at Keller Army Community Hospital, West Point, New York. This contract will provide an upgrade to the current electrical impedance technology with the ability to perform body fluid and reticulocyte determinations on a completely automated platform. The contract will include onsite support for the correlation, validation, and implementation of the new system as well as training of employees or key operators. After thorough review of other sources that can possibly provide the required products, Beckman Coulter's DxH 800 model was the only analyzer that could meet the current needs of the Requiring Activity, regarding reliability, accuracy, and linearity capabilities of body fluid testing on the analyzer using electrical impedance and Volume, Conductivity, and Scatter (VCS) technology. The market research also indicated increased testing availability and proven electrical impedance technology advances for body fluid testing with the Beckman Coulter analyzer. Other analyzers utilize peroxidase staining instead of electrical impedance and VCS utilized on the Beckman Coulter DxH 800. The efficiency and specificity of the DxH 800 is higher than other similar analyzers. Nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) analysis on the DxH 800 has proven superior to similar analyzers. Other analyzers reviewed included numerous additional reagents that are not currently utilized by the Beckman Coulter DxH 800 analyzer or the Requiring Activity's current Beckman Coulter analyzer. Space in the laboratory is limited and the Requiring Activity cannot provide space for the additional reagents. The current Beckman Coulter reagents and methodology have been proven to produce accurate, reliable patient results, and a process change imposed by selecting new reagents would have significant impact on operations and possibly the quality of patient care. The smaller footprint of the Beckman Coulter DxH 800 cannot be compared to other vendor models with similar abilities.
<p>The period of performance requested is estimated on or about 29 November 2012 - 28 September 2017 (inclusive of option periods). The solicitation is not for competition and will be a Sole Source Award. The Solicitation Number is W91YTZ-13-R-0010. Parties interested in this announcement shall provide detailed information of their capabilities and certifications to clearly meet the requirements stated above. Responses will be via email, to include the company's name, point of contact, address, phone number, DUNS number, Tax ID, business size, CAGE code and solicitation number. All responses must be received by 9 November 2012. Responses may be emailed to Debra Parker (Debra.J.Parker@us.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquistion Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ocean Data Systems Limited, New Zealand, for a one time purchase of equipment to support data collection from multiple convoy driving studies being initiated in New Zealand and Australia in 2012 and running through 2015. The contractor will deliver seven Fugro 9205 receiver Kits (GPS and Glonass Ll/L2 operation; c/w AC/DC PSU and cable, internal battery. Mounting bracket and user guide) and seven GA 810 GNSS antenna kits (c/w antenna, antenna bracket, V bolts for antenna bracket, antenna bolt, antenna cable) to a New Zealand Defense Technology Agency (DTA) representative, who will receive the aforementioned equipment for the Department of Behavioral Biology at Walter Reed Army Institue of Research, Silver Spring Maryland. This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contractor, Ocean Data Systems Limited is the proprietary distributor for the Fugro GPS system currently in use by the Defense Technology Agency in New Zealand. As DTA is currently using the Fugro 9205 GPS system it is imperative that the seven new purchased units match what is currently in use in order to use the same satellite correction system in place. In addition, Ocean Data Systems is the only approved warrantor for the Fugro 9205 GPS system in New Zealand and if there was a problem with one of the units only Ocean Systems (or its Australian counterpart) could provide immediate support. While there is a USA distributor for the Fugro 9205 receiver Kits, there are a number of issues with purchasing from a USA distributor including not being in place to provide support to systems based in New Zealand; and the New Zealand and Australian distributers will not support systems bought through an external supplier. The units are intended for use exclusively in conjunction with New Zealand and Australian Defence Force vehicles for a minimum of three years. This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>DJAR-PGD-05-08 Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD ) 12 - Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractor<br />NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase 1.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. <br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service.</p>
<p>&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. <br />The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

	
	
	
	
	
    (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />2100-BOS-E1 SYSTEM FOR NOAA SHIP - 2012
<p><br />1.0 Scope</p>
<p>The 2100-BOS-E1 System is a small machine used to lubricate wire ropes used in NOAA's oceanographic research. The NOAA ship Oscar Dyson has procured new electromechanical CTD wire for installation in late 2012. New wire does not come lubricated and the time to lubricate the new wire is during installation when the new wire is being spooled off of a spool on shore onto the ship's CTD winch. Once the wire is initially lubricated, the wire will be lubricated annually using this same machine throughout the life of the electromechanical CTD wire. This same 2100-BOS-E1 System will also be used to lubricate new electromechanical net sonde wire that is being installed on the Dyson during late 2012, as well as wire on other NOAA ships located at MOC-P in Oregon.</p>
<p>2.0 Requirements</p>
<p>2.1 The system must not have rubber seals in the housing.</p>
<p>2.2 System must be electronically controlled and cannot require grease seals inside the housing.</p>
<p>3.0 Delivery Date</p>
<p>The delivery date for the 2100-BOS-E1 System is November 19, 2012. <br /><br />4.0 Points of contact for technical questions:<br /><br />Marine Operations Center - Pacific<br />2002 SE Marine Science Drive<br />Newport, OR 97365<br /><br />Attention: Jessica E.

Any questions regarding this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to mallory.roche@navy.mil. See Number Note 22.
<p>Number Note 22.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This announcement is to replace the announcement FA8204-12-R-TIPS.
<p>The AFNWC/PKA, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential responsible capable sources to provide, deliver, install, test, and demonstrate a new Telemetry Integrated Processing System (TIPS). This TIPS system is unique to Minuteman III (MMIII) operations out of Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). The TIPS is used to process and display telemetry data for Range users and Range Safety. Telemetered data from missile launches is collected at the 30th SW telemetry receiving sites and retransmitted via microwave links to the TIPS. Receiving and recording of raw data will continue to be provided by the Range. The new TIPS will need to be installed at VAFB in building 6601 and will need to interface with the existing Telemetry Analog Equipment Room (TAER).<br />Please see attached Sources Sought Synopsis for complete details of this announcement.</p>
<p>Previously, a technical requirements document was attached to this announcement. However, that&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;has been removed. The government no longer requests feedback on that&nbsp;technical requirements document. In addition, questions on the&nbsp;questionnaire (in the attached Sources&nbsp;Sourght Synopsis)&nbsp;that needed the technical requirements document to be answered were removed. Answers to those questions are no longer needed. Additional time has been granted to respond to this announcement due to this change. If you have already submitted a response, and would like to change it, have the changed response submitted by the new response date. If you have submitted a response and would not like to change it, please notify the primary point of contact listed in this notice to verify that no change will be made to your response. If you have not responded to the notice, but would still like to, submit your response by the new response date.</p>

<p>The VIS must provide intercom services among 2-20 crew members</p>
<p>The VIS must at a minimum interface up to (12) vehicle radio systems of varying types to include, but not limited to the following:<br />-VRC-110 (PRC-152)<br />-VRC-89-92<br />-VRC-103 (PRC-117F/G)<br />-VRC-104 (PRC)<br />-PRC-148 via VRC-111<br />-PRC-154 Riflemen<br />-PRC-155 Manpack</p>

Attachment B: Instructions to Offerors<br />4. Attachment C: Past performance Form<br />5. Attachment D: Sample Budget Submission and Invoice Submission Template<br />6.

<a href="mailto:yates.william@epa.gov">yates.william@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The anticipated due date for this solicitation has been changed as shown below.
The response to this solicitation has been changed to Friday, Novermber 9, 2012.  In addition, the following Questions and Answers are attached for your review: 
Questions and Answers for SOL-CI-12-00012
1.	Attachment 8, Past Performance Questionnaires:  Are our past/current clients identified in the past performance section of our proposal required to fill out and submit the past performance questionnaire to EPA or will EPA contact our references and collect this information?  If our references are required to submit the past performance questionnaires, can you please provide a due date and who to send them to?
ANSWER:  The instructions provided in the RFP under 1552.215-75 ?Past Performance Information? contemplates the offeror to merely provide references, descriptions and contact information.  We will take the initiative to act on contacting the references.  Your references should fill out the questionnaire(s), reference the solicitation number SOL-CI-12-00012 and send them back to EPA via email at:  yates.william@epa.gov or mail them to:  
U.S. EPA William Yates Ste 300 4411 Montgomery Road Norwood, Ohio 45212
2.	Are ODCs such as copying and printing, telephone, etc. to be included in our fixed-price cost for the Task 1 items, Document Reviews, or will these costs be reimbursed on an actual basis as is indicated for Tasks 2 and 3 on the bottom of Page 7 of the RFP?
ANSWER:  Any ODCs that you identify which may be related to Task 1 should be included within the ?fixed-price? for Task one.  They will not be reimbursed ?on an actual basis?.  With respect to Task 2, the only ODCs that will be identified with Task Two will be Travel expenses.   The ODCs for Task 3 are identified on page 8 of Attachment 7.
3.	On page 8 of the RFP, in Section B.6.A (2) under ?Order Procedures? and again on Page 1 of Attachment 3 ?Reports of Work? under Item I.(d)(3), the RFP states that the contractor must provide a breakdown of proposed labor hours or expended labor hours by labor category and a rationale for the labor categories.  Why is this necessary for fixed-price line items in Task 1 and 2 if the contractor is bound by the EPA-accepted fixed-price rates?  ANSWER:  For ?fixed-priced line items in Task 1 and Task 2, a breakdown of proposed labor hours or expended labor hours by labor category and a rationale for the labor categories are not required.  However, for Task 3 (the time and material type effort) it will apply.
4.	Is the offeror required to provide build-up tables showing indirects, G&A, and overhead to justify the fully-burdened (fixed) labor rates proposed for Task 3?  If subcontractors are also required to provide the build-up tables, is it acceptable for the subcontractors to provide this information directly to EPA? ANSWER:  While a table showing the indirects, G&A, and overhead showing the fully burdened fixed labor rate proposed for Task 3 would be nice, it is not required to justify the loaded rate.  While not required, if the subcontractor is providing a ?build-up table? they should provide that portion of their ?rates? proposal directly to the U.S. EPA at the address given in the answer to question one. 
5.	Other Direct Cost Table on Page 8 of Attachment 7:  What is the difference between ?Copying and Printing? and ?Reproduction??  Below the Table, what does the term ?OTCR portion? stand for? ANSWER:  Reproduction is considered the same as Copying.  However, while this is considered to be the same, the ODC chart is for proposal purposes and should be proposed as given.  
6.	For the labor classification Project Manager is Level 4 ? Normal qualification include PH.D Degree and 10+ years of experience.  Will any substitutions be allowed, an example would be Master Degree with between 15-20 year experience? ANSWER:  Yes you can substitute degrees and experience and submit them for review.

<DESC>VA Request For Information for a Web and Mobile Imaging Solution, Revision 1

THIS REVISION IS TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR PROPOSALS TO 11/2812

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.   Any and all information requested in response to this RFI is for Market Research purposes only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor.  All submissions to this RFI will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned. Items in appendix A and B provide the current business requirements and appendix C addresses specific information that is desired as part of the RFI. 

Background 

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the largest integrated health delivery system in the United States, delivering comprehensive care to approximately six million Veterans through a network of health care facilities owned and staffed by VA, academic medical affiliates and other contracted providers, contracted networks, and episodic fee-for-service purchases which administer 152 health care systems (HCSs) and medical centers (VAMCs), 974 Outpatient Clinics - most of which are extensions of a parent HCS/VAMC - and 133 Community Living Centers which deliver skilled nursing and extended care.  VHA sites of care are distributed across the United States, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with additional clinics in American Samoa, and Guam. 

Connecting this network into a meaningful and seamless healthcare system in which Veterans receive the right care no matter where they are in relation to the system's resources is critical in meeting the needs of Veterans.  New technology geared to improve how VHA's health care system connects and reducing the effects of geographic disparity is growing and presents an opportunity to increase VHA's ability to connect patients, healthcare providers and the data they need to interact in a meaningful way. An example of these new technologies are applications that allow the viewing of medical images on mobile platforms that can expedite diagnosis and treatment planning, facilitating communication among radiologists and referring clinicians.
The VA recently defined its requirements for web and mobile access to medical imaging to enable VA care providers and their patient's timely, convenient access to medical imaging information and in alignment and support of VA's strategic objectives:
"	Enhance the Veteran experience and access to health care
"	Establish strong VA management infrastructure and integrated operating model
"	Health Care Efficiency: Improve the quality of health care while reducing cost
"	Transform health care delivery through health informatics
This initiative also enables and accounts for several significant technical and workflow considerations:
1.	Accessibility: Providing a browser, platform and PACS agnostic web and mobile imaging solution
2.	Acceptance: Providing an FDA, cleared for diagnosis solution for both web and mobile imaging
3.	Security: Provide a secure environment for a web and mobile imaging solution.  Where patient data is protected at all times, the applications adhere to strict IT policies and personal devices can be centrally managed 
4.	Performance: Provide a state of the art imaging platform that includes basic imaging needs all the way to the advanced user.  The solution will perform under a variety of network restrictions but maintain the optimal performance for the user.
5.	Collaboration: Provide a solution that allows true real-time collaboration amongst geographically spread users.  Providing the highest of patient care in an ever changing healthcare environment.

Purpose 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Veterans Health Administration in determining the potential level of interest and technical capabilities within the commercial sector and the full extent of the requirements for a mobile medical image viewer application.
Vision
VHA's vision is to implement an application that will allow for the viewing of clinical images stored in VISTA imaging on mobile devices. VHA requirements for the application are set forth in Appendix A and B to this notice.

<DESC>NGB-AQ 18 July 2012 LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program 1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a justification and approval for a potential contracting action where only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Requiring Agency: Army National Guard (ARNG-TRS), 111 South George Mason Drive, Arlington, VA 22204-1373 Contracting Agency: National Guard Bureau, Systems &amp; IT Contracting Office (NGB-AQ), 111 South George Mason Drive, AHS 2, 4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22204-1373 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The NGB plans to establish a Delivery Order under GSA GS-02F-0154R contract vehicle for the procurement of Virtual Convoy Operations Trainer (VCOT) upgrades. The proposed sole source vendor is Raydon Corporation, ATTN; Michele Toliver 1420 Hockney Court, Port Orange, FL 32128. This is a sole source for required upgrading for 68 ARNG VCOTs currently at configuration 3.1 to the latest configuration 4.0. When complete this action will have upgraded 68 ARNG VCOT systems to configuration 4.0. As newer technology becomes available, advances in training and changes in operational equipment occur; the ARNG may continue to have a requirement to upgrade the VCOTs to include these latest advances. Previous and/or current contracts have upgraded the entire fielded fleet of 72 VCOTs to configuration 3.1. Now it is time to update those VCOTs to the most current training version (configuration 4.0). Without this upgrade the ARNG will not be able to maintain essential training requirements with respect to changes in combat equipment, doctrine/enemy tactics, missions and technology. 3. A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency&rsquo;s needs include estimated value. Line Items and Pricing Mfr. Part/Item # Manufacturer Product/Service Name Qty Unit Unit Price Total Price VCOT C3.1 TO C4.0 UPGRADE RAYDON CORPORATION VCOT C3.1 TO C4.0 UPGRADE 68 EA Total Line Items: $51,009,444.00 The period of performance will extend from the date of contract to required completion NLT 24months ARO. Delivery shall be to various State locations. 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting only one source capable of providing the supplies or services. Orders placed or BPAs established under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in FAR 6. However, an ordering activity must justify its action when only one source is capable of providing supplies or services. (B) only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized 5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor&rsquo;s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The GSA award is required to provide upgrades to the ARNG VCOT 68 fleet members. FAR 8.405-6, explains that the supporting rationale should include unique qualifications the contractor possesses in order to provide the required supplies or services. Raydon Corporation is the original equipment manufacturer and the only known source to provide software and hardware upgrades to the VCOT fleet. Raydon Corporation is the only known contractor to possess full proprietary data for the VCOT training system, and thus provide the necessary upgrades currently required by the Government. Raydon Corporation has been the provider for this legacy equipment since inception and is the only source that possesses an institutional knowledge and familiarity with the ARNG VCOT Fleet. Due to the existing training requirements, numerous states and territories require these upgrades in order to maintain a common operating platform minimizing the risk of inadequately trained personnel. Failure to provide support for this request severely limits the ARNG&rsquo;s capabilities and ability to adequately train its warfighters. Due to the critical nature of training to the ARNG, it is imperative that these remaining fleet systems be upgraded to the latest configuration 4.0. Failure to implement the necessary upgrades could severely impact the ARNG mission. 6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. The requirement for a synopsis is waived based upon FAR 5.202(a) (11). 7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost/price to be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b) (2) (ii) (v) based on a comparison of proposed prices to previous prices paid under the previous task order for the same or similar items and comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. 8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. Market research has revealed that there is only one company, the incumbent (Raydon Corporation), which can fulfill this requirement to upgrade existing systems. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of only one source capable of providing required supplies and/or services. None 10. Any other facts supporting the justification and approval for other than full and open. Non-applicable 11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made. IAW FAR Subpart 8.405-6 (2): (2) Posting. (i) Within 14 days after placing an order or establishing a BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that is supported by a limited-sources justification permitted under any of the circumstances under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the ordering activity shall&mdash; (A) Publish a notice in accordance with 5.301; and (B) Post the justification&mdash; (1) At the GPE http://www.fedbizopps.gov ; (2) On the Web site of the ordering activity agency, which may provide access to the justification by linking to the GPE; and (3) For a minimum of 30 days. 12.

Certifications and Approval from the Contracting Officer: Based on the aforementioned reasons and in accordance with USC 2304-(c) (1) and FAR 8.405-6, the Contracting Officer is justified in awarding the order to the incumbent contractor because there is no other responsible source available. I hereby certify that the data which forms the basis for this justification is accurate and complete and that the purchase request covers only the minimum requirements to satisfy the needs in the best interest of the government. The Contracting Officer has certified that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief IAW FAR 8.405-6. The Limited Sources Justification and approval explains that &ldquo;there is no other contractor that could start up and provide continuous uninterrupted operations&rdquo; to the existing VCOTs supporting the Army National Guard. Approvals - Approved IAW, FAR 8.404(d), ordering activity has determined that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the Governments needs. I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
