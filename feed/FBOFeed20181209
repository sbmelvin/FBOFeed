However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>The Department of Compact Operations (DCO), Sector Operations Division (SO) is seeking a Full-Time Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to serve as an Associate Director or Director in the Gender and Social Inclusion (GSI) Practice Group. The PSC shall serve as a GSI lead for projects in at least two countries in various stages of development and implementation. The PSC will also support GSI's technical leadership role to build and share knowledge and best practices on effective integration of social inclusion strategies.</p>
<p>The PSC will report to and be supervised by the Practice Lead and Senior Director (PLSD) for GSI.</p>
<p>This position is not authorized to supervise any Federal employees.</p>
<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>
<p>5.	Duties</p>

<p>2.

<p>5.	Other duties as assigned.</p>
<p>b)	Travel</p>
<p>MCC estimates that the incumbent will be required to undertake 4-8 international trips annually (2-4 trips per country).</p>
<p>c)	Supervisory Controls</p>
<p>The supervisor sets the overall assignment objectives, program emphasis and resources available. The incumbent independently develops the deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee meets regularly with the supervisor to keep him/her informed of progress, potentially controversial matters, and problems with far-reaching implications. Completed work is reviewed for its impact on broad MCC policy objectives and program goals.</p>
<p>d)	Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of broad administrative and program policy statements, basic legislation, or local laws that require extensive interpretation. The employee uses judgment and discretion in determining intent, and in interpreting and revising existing policy and regulatory guidance for use by others within or outside the Department of Compact Implementation. The employee is recognized as an expert and established practitioner in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on program planning and evaluation as it relates to social and gender assessment issues and programs.</p>
<p>e)	Complexity</p>
<p>Work consists of a variety of duties to plan and direct work efforts to address program issues where existing policies and precedents do not exist. Incumbent determines what needs to be done by conducting extensive research and analysis to assess the nature and scope of problems/issues and to develop comprehensive solutions. Assignments are complicated by the need to deal with subjective concepts and findings and conclusions are highly subjective and not readily susceptible to verification through replication of study methods or reevaluation of results. Options, recommendations, and conclusions take into account and give appropriate weight to uncertainties about the data and other variables which affect long-range program performance.</p>
<p>f)	Scope and Effect</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to analyze and evaluate major aspects of substantive, MCC mission-oriented programs. The employee develops long-range program plans, goals, objectives, and milestones to evaluate the effectiveness of social and gender impact programs. The employee resolves problems or copes with issues which directly affect the accomplishment of principal MCC program goals and objectives. The employee develops regulations or guidelines for the conduct of program operations, or new criteria for measuring program accomplishments. Study reports contain findings and recommendations of major significance to MCC top management and often serve as the basis for new administrative systems, legislative initiatives, regulations, or programs.</p>
<p>g)	Personal Contacts/Purpose of Contacts</p>
<p>Personal contacts are with numerous analysts, specialists, and professional staff from within and outside the agency in a moderately unstructured setting. The purpose of contacts is to influence, motivate, or persuade persons or groups who are typically skeptical, resistant, or uncooperative, and who must be approached skillfully to obtain the desired effect.

<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>

<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure.
