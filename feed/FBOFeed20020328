<DESC>NA The TRADOC Acquisition Center intends to contract sole source with Tec Masters Inc. current Contract DABT60-97-D-0007, for an additional twelve months, beginning 2 May 2002 through 1 May 2003.  Due to Fort Sill's transformation to a Futures Development Int egration Center (FDIC) model causing the merger of combat developments, training developments, distance learning, concepts and doctrine, battle lab experimentation and user representation in system management and development, significant issues arose which  have prevented projecting the requirements adequately for a follow-on acquisition.   This extension will cover all areas included in the current contract and allow for complete needs assessment to be accomplished.  This is an interim measure.  Any follow- on acquisition will utilize full and open competition after consideration of mandatory sources and socio-economic programs.  This is not a request for proposal.   Point of contact for this requirement is: Ruby M. Kepley, Contracting Officer, 757-878-1351, kepleyr@tac.eustis.army.mil, or Joyce Jenkins, Contract Specialist, 757-878-1351, jenkinsj@tac.eustis.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Diffusion Barrier Coating to be applied onto Mo-Re. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase these services from The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1),"only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Currently NASA Langley Research Center has an agreement with The Pennsylvania State University to conduct this diffusion barrier coating.  It is in the best interest of the Government to continue this effort with Penn State to ensure consistent results in microstructure, adherence, composition, and thickness of the coating to the Mo-Re. In addition, award to another source would result in a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 4, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NA The objective of this acquisition effort will be to provide for software development, system engineering and support services for a family of Army PM Ground Combat C2 programs to include: (1) the Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A), (2) the Man euver Control System (3) the Combat Service Support Control System (4) the Common Software family of products.   The effort will require the successful bidder to define a common infrastructure and architecture that supports integration of common and system unique applications required to support the functional, performance and interface requirements of this family of  products.  The goal is to define a common infrastructure and define/develop common applications in a manner that builds upon/provides an evolution from the Army Battle Command System V7.0 architecture and leverages existing and planned joint components wi thout constraining growth/schedule within the individual Army program and ABCS System of Systems requirements and allows for a better integrated, more affordable, more robust and extendible ABCS core infrastructure and application environment within schedu le/cost/design constraints of the individual programs and the ABCS environment. This effort will also (1) provide for the continued software, training and fielding support required to field and maintain the current and newly developed GCCS-A, MCS, CSSCS and CS products (2) provide for a transition of development, maintenance, integrat ion & fielding responsibility from the current development/support contractors (3) provide for a migration plan from the current architecture/design that allows for evolutionary insertion of the new architecture/design/components in concert with the indivi dual program objectives and the ABCS System of Systems objectives. The effort will further provide for not only the system engineering services required to define the architecture/design for the PM Ground Combat C2 programs identified above, but to provide system engineering services associated with definition of the Syst em of Systems level ABCS environment currently supported by a System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SSEI) ABCS team.  The SSEI task will be a separate task that supports the System of Systems level ABCS definition of requirements, communications a rchitecture, centralized infrastructure, vertical/horizontal interoperability, and system of systems level integration across ABCS systems.  System engineering products developed by the SSEI team will flow down to not only the GCC2 system engineering activ ity to shape the infrastructure/architecture but will also affect the other ABCS Battlefield Functional area developers in terms of definition of requirements, interfaces and integration requirements for future ABCS versions.  The other ABCS BFA systems wi ll have input into the defined common infrastructure/architecture defined under the SSEI efforts.   A draft statement of work (SOW), System/Subsystem Specification for the family of products and solicitation will be released on the Army CECOM Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) ( https://abop.monmouth.army.mil) in the May timeframe.  This effo rt will also be targeted to be briefed at the Advanced Planning Briefing for Industry in May.   This notice is not a request for bids or proposals, but is intended to advise industry of the planned acquisition activity.  Questions/responses to the SOW/SSS/ Solicitation will be responded to via the IBOP process when posted in May.  Target for award is Spring/Summer CY03.

<DESC>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES - 

The Office of Acquisition Management has established a competitive technical assistance (CAP) program limited to participation by Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)*, Hispanic Serving Institutions*, American Indian Serving Institutions*, Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions*, and other postsecondary minority institutions as defined under The Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended) [20 U.S.C.?1135 d-5].    The purpose of this program is to foster MIHE participation in research and development activities that contribute substantially to the Federal Highway Administration?s (FHWA) mission and to help prepare the faculty and students at MIHE?s to successfully participate in the competitive research arena.  The program is established in accordance with Section 5001 (a)(1) of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), and authority to enter into awards with MIHE?s is granted at: 23 U.S.C. ?403; 49 CFR ?1.48; and Executive Orders 13021, 13125, 13230, and 13256.

*HBCU is defined at 34 CFR ?608.2 as an accredited college or university, established prior to 1964, whose principle mission was and is, the education of African-Americans. 

*Indian Serving Institution, which includes Tribal Colleges, as well as Bureau of Indian Affairs affiliated institutions is defined at 34 CFR ?410.2.

*Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) is defined at 34 CFR ?606.2.

*Native Hawaiian Serving Institution is defined at 20 U.S.C.?1135 d-5(3).

A minimum of 20 percent cost sharing by the recipient is a requirement under this initiative.

All awards made under this program will be relevant to one or more of the FHWA?s five strategic goals of mobility, safety, productivity, human and natural environment, and national security.  The MOBILITY goal concerns the continual improvement of the public?s access to activities, goods, and services through the preservation, improvement, and expansion of the highway transportation system and enhancement of its operations, efficiency, and intermodal connections.  The SAFETY goal concerns continual improvement of highway safety by reducing the number of fatalities and injuries.  The PRODUCTIVITY goal concerns the continual improvement of the economic efficiency of the Nation?s transportation system to enhance America?s position in the global economy.  The HUMAN AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT goal concerns the protection and enhancement of the natural environment and communities affected by highway transportation.  The NATIONAL SECURITY goal seeks the improvement of the capacity and operation of the highway system to support defense mobilization.  Our strategic plan recognizes the inherent nature of cross-cutting goals, under which success in one area flows directly to success under a second or third goal.  As such, our Corporate Management Strategies that embody the principles contained in the Quality Journey, provide the overarching framework that will enable us to achieve our vision under all goals.

On or about April 4, 2002, the FHWA will issue a Request for Applications (RFA) for its Fiscal Year 2002 program.  The solicitation will include specific projects for consideration.  Eligible offerors will be invited to submit applications for one or more of the projects.  

THE RFA WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY AT: http://www.eps.gov UNDER DOT/FHWA. 

It is the applicant?s responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of the RFA and amendments (if any).  Potential applicants will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFA and amendments (if any).

The EPA's OTAQ office has worked to develop methods to evaluate various Inspection and Maintenance (IM) program scenarios and their impact on air quality.  The EPA seeks proposals to provide a plan for the development of fleet evaluation methods that may be used to estimate the emissions of an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) system.  The plan/study shall focus on quantifying the emissions of an OBD fleet not subjected to (IM) requirements so that these baseline, No-IM emissions may be compared to those emissions from an OBD fleet that is subjected to IM testing.         The work to be performed shall include: collection of RSD data from a No-IM OBD fleet at an agreed upon site over three successive years; submit two (2) reports outlining the procedures used to estimate the No-IM OBD fleet emissions; and compare these results to results obtained from other E-23 project studies focused on estimating the OBD fleet emissions from areas with functioning IM programs.  All existing data or newly collected data shall adhere to the RSD data collection guidelines developed by previous E-23 fleet characterization studies.  If the data do not conform to these guidelines, then the discrepancies shall be identified and the impact these discrepancies might have on the analyses shall be discussed and quantified where possible.           The full Statement of Work will be included as an attachment to the solicitation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the EPA, technical, price and other factors considered.  The full technical evaluation criteria will be included in the solicitation.  The solicitation will be available on or about 11 April 2002 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/  It is estimated proposals will be required within 15 days of solicitation issuance.

<DESC>The DIMHRS requirement was originally synopsized on the Commerce Business Daily (CBDNet), synopsis number W-270 SN50Z071 dated 27 September 2001. __________________________________________ The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to competitively award a contract for the Development and Implementation component of the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS).  DIMHRS, as fielded, will provide Personnel and Pay (Pers/Pay) services for Department of Defense (DoD) Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard service members worldwide as well as personnel and pay support throughout the life cycle of a Service member's career.  DIMHRS will provide support across the full operational spectrum; peacetime and war, through mobilization and demobilization, deployment and redeployment.  The DIMHRS System will collect data on every aspect of the Service member's career.  It will retain and maintain that data in a single, comprehensive record of service that will be available to the Service member.  The data must be accessible by the Service personnel chiefs, CINCs, military personnel and pay managers, and authorized users in OSD and other Federal Agencies. Through the use of Business process reengineering the DIMHRS Program will continue to accommodate changes to both policy requirements and processes within the personnel and pay functional arena for the life of the system. It is the government's intent to implement DIMHRS Pers/Pay utilizing the previously awarded DOD enterprise software license for the Human Resource (HR) components of PeopleSoft Version 8. The full and open competition and subsequent down-select will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be a full and open competition between all interested parties.  The Government intends to award up to three firm fixed priced contracts.  Each of these contracts will contain fixed priced options for the of Development and Implementation component.  In the second phase, the three selected contractors will build their prototype based on their proposed technical solution set. The working prototype will consist of a core PeopleSoft Version 8 HRMS functionality applied to the DoD Personnel and pay environment. Each contractor's proposal and prototypes will be evaluated to determine the best value for the Government. This down-selection process will leave one contractor to develop and sustain the system over the life of the contract. The Government will be holding an Industry Day on October 15, 2001 in New Orleans, LA at University of New Orleans campus on Elysian Fields. Face-to-face meetings will be scheduled between October 16-19, 2001 with interested Contractor's and their team members. Face-to-face meetings must be scheduled in advance. Call Moira Eiserloh at 504-697-4534 by close of business October 10, 2001 to schedule a time to meet with the Government team.  For more information on the Industry Day, Meetings and procurement package, review and monitor the SPAWAR Business Opportunities webpage.

The EPA has  a requirement for testing fine particulate matter as follows: FINE PARTICULATE MATTER- DILUTION SAMPLING TRAIN SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS  - BACKGROUND 	The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)  is currently developing a standard testing procedure for fine particulate matter (FPM) which  is based on particles 2.5 microns and smaller being emitted from source emissions. In the ongoing development effort OAQPS has concluded that a new type of test equipment based on a dilution sampling train design must be used. To be effective this equipment must be of a size and design that it can  transported to field sites and be used on stack platforms. System hardware that comes in contact with the stack gas sample shall be made of glass or Teflon or metal coated with Teflon. The system pumps and electronics shall work on 120 volt AC. The maximum weight of system components shall not  exceed 70 pounds per component. Specific requirements: 1.	System will include in-stack cyclones for PM10 and PM2.5 in accordance with U.S. EPA Preliminary Method 004. System will include all necessary hardware to attach the cyclones to a standard Method 5 sampling probe. 2.	System will include an  isokinetic sampling probe as per US EPA Method 5. The sampling probe shall be 5'EL with a glass liner and heater. 3.	System will include a heated enclosure for the sample gas venturi flow meter.  The heated enclosure will be capable of maintaining temperature of 10?F higher than the stack  temperature.  The enclosure will include a front probe support and rear mixing chamber support.  The enclosure will include type K thermocouples for (1) monitoring the enclosure temperature and (2) monitoring the sample gas temperature. 4.	System will include a dehumidifier for the dilution air.   The dehumidifier will be capable of removing 1-7/8 pints/hour of water from 70 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air at 80?F and 60% relative humidity (RH).  The electrical requirements for the dehumidifier will be 15 Amps at 120V/60Hz.  The dehumidifier will be low maintenance, i.e., not requiring  periodic water removal or refrigerant service. 5.	System will include a high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter for the dilution air.  The HEPA filter will be rated for a minimum of 70 CFM and provide a minimum 99.97% efficiency for 0.30 micron size dioctal phthalate (D.O.P) particles. 6.	System  will include dilution/mixing components made of tri-clamp flange design.  These components will be Teflon coated stainless steel.  The components include the following: 	a.	Adapter from sample venturi to mixing tee (includes a thermocouple tap). 	b.	Mixing tee (1.5" size). 	c.	Adapter from dilution  hose to mixing tee (includes a pressure tap). 	d.

Pipeline Safety Research and Development

DTRS56-02-BAA-0003, due May 6, 2002, POC Warren D. Osterberg, Contracting Officer, Phone:  202-366-6942, Fax:  202-366-7974, Email: warren.osterberg@rspa.dot.gov

CONTRACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers) for cost-shared activities to address research that will complement and enhance pipeline safety.  White papers are not to exceed five pages per project and must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.

In April 2002, RSPA's Office of Pipeline Safety (RSPA/OPS) will hold two (2) meetings to provide additional information on this BAA.  Interested parties may obtain more details on the exact meeting dates and locations, register for the meetings, and submit questions they would like answered via the Internet Web site http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  Space will be limited and registration prior to the meetings is required.  No on-site registration will be available.  Meeting participants are encouraged to submit questions they would like answered at least one week prior to the meeting.  A meeting summary and inquiries and comments from the meeting will be posted on above Internet Web site within 48 hours after the meetings are completed.

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open through May 6, 2002, unless otherwise amended.  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit research projects to assure the long-term integrity and security of the nation's gas and hazardous liquid pipeline network.  A team of experts will review white papers submitted in response to this announcement and offerors will be advised accordingly as the evaluation is completed.

SCOPE:  In November 2001, a RSPA/OPS Research & Development workshop brought together government agencies (Federal, state, local and international), research institutions, pipeline companies and their associations, standards organizations, and public representatives to begin development of a national pipeline safety research agenda.  The workshop and its conclusions are described further at the Internet web site http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  RSPA is now soliciting white papers for research projects in the first of three major research areas highlighted by the November 2001 workshop:

Damage Prevention and Leak Detection:  Activities should focus on improving non-destructive and non-intrusive monitoring technologies to detect unauthorized activity near the pipeline, pipeline damage at the earliest stages, and encroachments along the pipeline (whether accidental or intentional).  Specific topics of interest include the following:

o	In-line inspection (ILI) for damage or defects - A variety of "smart" pigs and other in-line inspection technologies that can monitor for, detect, and measure corrosion, cracks, and other forms of damage to pipe walls.  Examples of project interest include ILI for mechanical damage or corrosion, use of "magnetic telescopes" to identify corrosion areas, use of sensing coils that wrap around pipes to map corroded surface areas, and use of ultrasound or guided waves to inspect "unpiggable" pipeline.

o	Pipe location (steel and plastic) - Quick, accurate new location techniques for pipelines would save time and cost of maintenance and repair, as well as allowing accurate marking to protect against 3rd party damage.  Examples of project interest include use of magnetic plastic pipe, ground penetrating radar, and 3-D underground utility location capabilities.

o	Real-time sensors attached to pipelines - Self contained sensors in physical contact with the pipe that can utilize acoustical or other readings to detect possible 3rd party contact, leaks, or other signs of damage.  Examples of project interest include technologies to pinpoint exact locations of damage or intrusion, adaptation of leak detection technologies in multi phase flow conditions, and developing "acoustic libraries" to minimize false positives, and ensure that significant hits are identified.

o	Airborne chemical mapping - Approaches using aerial surveillance, either in remote regions or in high consequence areas (HCAs), with optical technologies for right-of-way monitoring and other pipeline safety concerns.  Examples of project interest include use of satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) to monitor pipeline conditions.  As the level of resolution of cameras and sensors improve and become more practical, developing knowledge of encroachment, pipeline condition, spill seriousness with radar surveillance, infrared detection of gas loss are may be productive.

o	Real-time right of way monitoring without contacting pipelines - Fiber optic lines buried above, alongside, or inside a buried pipeline that can detect small movement or vibration in the ground caused by the operation or large equipment near the pipeline.  Examples of project interest include feasibility work on this and related technologies may be productive.

o	Encroachment monitoring - Reduction of damage to pipeline infrastructure and maintenance of pipeline services through encroachment monitoring technologies may have significant payoff.  Examples of project interest include investigation of innovative approaches to pre-empt 3rd party damage to pipelines by detecting ongoing encroachment of pipelines and their rights-of-way.

o	Improved directional drilling - Refining the direction of the ongoing drilling process may have substantial potential, and should be investigated.  Examples of project interest include new drilling techniques that can prevent accidental damage to existing pipelines. 

o	Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) - New approaches or technologies that can be used for NDE of operational pipelines are of increasing interest.  Examples of project interest include innovative application of ultrasonics, intelligent structures, nano-scale sensors and other techniques. 

In the next few months, RSPA will be soliciting white papers for research projects in the remaining research areas that were highlighted by the November 2001 workshop.  These research areas include "Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring" and "Improved Materials Performance."  Research for "Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring" will focus on improving technology for operating, controlling, and monitoring the integrity of pipelines.  Topics of interest include stress corrosion cracking detection, corrosion control, and related risk assessment (e.g., standard methods of risk and reliability analysis to pipelines, understanding the key factors that influence the reliability of older pipelines, etc.).  Research for "Improved Material Performance" will focus on improving pipeline materials to extend the integrity and lifetime of installed pipelines and their various components.  Topics of interest include damage and defect resistant materials, higher grade/strength steel, higher pipe design pressure, welding and joining, composite pipe, and pipe coatings. 

WHITE PAPERS:  RSPA is soliciting white papers on proposed research activities dealing with damage prevention and leak detection.  

Each white paper, not to exceed five pages including appendices and backup materials, must include sufficient information to evaluate the following areas:

1.	Cost sharing contributions of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost;
2.	Offeror's understanding of the "state of the art" in the research area they are proposing to address;
3.	Demonstration of understanding of the need that the offeror intends to address and quantifiable metrics of how the proposed work will result in improvements over existing technologies;
4.	Technical merit of the approach or concept to successfully address the need;
5.	Time line to implement proposed technologies and concepts into practice in the pipeline industry (one to three years preferable);
6.	Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in federal research programs;
7.	Feasibility & risk of the proposed work; and
8.	Realism of cost estimate.

All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

<DESC>Statement of Work: 

Development of Collections Packaging/Storage and Transport Equipment Specifications

Background:

	In spite of ongoing efforts to correct packaging/storage and transport deficiencies for Library collections, inadequate storage and minimally adequate transportation devices are still damaging many of the Library's holdings.  Both storage and transportation are extremely important I the life of collections, as both can be the cause of immediate and serious damage.  
The specifications will assist the Library in purchasing of safer, more effective and efficient storage furnishings and transportation devices.

	A shelving consultant has been hired to assist in the efficient, modular storage of collections at Fort Mead, Module I.  This effort has successfully streamlined storage of regular book collections.  In the future, special collections will need to be stored, packaged and transported both on-site on Capitol Hill, and where determined appropriate by the Divisions of the Library of Congress, stored off-site at Fort Meade.  The nature of these materials is much less homogenous and will required expertise, consultation and specifications to ensure that appropriate solutions are implemented.

Scope:

	This project will focus on providing specifications for improvements for the packaging/storage and transportation of collections for which these matters have historically been difficult or where damage has occurred.  These are the needs that a currently identified:

	1.	Storage and transportation of oversized paper-based materials, such as maps and posters, many of which are very valuable.
	2.	Specifications for more adequate shelving and support for folio books - taller than 18".
	3.	Secure locking trucks with adequate wheels for ease of transporting book collections.
	4.	Furnishings that can safely store and equipment that can safely transport unusually-sizes objects, such as globes.
	
Deliverables:

	1.	The vendor will be expected to survey the collections storage and transportation needs of the Library as part of the contract, with the assistance of the COTR, determine the priority and time frame for procurement.
	2.	The vendor will supply specifications (including drawings, where appropriate) that satisfy the requirements for both storage and transportation of unusually sized and shaped objects in collections.
	3.	The vendor's specifications will identify all aspects of the furnishing or transportation device to ensure receipt of the highest quality of product available.
	
	
Results:

	The Library's Conservation Division, Collections Management Division, Special Collection's Division and Preservation Research and Testing Division will review the specifications and the Library will place orders to ensure that the specifications can be met.

	The Library will purchase examples of recommended storage and transportation devices and provide testing through the Preservation Research and Testing Division to ensure the quality of materials and function of devices.

	The findings and any problems will be reported to the COTR, and as necessary to the Contracting Officer, to ensure that specifications and services provided meet project expections.

Period of Performance:

	Eighteen months from award of contract.

Submit proposal and price separate.  All technical question can be email to adoz@loc.gov Reference: RFQ02-C19

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Office of Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding up to two (2) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to professional, licensed firms to provide architectural (prime or joint venture) and engineering services for residential projects only, including new construction, renovation, restoration and system replacement projects at Foreign Service posts worldwide. Construction projects are not expected to exceed $10 million.  Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work.  In those cases, as in large design-bid-build projects (where construction value is over $10 million), such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in follow-on work or design-build teams for that project. Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $50,000 in task orders over the life of the contract. The total amount of orders issued under each contract shall not exceed $3,000,000 per year.  The contract will be for professional services to include, but not be limited to, facility assessments and documentation, architectural and engineering studies, site utilization studies and master planning, landscape design, preliminary designs, design development, working drawings, specifications, construction estimates, design reviews of other A/E firms, value engineering studies or reviews, and services during construction. Services may also include developing requests for proposals for build-lease housing or evaluating housing-related proposals.  Services shall include all disciplines related to residential construction; i.e., architectural, landscape architecture, space planning, kitchen design, electrical, lighting design, mechanical, structural, and civil/geotechnical engineering; as well as routine administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved; and ascertaining and working within the U.S. Government?s requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards at the overseas project sites. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  The preparation of construction documents via alternative documentation methods (e.g. design-bid-build plans, specifications, and design-build) is required.  Construction documents shall be submitted with AutoCAD version 2000 or higher (until October 2002, AutoCAD R14.01 or higher files are acceptable), for each submission.  Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date will be considered for selection using the following evaluation criteria ? 100 points maximum:  a) Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, as listed above.  Show any licenses, registrations, or other certifications, as well as awards and other indicators of high quality performance - 25 pts.  b) Specialized experience and technical competence in planning and design, rehabilitation/renovation, sustainable design, adaptive reuse, and system replacement projects involving multiple disciplines, e.g., architectural, mechanical, civil/geotechnical, structural, and electrical, for single and multifamily residences and support facilities ? 25 pts.  c) Internal Quality Management Plan, past performance, schedule, and cost control procedures.    Describe internal quality control and assurance plan and firm's ability to successfully provide and coordinate discipline efforts either in-house or with consultants.  If using consultants, demonstrate this success as a team in providing similar services.  Indicate effectiveness by listing award amount, A/E design schedule (planned vs. actual), final design estimate and construction change order rate for five projects within the past five years.  Provide this information in a matrix format.  Each firm's past performance(s) and performance ratings will be reviewed  - 25 pts.  d) Specialized experience and technical competence in the renovation and restoration of historically significant buildings - 10 pts.  e) Specialized experience in design-build projects, including the preparation of bridging documents, writing performance requirements, and developing statements of work for design-build projects - 10 pts.  f) Previous experience with overseas projects and knowledge of foreign building codes and standards and construction practices ? 5 pts max.  Failure to address each of the evaluation criteria, in writing, will result in failure to qualify.  Additionally, failure to provide the requisite information will result in failure to qualify.  This is not a request for proposals.  Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award.  The DOS Fiscal Year 2002 subcontracting goals are: small business 40%; small disadvantaged business 5%; women-owned business 5%; HUBZone business 2.5%; and service disabled veteran business 3%.  The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541330, $4.0 million average.    A/E firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit two copies of the following:  (a) Standard Form 254 Architect/Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, (b) Standard Form 255 Architect/Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project (maximum of 100 pages). Upon notification of selection, the A/E will be required to submit a copy of its Quality Management Plan (QA/QC) Plan within 10 working days for review and approval.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier, Biological and Chemical Command (SBCCOM) intends to negotiate with Hamilton Sundstrand Sensor Systems (HSSS) in Pomona, CA, on a non-competitive basis (per FAR 6.302-1) for a new firm-fixed-priced production contract to obtain 14 Che mical-Biological Mass Spectrometer Block II (CBMS II) Systems in FY02, with an option for an additional 22 CBMS IIs in FY03. This proposed production contract is for highly specialized equipment which has taken over four years for HSSS and Oak Ridge Nation al Laboratory to develop and successfully test.  The CBMS II incorporates state-of-the-art mass spectrometry components, an auto-calibration system, a detection and identification algorithm based on extensive chemical and biological agent profiling and con figuration specifically tailored for insertion into the Interim Armored Vehicle-NBC Reconnaissance Variant(IAV-NBCRV) and the Joint Service Lightweight NBCRS (JSLNBCRS) systems. The units built under this effort will be inserted into JSLNBCRS and IAV-NBCRV  systems in support of technical and operational testing.  The CBMS II systems will be required to interface with specific sampling devices and central computers on both systems.   HSSS is the only contractor that has the necessary hardware and software ex pertise required to produce and deliver CMBS IIs which meet the U.S. Army’s requirements without substantial duplication of cost and within the schedule constraints of the IAV-NBCRV and JSLNBCRS programs. Opportunities for competitive subcontracting will b e present in the areas of subassembly and consumables.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) Core Genotyping Facility (CGF), ATC  plans to procure two AB Gene ALPS-300  Automated Heat Sealer and heat sealing film in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only combined synopsis/solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-06.  This requirement is set-aside for small business.  The North American  Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.   The ATC supports the NCI Core genotyping facility.  The AB Gene plate sealer uses air pressure to apply heat seals in a uniformly reproducible manner to plates of experimental samples.  The acquisition of this device is crucial to the high quality and cost efficient output of the NCI Core genotyping facility.  Current methods of sealing plates involve manual labor, which is prone to variation leading to loss of experimental data.  This manual process also leads to repetitive motion and other related medical problems for the staff.  Possible savings in addition to data and the health of the staff will amount to hundreds of dollars a week.  Due to the use of this equipment in the processing of valuable experimental samples in a variety of scientific processes, the apparent successful quotes shall provide equipment for testing for a 30-day period.  MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS: 1) Automated Heat Sealer must include four (4) rolls of sealing film and foil with each unit, must include one (1) year parts and labor warranty; 2) Voltage: 110/120V, 50/60HZ; 3) Plate Compatibility: Can seal skirted plates of different heights without the need for a plate adapter; 4) Sealing Rate: < ten (10) seconds; 5) Air flow Requirements: 50 liters per minute; 6) Integration: I/O port Second socket - RS232; 7) Able to use Multiple Media: Easy Pierce, Easy Peel, Clear Peel, and Easy Pierce Strong sealing films; 8) Must be compatible with ABU7900 Sequence detection system, any thermocycler, and other laboratory equipment.   
This requirement includes MANDATORY INFORMATION: Quoters/Vendors must provide descriptive literature as stated in FAR clause 52.214-21 (May 2001), warranties, and/or other materials that demonstrate their quote meets the foregoing requirements.  AWARD: It is anticipated that one award will be made from this solicitation.  EVALUATION: the major evaluation factors for this RFQ include technical and price factors.  The technical portion of the offers/quotations will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  The following technical evaluation will be used by the Government when reviewing the technical portion of the quotation.  The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes: TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1)  Ability to provide an AB Gene ALPS Heat Sealer or equivalent device that can be utilized in the NCI Core genotyping facility and that is easy to operate, reliable, maintenance free, and quite in its operation (25 points): 2)  The Automated Heat Sealer instrument should provide the minimum specifications stated in the aforementioned synopsis for the purpose of sealing samples in plate format that are used in NCI wide genotyping studies.  The ability to seal plates will be judged by the ability to provide both permanent and temporary seal that eliminate evaporation and can be used in conjunction with ABU 7900 Sequence detection system, any thermocycler, and other laboratory equipment (25 points): 3)  Provide sufficient detail of application specifications regarding materials and temperatures.  The vendor shall also provide appropriate warranty,  documentation, training, and assistance (25 points): 4) Vendor shall supply ALPS Heat Sealer for testing in the laboratory before award of purchase order can be made.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition basis to establish and maintain a Resource Center for Primary Care Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs) under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($6 million).  The Agency anticipates one contract award for a  two year period of performance with three one-year options. The Resource Center will be responsible for performing needs assessments and providing consultative and other support services for a group of as many as 30 PBRNs (annually) that require technical assistance developing infrastructure or conducting exploratory research projects.  A PBRN is a group of ambulatory practices devoted principally to the primary care of patients, affiliated with each other and with an academic, professional or other organization, in order to investigate questions related to community-based practice.  The major objectives of PBRN activities are to expand the primary care knowledge base and to establish mechanisms to assure that new knowledge is incorporated into actual practice. Through a request for applications (RFA  HS-02-003 ? http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HS-02-003.html ), AHRQ intends to fund 25-30 PBRNs either to develop network infrastructure or to conduct exploratory/pilot research.  In addition, AHRQ intends to partner at a later date with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in supporting an additional 25-30 PBRNs to conduct projects aimed at promoting healthy behaviors in primary care settings.  It is expected that some of the funded PBRNs will have significant needs for technical, administrative and research expertise that cannot be met with limited grant resources.  
The Resource Center will serve as a link between the funded PBRNs and AHRQ, and will assess and provide, as appropriate, the consultants and other resources needed by each of the PBRNs in developing or implementing their network research activities.  The Resource Center will be tasked to:  (a) assess the stage of development and specific research needs of each funded PBRN; (b) provide expert consultants, where appropriate, to PBRNs in the areas of research data collection and aggregation, network research methodology development, electronic information technology, practice and research compliance with proposed HIPAA regulations, and procedures for securing institutional review board (IRB) approval of proposed research; (c) identify and provide PBRNs with linkages to specific expertise in the area of behavioral and social research; (d) assist AHRQ in the development and enhancement of a web-based system designed to foster communication and research collaborations with and among funded PBRNs and to serve as an electronic repository of PBRN-specific resources for research; and (e) assist AHRQ in planning and convening meetings of the funded PBRNs.  

Offerors are expected to have extensive knowledge of primary care research and, preferably, experience as a contractor or partner in one or more research projects conducted within a primary care PBRN.  The Resource Center is to be comprised of, or to have immediate access to, seasoned professionals with significant experience conducting or contributing to research in PBRN settings, including those with training and competencies in primary care, research methodology, information technology, and the protection of data privacy and confidentiality.  The Resource Center must also identify researchers and other expertise in the field of behavioral and social research and provide funded PBRNS access to these resources.  The Director of the Resource Center and other senior staff who will manage work to be performed under this contract should hold an advanced clinical, technical or professional degree, at the MD or PhD level, and should have significant experience working with both researchers and clinical primary care practitioners.  The Director should also have corporate level management experience that reflects an ability to command organizational resources and direct staff within the broader organization. In addition to the solicitation being available at this site, it will also only be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ's site at http:/www.ahrq.gov.  Once in AHRQ's home page, look under "Funding Opportunities: and then "Contract Solicitations." It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor AHRQ's Internet site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any subsequest amendments. Since it is not known who is downloading the solicitation, no bidders list will be available. It is estimated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about April 15, 2002, with proposals due May 29, 2002.

<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, proposes to acquire through full and open competition, a Research and Development (R&D) program entitled “Reactive IR Suppressor”.  The goal of this program is to d esign and fabricate a reactive engine exhaust infrared signature control system that will be demonstrated on a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter with a T700-GE-701C engine. This IR suppressor system will employ variable geometry exhaust nozzling to maximize eject or driven dilution/cooling flow, reducing engine exhaust IR signatures, while providing the capability to eliminate engine performance penalties by opening the exhaust nozzle, or unsuppressing the engine, in low threat environments.  The objectives of this  variable suppression system are: 1) 90% reduction in band IV engine and exhaust IR signatures broadside and tail-on, relative to current fleet suppressed Blackhawk helicopters, in the fully suppressed mode, and 2) no engine performance penalty, relative t o an unsuppressed engine, in the unsuppressed mode. Specific tasks associated with this work include, concept definition/preliminary and detailed design, ground test hardware fabrication, installation, test support and data evaluation, design finalization,  flightworthy hardware fabrication, aircraft integration support and flight test support. A single award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the greatest overall value to the Government as determined by the evaluation criteria  set forth in the solicitation.  Award will be made without discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions to be necessary.  A cost-plus fixed fee contract, with a thir ty-three (33) month period of performance, is contemplated for this acquisition. The solicitation is releasable to U.S. Firms only.   The solicitation will require offerors to have access to and/or generate classified information during the preaward phase.   Offerors are required to have a Secret facility security clearance to receive the solicitation package.  Offerors must provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code in order for the Government to verify security clearance prior to release of  the solicitation package.  Offerors must request a copy of the solicitation package in writing to the following address:  Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN:  AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Attn:  Ms. Paulette Wilson), Building 401 Lee Blvd., Ft.

CCRs will replace failing oil-cooled CCRs in 3 older ALSF-2 system critical sites, including JFK where installation and changeover must begin by May 2002.  NPB is the only source for CCRs meeting these requirements (NBP P/Ns 93001096-01 and -02).  NBP P/Ns have already been extensively field tested to demonstrate compliance and compatibility with existing systems and will therefore be available to meet installation schedule.   <P> A one-year extension of an existing contract line item for engineering support services will support potential FAA requirements in calendar year 2004 for engineering, testing, diagnostics and trouble shooting on installed type FA-10700 ALSF-2/SSALR systems with remote maintenance monitoring (RMS).  All type FAA 10700 systems with RMS have been produced by NBP, and that company is the only non-FAA source having detailed technical knowledge of its design and operation. <P>

<DESC>DESC: Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a contract  to the offeror that provides the best value to the government from this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items for services prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as  supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The document number for this Request for Proposals is N62645-02-R-0009 and proposals are due by NOON, 12 April 2002. Responses must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirements. This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-26. NAISC 541611. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract for the following requirement.  This requirement is for analysis services to conduct a Navy Medical Department Organizational Assessment Survey and deliver the associated database (CLIN 0001).  The total contract is for one base year plus two option years to cover FY 02, FY 03 and FY 04.  SCOPE OF WORK:  INTRODUCTION:  The Surgeon General of the United States Navy has tasked the Deputy Assistant Chief for Plans, Analysis and Evaluation to assess morale in the Navy Medical Department.  In support of this, the present study will examine the attitudes and behaviors of individuals in organizational settings.  This can be viewed as the product of three interacting considerations:  (a) perception of the current job situation; (b) future-oriented career considerations; and (c) other aspects of non-work life.  More specifically, the psychological climate of one?s current job situation generally refers to the individual?s cognitively based description of the work situation, psychological processing of specific perceptions into more abstract depictions of the psychologically meaningful influences in the situation, processing of situational characteristics that have direct and immediate ties to individual experiences and applies across a variety of situations (Jones & Jones, 1978).  Variables such as these, when taken together, constitute a form of experienced organizational reality that signal to the individual whether his or her expectations are being (or are likely to be) met.  In addition, they often relate to important organizational outcomes such as absenteeism, productivity, and turnover.  The objectives are to develop and execute a study designed to measure the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors of Navy Medical Department personnel. The present study will also assess retention intention of personnel, job satisfaction, job stress, career needs, work environment stability, and organizational commitment as a function of career stage and occupation.  The survey will be conducted to identify relevant management issues and develop appropriate recommendations.  SCOPE:  The overall scope of this delivery order shall be to provide scientific, technical and professional support to on-going Navy Medical Strategic Goals as described in the following sub-paragraphs.  1.   The purpose of this task is to coordinate the development, production/printing, distribution/mailing, tracking, and completion of questionnaires.  2.  The purpose of this task is to coordinate the receipt of study data, manage the quality, accuracy and timeliness of the data, establishment of data into a data-base, and provide preliminary assistance to the Bureau of Navy Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) research team and various subject matter experts who will be analyzing the data for topic-related outcomes and results.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  1.   The contractor shall provide the BUMED research team with the study questionnaire.  This involves designing the questionnaire, printing and production of the questionnaire, and performing the analyses on the returned written comments from respondents.  2.  The contractor shall assist in the development, production/printing, distribution/mailing, tracking, follow-up/reminders, and completion of the questionnaire.  The contractor shall provide project coordinators with expertise in project management to assist the BUMED research team in accomplishing this work.  3.  The contractor shall perform key-to-disk data entry for all returned questionnaires.  Data is to be double-entered to ensure accuracy.  The final data-base will be no less than 98% accurate.  4.  The contractor shall provide coordination of data collection activities and data-base construction in SPSS 10.0 for Windows.  The data file is to include variable data labels and variable data values.  The coding scheme for these data labels and data values will be coordinated between the contractor and the BUMED research project coordinator.  5.  The contractor shall analyze the responses of two (2) open-ended questions that allow up to three possible responses per question.  These responses will be grouped into content categories based on similar themes.  All responses must be categorized.  Each category will receive a numerical code and be entered into the data-base.  All category codes will be linked to the respondent who provided the responses via a subject identification code.  This subject identification code will appear as the first variable in the data-base.  The numerical category code will appear as the last six variables (e.g., three variables for each of the two open-ended questions) in the data-base.  The first 12 lines (i.e., the actual space provided for respondents? comments on the questionnaire) will be fully transcribed into a text file document.  GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY / MATERIAL:  1. The BUMED research team will provide the contractor with an electronic copy of the questionnaire.  This questionnaire will be provided as a WORD 7.0 file.  The BUMED research team will also provide the contractor with an electronic text file of the business addresses of all research participants. The content and the format of the questionnaire will not be altered in any form without the written consent of the BUMED research team.  2.  100% of the work will be performed at the contractor?s work site.  No U.S. Navy or U.S. Government property will be used in the performance of this statement of work.  Postage, supplies, envelops, return envelopes with the contractor?s address, reminder letters and other necessary supplies incurred by the contractor shall be incorporated into the bid.  3.  The BUMED research will provide the contractor with an electronic copy of the text for the cover letters and the reminder cards.  The BUMED research team will also provide an electronic copy of any emblems that may appear on the cover letters and/or reminder cards.  DATABASE DELIVERABLE:  Must be ?Text Smart?.  TRAVEL:  No travel is required by the contractor for the completion of this project.  SECURITY:  Unclassified  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Contractor will perform 100% of the time at the contractor?s  place of business.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Offeror's shall provide an electronic copy of separate technical and cost proposals via email.  No pricing information shall be contained in the technical proposal. TECHNICAL PROPOSALS shall fully describe the offeror's capability to meet the requirements contained in this synopsis/solicitation. The offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate compliance with all the minimum technical characteristics listed above and contain such additional information as may be necessary for the government to assess technical and performance risk as described below.  In addition to the information in the scope of work stated above, prospective contractors must have 1) a proven track record of a comprehensive range of advanced analytical and data mining expertise; and 2) the breadth and depth of technology and expertise that makes predictive analysis possible and accurate, responsive technological support.  The technical proposal must include a list of no less than two customers for the same or similar services offered herein. Include the name and address of the company/agency, the point of contact with telephone number and the period of performance for that reference.  References may be contacted for evaluation purposes.  COST PROPOSAL shall include a complete price for the requirement in CLIN 0001 with priced option years.  EVALUATION & AWARD: Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal meets the government's minimum requirements and whose price, technical risk and performance risk represents the best value to the government. Technical and performance risk are significantly more important than price. The following technical evaluation criteria will be used:  FACTOR 1: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. The offeror has successfully demonstrated compliance with all of the minimum performance requirements contained in the solicitation. This factor will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE basis.  An offeror may be rated UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED if the proposal has not demonstrated compliance with all minimum requirements but has the potential to do so if amended during discussions.  Offerors are cautioned that the Government intends to award without discussions, so proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED may not be considered for award. Proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE will not be evaluated for Factor 2.  FACTOR 2:  PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT. The extent to which the offeror's proposal reflects an appropriate apportionment of performance risk will be evaluated in this factor. Performance risk considerations are defined as those characteristics of the offeror that give indication of the likelihood of the offeror's successful performance of the current requirement. Their proposed delivery schedule, record of on-time delivery for same services and product, quality of workmanship displayed in same services and product, reliability of same class services and product, business relations exhibited   during previous contracts, range and depth of support provided for same class services and product.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) in conjunction with The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LM) plans to procure a AMT XR-100 CCD Camera system bottom mount with Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation (AMT), 3 Electronics Avenue, Danvers, MA 01923.  The NINDS Electron Microscope (EM) Facility is an Institute-wide facility providing scientists in the DIR with access to state-of-the-art electron microscope equipment.  There are currently two JEOL transmission electron microscopes being used by approximately twenty-five (25) scientists.  The Facility has been generating about 10,000 micrographs a year.   Due to personnel changes, the EM Facility no longer has a photography technician and the backlog photography work is drastically increasing.  The proposed CCD Camera will collect images in digital format, therefore, bypassing the conventional darkroom developing and printing.  Electron micrographs can be printed right after the microscopy session without a waiting period.  The laboratory estimates that more than 90% of the users photography needs will be met by this digital camera.  Also, the CCD Camera will make it possible for projects like serial reconstruction and tomography possible. MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS:  Image Acquisition Interface: 1) Bottom mount configuration; a) 3/4 photographic field of view imaging with 61x61 mm phosphor; b) 24mm square pixels at phosphor; c) custom engineered, high throughput (f/1), low distortion (<1% lens); d) lens resolution as determined by MTF greater than 50% at 100 lb/mm over entire field: 2) 2600x2600 pixel, high definition with; a) scientific grade, progressive scan sensor; b) 12 bit ADC; c) 20 MHz output; d) maximum viewing speed: survey mode (4x4 binning) 6 fps. Focus mode (1x1) 2 fps; e) 2624x2624 square pixel resolution: f) real-time frame integration for up to 16 bit deep recorded images and; g) cooling devices and optics outside the TEM vacuum and immune from contamination.  Digital Image Acquisition Hardware and Software: a) LVDS digital interface for camera data transfer and control; b) graphical user interface designed for good visibility and ease of use; c) automatic and manual gray scale adjustment; d) high precision dark current and gain correction for recorded images and; e) Ulead PhotoImpact software for image enhancement, batch operations and archiving.  The CCD camera offered by Advanced Microscopy Techniques is specifically designed for collecting multiple images in the electron microscope.  The AMT XR-100 CCD camera is specifically designed to work with the JEOL 100 CX and 200 CX interchangeably.  Images collected in the computer running the camera can be directly saved at full resolution and gray scale in TIFF format directly legible in Photoshop running on Apple computer.  The information content of these images will be at least 2600X2600 pixels at 16 bits (>7MB image).  A 61X61mm phosphor detector will give a field of views at least 70% the size of that with 3 1/4 inch film.  Images will be magnified no more that 2 X onto the surface of the phosphor which collects the image.  These camera specifications are all necessary to optimize the collection of EM images over the most commonly used magnification range of the microscope.  The camera can be switched easily from one microscope to another by the operator.  In the past, contamination of the camera chip by vacuum oils has been a problem but, the AMT has designed a camera that, except for collecting phosphor, lies completely outside the vacuum system.  The camera has a fax scan mode that is needed to focus quickly on the specimen before images are collected.  The camera chip is air cooled, therefore no water connections are necessary.  Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation is the only known source to the NINDS research that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington DC time) on April 12, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing to Malinda Holdcraft on electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax, 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, please provide one original and two copies to Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit (DNP) plans to procure an LSM 510 META-NLO  Laser Scanning Microscope system from Carl Zeiss Inc., Once Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.   This Confocal Microscope with 32 channel multi-spectral detector and NLO will be an integral part of a two-photon laser scannning microscope.  The DNP is currently engaged in the study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the mammalian olfactory system.  These studies use expressed fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, dsRed) in the olfactory system and will focus on imaging primary afferents as they converge and form synapses onto the olfactory bulbs.  Since these fluorophores have highly overlapping emission spectra the ability to separate their individual fluorescent signals is critical to the outcome of the experiments.  The ?META-Detector? developed and exclusively available through Carl Zeiss on its LSM 510 is specifically designed to distinguish overlapping emission spectra.  The META uses an optical grating (prism) that separates the emitted light into multiple wavelengths and then detects this light through a 32 channel detector.  The META system is able to discriminate the fluorescence signal produced by fluorophores with widely overlapping emission spectra (i.e. GFP, YFP, FITC).  The system will include a 40mW argon laser (458, 488, and 514) and two helium neon lasers (543nm and 633 nm).  This laser combination provides the excitation wavelengths needed to excite commonly used fluorophores.  The system will include the non-linear optical elements (NLO) essential for coupling a femtosecond laser system (MIRA 900F from Coherent) giving the confocal multi-photon capability.  The system has one META detector and a separate internal conventional PMT detector with independent pinhole as well as two external detectors for 2-photon sensitivity detector.  The system also includes an Acousto Optical Modulator (AOM) which is essential for attenuation and precise wavelength selection of beam from the 2-photon laser system. This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc., is the only organization known to the NINDS researcher that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:30 p.m. EST, on April 4, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendors  responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Rapid Temp Model Box Furnace with inert gas sealed system, power supply and replacement molydisilicide heating element for Box Furnace to be used in the Ames Thermal Protection Laboratory  at NASA Ames Research Center. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase a Rapid Temp Model 1712 GS FL Box Furnace, along with replacement molydisilicide heating element for Rapid Temp Model box furnace, from CM Furnaces, Inc., 103 Dewey Street, Bloomfield, NJ 07003 under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on the fact that the CM Furnaces System has unique features that meet the requirements of the Ames Thermal Protection Laboratory.  The Rapid Temp Model Box Furnace with inert gas sealed system is comprised of 1) Power supply equipped with Eurotherm 2404 microprocessor-based programmable controller and six ramp/soak pairings of 15kW, 208/240 volt and single phase service. 2) Molydisilicide heating elements.  3) Inner chamber size of 13"x11"x12". 4) Maximum Operating Temperature 1700 degrees C.  5) Gas seal on door. High temperatures are required for the processing of advanced thermal protection materials such as new ROCCI, black tile, and UHTC materials.  To achieve adequate control of process temperature, the temperature controller must have at least 6 pairs of ramps and soaks .  ROCCI , a carbon substrate-based material, must be processed in inert gas due to its high tendency to oxidize while either air or oxygen is present.  In order to maintain inert gas inside the furnace for processing samples, the furnace door should have a very good and tight seal around to prevent the oxidation of samples.  Furthermore, the size of the chamber is at least 10 inch x 10 inch x 10.5 inch to accommodate the large sample of actual flightware.    It is critical that the unit purchased has a capacity of heat-treating large samples of materials ( size ranging around and up to 1 ft x 1 ft x 1 ft), a gas seal to process materials in inert gas, in the environment of inert gas and super high temperature with a maximum of 1700 degree C.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on April  11, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Concept Systems Incorporated (CSI), 118 Prospect Street, Suite 309, Ithaca, New York 14850.
CSI will facilitate the translation of surveillance and intervention research evidence so as to promote the adoption of evidence-based community health practices in order to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer outcomes, particularly for underserved communities whose disproportionate cancer burden makes the greatest contribution to cancer-related health disparities.  The Translating Research into Improved Outcomes (TRIO) Initiative has three components: 1) surveillance and modeling, 2) dissemination of evidence-based cancer control interventions, and 3) special partnerships to understand the infrastructure barriers to eliminating cancer-related health disparities in underserved communities.  CSI is the owner and sole licensor of The Concept System software suite which will provide these specific services.  This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention(DCP), Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG), is interested in evaluating inhibitors or potential inhibitors of any stage of carcinogenesis, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents against cancer.  Such agents are to be further evaluated in appropriate toxicological or clinical settings.  The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates detailed criteria for classifying the quantity and quality of information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agents and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent?s experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to evaluate chemopreventive agents In Vivo for inhibition of carcinogenesis.  The object of these studies is to establish the relative efficacies of selected chemopreventive agents in at least one animal model system.  The animal model systems   represent various selected target organs, different species, and different carcinogens.  Those interested in obtaining a copy of this RFP should send their e-mail address to Dorothy M. Coleman at dc93a@nih.gov and a copy of the RFP will be forwarded electronically.  AN AWARD WILL ONLY BE MADE TO A MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDER IN THE IN VIVO MASTER AGREEMENT POOL.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 54171.   Questions should be directed, via facsimile or e-mail to Dorothy M. Coleman, Contracting Officer, Prevention, Control Population Sciences Section, Research Contracts Branch, National Cancer Institute.  Bethesda, MD 20892-7195.    Phone: (301)435-3829; fax: (301)402-8579; e-mail: dc93a@nih.gov .  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Numbered Note 26: Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a sole source modification under contract N00019-01-C-0290 with Rolls Royce Plc., P.O. Box 3, Filton, Bristol, BS12 7QE England, for the procurement of long lead engine parts to support the T-45 F405 Turbofan Engine.  Total scope of the required consumable precision engine parts is based upon a fleet inventory of 175 engines.  Total parts include 188 different part numbers with the quantities ranging from 20 to over 10,000 in the case of certain High Pressure Turbine (HPT), and Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) Blades.  All parts within this requirement must be manufactured to exacting government specification tolerances in order to meet critical pass off criteria derived by the original equipment manufacturer, in this case Rolls Royce, during final engine test cell runs upon completion of engine buildup.  In addition, being the original and sole manufacturer of the F405 series engine, Rolls Royce is the only source with the knowledge and familiarity required to provide needed parts, services, and technical data for the F405.  Data and drawings held by the United States Government are proprietary since the F405 was developed under the United Kingdom/Ministry of Defense procurement guidelines.  As a result, an adequate technical data package for competition does not exist under this arrangement.  See note 22!!

<SUBJECT>65 -- Frameless Stereotaxy System
<SOLNBR>RFQ-NCI-20031-NG

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) in conjunction with The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Human Cortical Physiology Section (HCPS) plans to procure a Brain-sight Frameless Stereotaxy System with Rogue Research, 4398 boul St. Laurent, No. 206, Montreal, QC Canada H2W 1Z5.  The goal of HCPS activity is to understand the mechanisms underlying plastic changes in the human central nervous system and develop novel therapeutic approaches for recovery of function based on these advances.  Most of the laboratories work has focused in plasticity of the human motor system.  More recently, the lab has become interested in the study of plastic changes across sensory modalities (blindness).  HCPS has studies plastic changes in patients with lesions in the central nervous system like hemispherectomy, stroke, and spinal cord injury and in the peripheral nervous system like amputations.  In healthy volunteers, the lab studied plastic changes associated with transient differentiations.  The main technique employed is transcranial magnetic stimulation.  The research protocols are focused in the evaluation of patients with stroke, amputations, and blindness and to the study of plasticity in healthy volunteers. MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS:   A) computer software, Northern Digital Polaris position sensor device; B) probe and required hardware to track TMS coil; C) standard head restraint system and; D) articulated coil holder arm for use in the laboratory.  The purchase of a Brain-sight Frameless Stereotaxy System from Rogue Research will be used in research that involves both MRI, fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation.  It allows for a more precise identification of scalp positions that overly specific cortical regions in each particular human subject.  The TMS magnetic coil is placed much more accurately using this technique. Determination of the most accurate technique to position the magnetic coil over the scalp is crucial for all studies in the HCPS.  Until recently this has been done using a relatively crude procedure based on the 10-20 scalp electrode placement coordinate system (used in EEG studies), a best-guess estimate based on skull landmarks, or based on a hit and miss localization procedure that depend on interfering or facilitating a response for example, finger movement.  Frameless stereotaxy allows for a significant advance in accuracy to position a coil over the scalp in relation to cortical landmarks in each individual.  The frameless stereotaxic system acquisition is completely compatible with the existing government owned computer and transcranial magnetic stimulators in our laboratories.  The following are the frameless stereotaxic system enhancement features: 1) ability to register the real world and volumetric image data; 2) track pointers and tools in real time; 3) annotations can be dropped at pointer defined locations; 4) annotation locations available in image coordinate space; 5) provides the ability to link the physical world to the image world using external tracking devices and; 6) ability to use image information to guide the positioning of various instruments in physical space or can obtain the position of physical objects in image space.  Rogue Research is the only known source to the NINDS research that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington DC time) on April 12, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing to Malinda Holdcraft on electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax, 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, please provide one original and two copies to Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE.

Offerors will have    5    minutes after the DPE goes into the "Quiet Period" status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notificat ion of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

As a plan to expand plant production, product offerings and meet market demands, Codilait would like to replace its manual can production line with an automated line as part of its efforts to produce cans for milk operations, as well as supply cans for Cameroon's growing market for canned juices, fruits and vegetables.

     The Terms of Reference for each distinct, but related feasibility study is similar in requiring the U.S. firm to undertake the following tasks:

1)	Review of strategy.
2)	Financial assessment of current balance sheets and inventory.
3)	Market assessment.
4)	Financial analysis of long-term demand.
5)	Technical design, including specifications for U.S. supplied equipment.
6)	Siting of facilities, explore environmental factors.
7)	Determine structuring of implementation financing.
8)	Determine project implementation schedule.
9)	Final Report. 

     The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $172,500 grant to each Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). [$345,000 in total]

Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

<DESC>03/28/2002 DESC:  The purpose of this modification synopsis is to make clarifications to synopsis W-270 SN50Z071 dated 27 September 2001, which remains in full force and effect, except for the changes noted herein:  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR)  makes the following changes to synopsis W-270 SN50Z071. (1) The requirement for a prototype in Phase I is deleted and Phase I now consists of risk reduction and the development of the system specification and other documents for Phase II. (2)  Phase II Options will consist of cost plus award fee, cost plus fixed fee and a firm fixed priced line item for data rights. (3) Sustainment of the DIMHRS system will be available, via annual options, through 2011.  All information on this procurement will be posted on the Business Opportunities webpage. __________________________________________ 03/28/2002 The DIMHRS requirement was originally synopsized on the Commerce Business Daily (CBDNet), synopsis number W-270 SN50Z071 dated 27 September 2001. __________________________________________ The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to competitively award a contract for the Development and Implementation component of the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS).  DIMHRS, as fielded, will provide Personnel and Pay (Pers/Pay) services for Department of Defense (DoD) Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard service members worldwide as well as personnel and pay support throughout the life cycle of a Service member's career.  DIMHRS will provide support across the full operational spectrum; peacetime and war, through mobilization and demobilization, deployment and redeployment.  The DIMHRS System will collect data on every aspect of the Service member's career.  It will retain and maintain that data in a single, comprehensive record of service that will be available to the Service member.  The data must be accessible by the Service personnel chiefs, CINCs, military personnel and pay managers, and authorized users in OSD and other Federal Agencies. Through the use of Business process reengineering the DIMHRS Program will continue to accommodate changes to both policy requirements and processes within the personnel and pay functional arena for the life of the system. It is the government's intent to implement DIMHRS Pers/Pay utilizing the previously awarded DOD enterprise software license for the Human Resource (HR) components of PeopleSoft Version 8. The full and open competition and subsequent down-select will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be a full and open competition between all interested parties.  The Government intends to award up to three firm fixed priced contracts.  Each of these contracts will contain fixed priced options for the of Development and Implementation component.  In the second phase, the three selected contractors will build their prototype based on their proposed technical solution set. The working prototype will consist of a core PeopleSoft Version 8 HRMS functionality applied to the DoD Personnel and pay environment. Each contractor's proposal and prototypes will be evaluated to determine the best value for the Government. This down-selection process will leave one contractor to develop and sustain the system over the life of the contract. The Government will be holding an Industry Day on October 15, 2001 in New Orleans, LA at University of New Orleans campus on Elysian Fields. Face-to-face meetings will be scheduled between October 16-19, 2001 with interested Contractor's and their team members. Face-to-face meetings must be scheduled in advance. Call Moira Eiserloh at 504-697-4534 by close of business October 10, 2001 to schedule a time to meet with the Government team.  For more information on the Industry Day, Meetings and procurement package, review and monitor the SPAWAR Business Opportunities webpage.  All information on this procurement will be posted on the Business Opportunities webpage.

<DESC>NA This is Amendment 0004 to the previous Combined Synopsis/Solicitation (CSS) Number DATM07-02-R-0007 for Commercial Items posted on 19-March-2002.  The purpose of the amendment is to answer the following Technical Questions.   Q-1.  There are many different types of dust covers, do you want the dust cover for the connector end only (to cover the ferrule, the cap) or a box cover, explain? A-1.  The self-closing dust cover is of a type that attaches to the end of the receptacle once the receptacle is inserted into the fiber termination box and is held in place with a lock washer.  The self-closing dust cover has a spring mechanism that will hold the cover and seal tightly against the receptacle when not in use, preventing dust and dirt to enter into the receptacle.  The cover rests against the plug-to-plug assembly (due to the tension provided by the spring mechanism. Q-2.  Pigtail, in the fiber optic world usually means a piece of cable connectorized on one end only.  The end without the connectors gets spliced to another piece of cable, is this then a true pigtail? A-2.  No, it is not a “true pigtail”.  One end has sc/upc single mode connectors (simplex) and the other end has a tactical type connector (refer to Cannon Part #F0111400-4033). Q-3.  Is the shutter latch on the connector or the SC coupling?  There is a commercial version of this type of product available from a company called Molex.  When the male SC connector is removed from the coupling a latch with a spring automatically close s keeping dust out. A-3.  The self-closing dust cover is on the tactical type connector (refer to Cannon Part #F0111400-4033). Q-4.  SC connectors in the commercial market are single or duplex units.  Are we talking about the same thing here or is there a custom made SC multifiber connector? A-4.  The tactical type connector has 12 fibers (25” long) coming from it, which terminate in simplex sc/upc single mode connectors. The amendment also adds the following FAR Clause to 52.212-5-Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items:  52.223-9-Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA-Designated Products (Aug 00).  This will be the final amendment for this solicitation.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Metalite Aviation Lighting on a sole source basis for an Expeditionary Airfield Lighting Cable Kit (CABKIT), which will be a means of distributing power to all edge lights installed at an Expeditionary Airfield, allowing continuous support of both runway and taxiway operations.  A maximum quantity of 46 CABKITS will be procured under an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract. Various spare parts will also be procurred. The USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Program provides airfield lighting support to a myriad of airfield scenarios, such as remote landing zones, minimum operating strips, bi-directional runways with or without taxiways, and emergency back-up to permanently installed systems.  Currently, the USMC is utilizing the Expeditionary Airfield Minimum Operating Strip Lighting System (MOSLS).  MOSLS is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system designed, manufactured and supplied by Metalite Aviation Lighting located in Birmingham, United Kingdom.  The two prime subsystems of MOSLS, the Minimum Operating Strip Lighting Kit (MOSKIT), Metalite PN S1N105017, and the Supplemental Airfield Lighting Kit, (SALKIT), Metalite PN S1N105016 both utilize the Omni-directional Runway Edge Light (OREL), Metalite PN S1N105168, as a core sub-element.  Each OREL is capable of operating from either its self-contained batteries or an external alternating current (AC) power source.  The CABKIT shall not contain its own power supply (e.g. generator), but shall be capable of distributing the proper AC power to the ORELs when connected to a variety of external power sources, to include the onboard MOSKIT generators.  The CABKIT must be completely compatible with the MOSKIT and SALKIT.  The Government does not own any engineering drawings or data rights for the MOSKIT, SALKIT, or their sub-components to include the OREL, and therefore cannot provide sufficient interface information to competitively procure the CABKIT.  Metalite Aviation Lighting, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), is the only company capable of providing the CABKIT.  A single CABKIT system shall be capable of supporting 356 ORELs, and consist of the smallest quantity possible of similar packages, each configured within an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Quadruple Container (QUADCON) shipping container.  Any single CABKIT package must possess, at a minimum, all of the capabilities to support 36 ORELs, each located 500 feet apart.  The remaining support shall be for 320 ORELs spaced 250 feet apart.  Each individual CABKIT package shall be self-sufficient for the number of ORELs it is to support.  For example, if a CABKIT is to support 100 ORELs, it must contain at a minimum, 100 interconnecting cables, 100 mating connectors (if applicable), 100 junction boxes (as applicable) etc.  An additional 500 feet of cable shall be provided with each CABKIT system in order to connect the first light to the circuit.  Cable reels shall be stowed within the CABKIT containers with the capacity of being removed or stowed by no more than two Marines.  In addition, the CABKIT shall contain a minimum of one portable cable reel stand to aid in the deployment and recovery of cables.  The CABKIT will be inspected and accepted at Source, and shipped F.O.B. origin (shipping arranged by the Government) to  Lakehurst, NJ.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by 10 April 2002. Responses should reference N68335-02-R-3047.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<SOLNBR>DASG60-02-R-0008
<RESPDATE>032802
<ARCHDATE>04272002
<CONTACT>Warren Potter, 301-619-2383
<DESC>NA The following questions and answers are provided for information only.  They are not intended to change any of the requirements for offorer provided information in response to Phase 1 of subject Synopsis.  Therefore, the Phase 1 Offeror Response date remai ns March 28, 2002. Question 1: As part of the requirement for the consideration of the subject solicitation, is the government providing antibody reagents against the biological agents?  Answer 1: The Government will provide reagent source material to the successful JBAIDS o fferor.  If the offeror is using protein antibody technology to identify the Government's JBAIDS' BW agents of interest, antibody source materials will be provided.  It is the contractor's responsibility to take this material and incorporate this material into the JBAIDS' reagent kits' design effort.  The design and performance of the reagent kit for each agent of interest will be demonstrated in the fly off phase of the program, during the development program, and in production.  Please note JBAIDS' system  performance in the areas of specificity and sensitivity remains the contractor's responsibility.  Also, a contractor has the latitude to not to use the DoD CRP antibody material, if the contractor believes better antibodies are available from other source s.  However, no JBAIDS' schedule relief will be provided during the fly off, development phase, or in production for lack of antibody source material.  Question 2: Is it required of the offeror to have sourced materials and reagents in a development phase for submission of Phase 1?  Answer 2: There is no requirement for the offeror to have antibody source material in development for submission of JBAIDS' Phase I source selection information.  Question 3: Is the CRP supporting the JBAIDS project with the spe cific reagents necessary for production?  Answer 3: The CRP program will provide specific source material only. Again, the contractor has the latitude not to use the DoD CRP antibody material if the contractor believes better antibodies are available from other sources.  However, no JBAIDS' schedule relief will be provided during the fly off, development phase, or in production for lack of antibody source material.  Question 4: Is the information submitted in proposals viewed as confidential or is it access ible for general consumption?  Answer 4: Before award, your proposal is not shared with anyone, except those approved to evaluate it for purposes of award.  If you receive an award, your proposal then would be subject to release under the Freedom of Inform ation Act, but only if it is specifically requested by someone, and only then if does not contain ‘proprietary information.’  If you feel your proposal contains things you do not want revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, marking it ‘proprietary’ would be an effective way of signaling your concerns to the government contracting staff, who, regardless of a ‘proprietary’ marking, would notify and consult you whenever anyone requested a copy of your proposal.  Question 5: Can the proposal be submitted  on March 28, 2002 or should it be submitted before March 28, 2002?  Answer 5: The offeror’s response to Phase 1 of subject synopsis must be received either by conventional mail/delivery services or electronically to the email address provided in the synop sis by (meaning on or before) March 28, 2002.  Question 6: In Phase I, to support the screening criterion 1 is it necessary to provide complete list of data to demonstrate that ‘prospective offeror has available for Government inspection Supporting Test Da ta for Performance Claims’ or it will be satisfactory to provide the Performance Claims only? Answer 6: Subject synopsis provides that ‘The initial Government screening process for JBAIDS will require perspective contractors to adequately describe and prov ide documentation as to how they will be able to produce and deliver within a period of 7 months the initial systems. Your description and d ocumentation must demonstrate the prospective offeror’s ability to meet all of the initial screening criteria’.  The description and documentation chosen by your company to demonstrate your ability to meet the criteria that ‘Prospective offeror has possess ion of a System Science/Methodology to Identify BW Agent/Toxin Agents/Pathogens and has available for Government inspection Supporting Test Data for Performance Claims’ may (in your Phase 1 submission) include a listing or general description of test data that is available for Government inspection.  The actual test data is not required as a part of the Phase 1 submission.  Question 7: How many test kits are envisioned to be delivered 7-8 month ACA?  Answer 7: That information will be provided as a part of the Phase 3 purchase order package.  Question 8: What is the envisioned duration of Block I project? Answer 8: FY02 to FY07.

<DESC>The FAA intends to negotiate a modification to existing contract number DTFA01-01-C-00055 with New Bedford Panoramex Corporation (NBP), Upland, CA, for a quantity of 8 ferro-resonant constant current regulators (CCRs) compatible with FAA Type FA-10721 and FA-10723 systems and a one-year extension of engineering support service for ALSF-2/SSALR systems (FA-10700) with a new ceiling amount of $284,000 during a four-year period (2001 - 2004).   <P> CCRs must be air-cooled, 50 KW, with an electrical status interface to allow the ALSF-2 control and monitor cabinet to monitor system brightness at levels B1 through B5.  CCRs will replace failing oil-cooled CCRs in 3 older ALSF-2 system critical sites, including JFK where installation and changeover must begin by May 2002.  NPB is the only source for CCRs meeting these requirements (NBP P/Ns 93001096-01 and -02).  NBP P/Ns have already been extensively field tested to prove compliance and compatibility with existing systems and will therefore be available to meet installation schedule.   <P> A one-year extension of an existing contract line item for engineering support services will support potential FAA requirements in calendar year 2004 for engineering, testing, diagnostics and troubleshooting on installed type FA-10700 ALSF-2/SSALR systems with remote maintenance monitoring (RMS).  All type FAA 10700 systems with RMS have been produced by NBP, and that company is the only non-FAA source having detailed technical knowledge of its design and operation. <P>

<DESC>NA CHEMICAL PATIENT WRAP SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT Classification Code: 84 – Clothing and Individual Equipment Subject: MIL-C-44313 (GL), Cover, Chemical Protective, Patient Wrap The USA Robert Morris Acquisition Center-Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Natick Soldier Center is conducting a market investigation to identify alternate materials for the patien t wrap.  Design of the patient wrap will remain essentially the same as the current patient wrap with only minor modifications to update port areas and closures.  The program will leverage mature fabric technologies suitable for the three components of the  patient wrap system.  The Chemical Protective, Patient Wrap describes a chemical agent protective system to protect uncontaminated/decontaminated litter patients from chemical agent exposure during movement through a contaminated area from a treatment sta tion to more definitive care.  Three main material components make up the current patient wrap system.  The ground cloth is a three layer laminate described by MIL-C-44304 (Cloth, Coated:  Cloth, Laminated, Chemical Protective).    The top layer of materia l is a breathable laminate described by MIL-C-44303 (Cloth, Porous, Laminated System) and the window material is described by MIL-C-44305 (Plastic Film, Flexible, Polyamide and Polyethylene).   Material Qualification Requirements:  Each type of candidate material (ground cloth, window, or permeable top sheet) will be tested by the methods below and must pass the requirements in tables below.   All candidate materials must pass a skin toxicity ev aluation by the Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM).   GROUND SHEET:  Material must be totally impervious to moisture of any kind including liquid chemical agents and must meet the requirements in the table below.  For use in the patient wrap the color on both sides of the material will be required to approxim ate Camouflage Green 483 (color chip #34094 of FED-STD-595).

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high humidity, reduce d snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(5) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.  Group B, Activ e Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) Integrated Pointer/Illuminator Module (IPIM), (3) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (4) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) IPIM: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance/reflectivity of visible lasers against green and black targets, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the IPIM have expired.  T he SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.   B(3) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(4) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired. The SOPMOD Program desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines th is capability into a unified system, such as IPIM above. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives: (1) increased User Acceptance to include: improved operational suitability, improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

<SUBJECT>U -- Questions and Answers to Role-Playing/Video Taping Services Solicitation
<DESC>1) After the video has been shot, will there be any video editing necessary? Yes. 2) If the videos need to be edited, how polished of a product is the USSS looking for? A standard editing job. 3) Is there any need for graphics, music, or multiple angles? Possibly. 4) Is there a tape format that is preferred (i.e., Beta SP vs DV)? It does not matter. 5) Will more than one camera angle of coverage be necessary (i.e., Two camera's taping at the same time)? Possibly at times two. 6) And just to clarify, will the exercises be taped in their entirety and not be interrupted in any way by our camera crew? Yes, no camera interruptions. 7) If there is an exercise at night will lighting be necessary, or will a camera-mounted light be sufficient? If not, are the lighting related expenses billable which can be quite significant? Camera mount light will be sufficient. 8) The contract states that all props are billable to the USSS. Does a rented car qualify as a prop? Absolutely not. They must be able to supply their own vehicle and we will pay for mileage and gas (per Government Travel Rates - as stated in the Statement of Work). 9) It states in the contract that the role-players must be briefed on JJRTC rules. How does the contractor become familiar with these rules? Are they available? There will obviously be a briefing to kick off the contract in the beginning at the start. Those rules then can be transferred to the role-players via employee orientation by the company supervisor. 10) In terms of furnishing the past 3 years of contracts - my company has done possibly hundreds of video jobs over the past 3 years. Does a contract relate to a single job or only when we are contracted over an extended period of time? A contract has a value of $100,000.00 or more. 11) Is the total hours listed in the contract only shooting hours? Or does this include video editing? It includes both shooting and editing (in total hours). 12) Will there be any situations where there are multiple training exercises taking place at the same time which would require an additional camera crew? Yes, there will be times when there are a multitude of exercises on campus. 13) Is there an incumbent and are they bidding this proposal? There is no current contract of this magnitude for these services. However, the USSS has issued simplified acquisitions for similar services in the past. 14) Is OT based on a 10 hour or 8 hour workday? Please refer to page 5 of the solicitation. 15) Does the Government prefer union or non-union talent? The Government does not have a preference provided that the talent is qualified to do the job. 16) What is the ratio of indoor to outdoor shooting? A rough guess is OK. Outdoor shooting would be about 40 percent and indoor shooting would be 60 percent. 17) Is the project manager required to establish his/her offices at JJRTC? Yes, but does not have to be present all of the time. 18) If on an on-call basis, how far can the supervisor be away from JJRTC? This supervisor would just have to keep a role call sheet, other role-players' names and contacts, and a beeper and/or cell phone to be able to replace a role-player at the last minute, etc. 19) Does the contractor have creative control over the scenarios? No. 20) If it is decided that two cameras will be used, will it be possible to bill the USSS the "price per hour for video taping" multiplied by two? Yes, the price per hour for video taping pertains to each camera being used.

<SUBJECT>B -- Trade Studies and Tactics Development  for CV-22
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement intends to extend existing contract USZA22-98-D-0001 with the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office for FY03, FY04, FY05, FY06, and FY07.  The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps.  Bell Helicopter and Boeing Space and Missile Defense Systems, Helicopter Division were competitively selected to jointly develop and produce the V-22 and its variants.  The Department of the Navy is funding the R&D costs for the CV-22 up to an agreed to ceiling.  USSOCOM is funding the remaining capabilities needed to meet the Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for SOF requirements.  The CV-22 program often involves making a choice between competing functional systems being developed for other aircraft platforms.  The selected system must then be integrated into the CV-22 design, tested, incorporated in production planning/retrofit, and supported by the CV-22 logistical concept.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that Bell-Boeing  is the only source capable of evaluating candidate solutions against the evolving CV-22 development baseline as it progresses from Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review (CDR) and production decision in FY 05. In order to ensure that needed CV-22 performance capabilities are available to meet SOF operator requirements, detailed trade studies and analysis must be accomplished well in advance of the production program.  Therefore, it is imperative that USSOCOM have the capability of contracting with Bell-Boeing, the sole developer of the CV-22 system, to conduct trade studies and analysis of baseline /advanced CV-22 systems/sub-systems. This  contract will also continue a tactical simulation effort begun in FY97 and enhance its operational realism and functionality.  The tactical simulation support allows AFSOC aircrews to develop tactics to employ the CV-22 aircraft on SOF missions.  The hybrid characteristics of the CV-22 (hover like a helicopter/fly like a fixed wing airplane) provide the user with new capabilities and approaches to execute mission scenarios.  The SOF mission differs greatly from the USMC generic ship-to-shore mission.  The long range, clandestine, infiltration/exfiltration mission accomplished in adverse weather under a single period of darkness requires specific tactics to ensure aircraft survivability and mission success.  These tactics need to be developed and validated so crews can be trained and mission capable when CV-22 operational aircraft are delivered.  Based on current force structure planning, there will not be an overlap between current aircraft platforms and CV-22.  When these aircraft are delivered, they will be deployed operationally with a high projected operations tempo. The contractor has already   developed a simulator that replicates CV-22 functionality planned for the aircraft.  The simulator will be upgraded by the contractor to incorporate a new visual system to improve its fidelity.  The simulator will include  an operationally realistic environment that will allow aircrews to adequately assess the functionality of the CV-22 design.  A full fidelity simulation exercise to check out high-risk items was completed in Sep 97 as part of the CV-22 Crew Systems development and the program successfully completed the Crew Systems CDR in Oct 97.  A preplanned product improvement (P3I) program which will integrate USSOCOM special operations forces (SOF) unique capabilities in the CV-22 (a SOF variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps).  No solicitation will be issued.  The basic requirement was synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily on November 25, 1997, and updated on December 23, 1997.  The P3I Program was synopsized on February 1, 1999.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Jacqueline (Jackie) Foreid-Germain, foreidj@socom.mil, fax (813)828-7504.   See numbered note 22.
