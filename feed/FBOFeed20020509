<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for an Integrated Imaging Multi-Spectral Sensor System (IIMSSS), on a sole source basis to Pacific Advanced Technology, Inc. (PAT) of Santa Ynez, CA. The system will provide an integrated system environment for a single user to collect hyper-spectral data cubes from 0.4 micro meters to 14 micro meters. To accomplish this, integration of existing NRL owned IMSS sensors with additional IMSS sensor bands will be necessary. This includes integrating 4 cameras and their lenses into a single data acquisition system to collect simultaneous hyper-spectral data-cubes across the visual, near IR, mid wave IR, and long wave IR. It is essential that software, hardware and firmware for each of the sub-bands all interface and integrate with one another.  The Imaging Multi-Spectral Sensor (IMSS) concept is held under US patents, based on commercial work, owned by Pacific Advanced Technology, Inc (PAT) of Santa Ynez, Calif.  Hence the only company having this type of sensing device available for procurement is PAT, Inc. The NRL/STO currently owns two sub-pieces of the needed IIMSSS, both produced by PAT. These are the 3-5 micro meter and 8-11 micro meter sub-band IMSS systems, which consist of an IMSS lens and IR camera for these sub-bands.  The software, firmware, and hardware to interface with these IMSS lenses are proprietary to PAT.  No solicitation will be issued in response to this solicitation.   Note 26 applies.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 14-3K47-02, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  The NAICS code is 541380, with a  size standard of 6.0 million.   This acquisition will be procured on an unrestricted basis.  The Government intends to negotiate sole source with Invitrogen Life Technologies, 1600 Faraday Ave., Carlsbad, CA  92008, pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.  The Government will award a firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Fax quotations are acceptable to T.C. Mitchell at 301/504-0333 on or before May 24, 2002 by 4 p.m. (EST). Quotes may also be mailed or hand delivered to the Contracting Address by 5-24-2002.  This RFQ is for cDNA library normalization service to construct a normalized cDNA library from bovine small intestinal tissue.  A normalized cDNA library of low clonal redundancy is required as a resource by our laboratory to efficiently generate 10,000 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the bovine small intestine.  This service needs to follow specific parameters to insure our lab obtains the highest quality cDNA library necessary for our EST project.  First, mRNA has to be isolated from up to five unique small intestinal tissue samples.  The mRNA must be mixed in equimolar concentrations before producing >1 kb cDNA fragments with a high fidelity enzyme like SuperScript II H-Rnase reverse transcriptase.  We require these cDNAs fragments be cloned into pCMV Sport 6.0 vector and transformed into DH10B cells.  From these reactions, two libraries should be produced; each with >1 x 10 to the 7th power primary clones.  Individual clones from these libraries need to be analyzed to determined average cDNA insert size.  The primary libraries have to be produced in a 4 to 6 week time frame following procurement of tissue samples.  A hundred clones are then returned to our laboratory for sequence analysis to determine redundant clones for quality control analysis of the normalization procedure.  The primary libraries are amplified using a semi-solid agarose procedure to minimize clonal bias that would occur in a liquid amplification.  The libraries should be amplified 10- 100,000 fold.  Once amplified, the DNA isolated from the libraries should undergo a Cot-500 normalization using subtractive hybridization technology.  The DNA is again transformed into E. coli to produce a final copy of the normalized Completion of the normalized library from the primary libraries has to be done in 4-6 weeks.  The resultant normalized library should have reduced abundant genes by 10-100 fold.  Levels of ribosomal RNA clones also need to be determined by colony hybridization.  All steps used to produce this cDNA must be assured by a quality control process.  All residual materials need to be returned to our laboratory.  Job completion time is 4 months after notice to proceed. The following FAR clauses and provisions apply and are available on http://www-far.npr.gov or http://arnet.gov/far : FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Award to technically acceptable offeror, at a fair and reasonable price; The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: in order of importance 1.

Such analysis shall focus on, but is not limited to, the following nine (9) radio programming areas:  Design of the MERN's overall cross-cultural music, entertainment, news, and features programming; (2) Use of "Powergold" music programming software to maximize the effectiveness of mixed Western and non-Western (Arabic) music, interfacing Powergold with computerized automation software (i.e., IDAPS); (3) Developing innovative methods for integrating and networking the MERN Pan-Arabic stream with other streams targeted at specific Middle East areas and audiences; (4) Music research, including interfacing with research companies selected by the BBG to recommend parameters for testing, interpretation of research results, and implementation of specific programming techniques based on the research results; (5) Branding (i.e. applying American radio programming expertise to such areas as sectioning of station and program names, positioning slogans, and promotional spots for music, news, and public affairs programming); (6) Marketing, including station launch strategies, publicity techniques, and applying American and cross-cultural radio techniques to develop effective new ways of interacting with the Middle East target youth audience both on and off the air; (7) Broadcast operations, including application of American radio techniques to MERN radio station staffing, internal organization, and planning using Microsoft software; (8) Training MEPC personnel in American commercial radio broadcasting techniques; and (9) Developing innovative methods for achieving MERN's public diplomacy objectives in ways that are attractive to the Middle East target youth audience.  The contract "deliverables", resulting from the contractor's specialized "advisory and Assistance" services and analysis work, shall consist of the following tangible end-products to be provided by the contractor to the BBG's MERN-PO: (a)  A complete set of written "design parameters", and in some cases as determined by the MERN-PO, the actual design of MERN's overall cross-cultural music, entertainment, news, and features programming and/or specified elements of such programming; (b) Performance of day-to-day coordination and interaction with, and technical and business support of, the MERN-PO and MEPC staffs, primarily in Washington, DC, but as necessary on-site throughout the Middle East region as determined by the MERN-PO, and including active participation in BBG, MERN-PO, and MEPC meetings pertaining to the nine above-stated MERN programming areas; and (c)  Submission of written quarterly reports to the MERN-PO on the progress and problems observed by the contractor during the overall development and implementation of the MERN programming effort, including specific recommendations to the MERN-PO and/or MEPC for the solution ofidentified problems and/or improvements to the overall development and implementation of the MERN programming effort.  These quarterly reports shall include, but are not limited to, the contractor's specific comments and recommendations on the technical, research, personnel staffing, and budgeting aspects of the overall MERN programming effort.  Because of the specialized nature (i.e., special technical, cultural, logistical, business, and political considerations) and the necessary timeliness of the contractor's performance of the above-stated "advisory and assistance" services in support of the BBG's MERN-PO and MEPC during their development and implementation of the MERN programming effort, the BBG intends to non-competitively award a negotiated firm-fixed-price contract to Bert Kleinman Programming, Inc. (BKP) of Pacific Palisades, CA for this specialized work on the basis of BKP's unique technical qualifications and direct pertinent and current experience in Middle East radio programming for Arabic youth audiences, and BKP's known capability to meet the BBG's overall time schedule for the MERN programming effort.  BKP is the only responsible source known to the BBG that has demonstrated in-depth specialized technical knowledge and current experience with Arabic youth audience programming that is critical to the contractor's ability the perform the above-summarized work in a high quality and timely manner that is critical to making the MERN an effective broadcasting network.  Such unique BKP capability is due, in part, to BKP's experience in dealing with Middle East region programming development and implementation issues with the appropriate Ministries of Information and/or Communications in several important countries of the Middle East region.  The Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this proposed procurement is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2), 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(l), which states: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."  This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively procure BKP's advisory and assistance services is NOT a request for competitive price quotations or proposals.  However, other interested firms or individuals may express to the U.S. Government their interest in and capability to perform the above-stated specialized advisory and assistance services.  Any such written expressions of interest AND statements of capabilities must be received by the Government Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of publication of this Public Notice in order to be considered.  Oral or incomplete submissions will not be accepted by the Government.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement, based upon any responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

REFERENCE: USAID/HONDURAS SOLICITATION NO. 522-02-022 NON-PSC 
CHIEF- ENGINEER POSITION FOR HONDURAS
SALARY RANGE BEGINNING AT: $75,000

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Honduras (USAID/Honduras) is seeking applications (Optional Form 612, Standard Form 171, or Resume) for a Personal Service Contractor (NON-PSC) of a U.S. Chief-Engineer for the Municipal Infraestructure Rehabilitation and Constructiong through FHIS in Honduras.  Submissions shall be in accordance with Scope of Work herewith to the following address:
Office of Contract Management, USAID/Honduras, Unit 2927, APO AA 34022 or by fax no. 011 (504) 236-7776.

SCOPE OF WORK
U. S.  Engineer ("Chief Engineer")
FHIS Executing Unit Municipal Development Activity
										
Background: Municipal Development Activity

Devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in late-October 1998, and the associated flooding which continued through January 1999, resulted in the deaths of thousands of Hondurans, left nearly a million people temporarily homeless and caused incalculable crop, equipment, and infrastructure damage. The impact on water, drainage, and sanitation systems in Honduras was particularly severe.

The Municipal Development Activity (MDA INFRASTRUCTURE) of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program is supporting the construction of works related with the repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of water, drainage, sewerage and landfill systems damaged by Hurricane Mitch as well as the establishment of new systems in sites where families displaced by the hurricane have been relocated.

It is expected that approximately 30 municipalities will benefit from major repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of their basic water, drainage and sanitation systems.  Design and construction of the systems will be contracted by the FHIS Executing Unit in close collaboration with municipal governments.

Expected results include: 1) rehabilitation and expansion of approximately 24 urban water supply and 27 urban sanitation systems that will be operated by municipal governments; 2) construction of eight new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations; and 3) comprehensive storm drainage systems constructed in five secondary cities. 

Private sectors firms will be contracted to execute reconstruction and regular assistance activities; day-to-day supervision will be provided primarily by individual contract consulting engineers and supervisors.  An estimated 20 firms are expected to be involved, including contractors and supervisory firms.

FHIS Executing Unit

The implementation of these construction projects had originally been undertaken by the Directorate for Major Infrastructure (DIM) of the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS).  Under the direction of the DIM/FHIS, approximately 12 water systems, 15 sanitation systems, 5 new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations, and 3 drainage systems have been contracted and completed for a value of US$40 million.  In an effort to improve the timely contracting and execution of the remainder of the water and sanitation systems (with an expected cost of US$30 million), implementation responsibilities have been transferred to an executing unit within FHIS ("FHIS Executing Unit").  This executing unit has been given the necessary authority to contract the remaining water and sanitation construction, and manage existing construction contracts within the established timeframe.  Under the direction of its U.S. citizen Manager (the "Manager"), the FHIS Execution Unit, which responds directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee is the entity responsible for the tendering process, supervision of construction contracts, and completion of the established objectives.

A similar executing unit was established to contract and build the roads and bridges activities of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program.  Through approximately May 31, 2002, this executing unit will be responsible for closing out the roads and bridges component while assuming responsibility for the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  On or about June 1, 2002, the FHIS Executing Unit will be solely responsible for the implementation of the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.

This executing unit is unique because of its special authority to manage and execute construction contracts.  It is a unit entirely within the supervision of the Minister of FHIS, but is also unique in that all staff, both U.S. and Honduran nationals, are contracted with USAID program funds (i.e., MDA INFRASTRUCTURE funds).

Headed by a U.S. citizen Manager, the FHIS Executing Unit will be comprised of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE-financed Honduran staff to implement the contracting, field supervision, financial administration, and concurrent auditing activities.  A U. S. citizen will also be contracted for the position of Chief Engineer and will serve as the FHIS Executing Unit's chief technical, scientific and engineering expert.  Under the supervision of the Manager, the Chief Engineer will insure that the FHIS Executing Unit inspects, measures and monitors all construction activities and provides regular assistance to assure contract compliance and adherence to acceptable engineering practices; that the engineering staff are effecting proper technical oversight and payment certifications; and that they are dedicating approximately 60% of their time to field inspections during both design and contract implementation phases. To facilitate the engineering oversight, the Manager, with input from the Chief Engineer, will develop standard formats for supervision record keeping and maintenance of daily staff activity and travel records.

The remainder of FHIS Executing Unit staff will include approximately xx senior Honduran water and sanitation engineer experts, xx middle-level Honduran field engineers, two contracts specialist engineer, xx financial officer, and a complement of administrative and support staff.  The FHIS Executing Unit will also include a two-person Internal Concurrent Audit Team (CAT), which unlike the rest of the staff, will report directly to the FHIS Controllers and USAID controllers.

Role of Chief Engineer

The Chief Engineer is the chief technical, scientific and quality-control officer for the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  He/she shall be a senior, widely experienced and recognized water, drainage and sanitation engineering expert with the independent technical judgment and initiative necessary to exercise technical authority to insure the long-term success of the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  He/she is responsible to assure adherence to the technical terms and conditions of the descriptions of the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE as stated in the agreements, amendments and implementation letters (which may be amended from time to time), and of individual construction and supervisory contracts.  He/she will conduct sustained, vigorous, hands-on management of all technical elements, and is expected to dedicate approximately 40% of his/her time to field and site visits.  The Chief Engineer will be a vigorous, pro-active advocate and control officer who ensures that the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE's ambitious technical objectives are met in a transparent and cost-effective manner.  Responsibility for the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE's technical success resides in the Chief Engineer.  The Chief Engineer will report directly to the Manger and, if required, will act in place of the Manager in the latter's absence.

The Chief Engineer should be sufficiently familiar not only with the science and engineering of water, drainage and sanitation solutions, but equally as important, should be familiar with the application of appropriate technologies and standards in a Central American or developing world context.  The Chief Engineer will apply his/her technical and scientific knowledge to guide and integrate the results of scientific studies and designs towards reasonably cost-effective systems.  These water, drainage and sanitation systems should not only be operational within the local context, but should demonstrate a reduced susceptibility to future disasters.
 
The Chief Engineer will: 

- Oversee all technical, scientific and engineering functions of FHIS Executing Unit personnel, contractors, consulting engineers and supervisors.

- Insure that the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE's technical objectives are provided for in a cost-effective manner in all specifications and designs and assure through aggressive oversight that MDA INFRASTRUCTURE contractors effectively comply with these specifications and designs.

- Supervise the technical activities of (a) FHIS Executing Unit staff, including approximately xx senior Honduran engineer experts, and xx middle-level Honduran engineers; and (b) contract firms and consulting engineers/supervisors.  The Chief Engineer will design and conduct training and seminar sessions as required to achieve uniformly durable results.

- During the design phase, visit all sites where MDA INFRASTRUCTURE-financed systems will be constructed. 

- Participate actively in the proceedings and adjudication of all construction, design and construction supervision contracts, including pre-qualification and bidding phases.  He/she will evaluate the qualifications of engineers proposed by contractors for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE-related responsibilities.  He/she will also insure verification by FHIS Executing Unit staff that the title to heavy equipment proposed for use in these activities is in proper order and that the machinery is in adequate operational condition for the tasks to be undertaken. 

- Critically review, approve and forward to the Manager all contractor invoices and certified vouchers.

- Maintain a close working relationship with the USAID's Chief Engineer in the MDDI Office. 

- Liaise with scientists, technical experts and engineers of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, and with FHIS Engineers and non-governmental organizations to solicit their technical advice and joint oversight of activities, and to gather such experiences, studies, designs and technical data which may be useful to enhance MDA INFRASTRUCTURE effectiveness.

- Liaise with and insure that municipal engineers and environmental units are actively involved in construction activity oversight, to the degree that their expertise and interest permit.

- Insure that the FHIS Executing Unit inspects, measures and monitors all construction activities to assure contract compliance and consistency with acceptable engineering practices and security measures.

- Work with the Manager to insure that FHIS Executing Unit staff are effecting proper technical oversight and payment certifications and that they dedicate approximately 60% of their time to field inspections during both design and contract implementation phases.

- Insure that vigorous supervision and quality control systems are enforced by Senior Inspectors, who will in turn do the same with contract consulting engineers/supervisors.  Through personal field inspections, insure compliance with environmental protection provisions, contract designs, specifications, regulations and procedures, use of specified quality materials, correct measurement of construction activities/advances, and other contract provisions.

- He/She must be able to recommend technically sound and financially viable solutions to complex engineering problems related to water, drainage and sanitation infrastructure.

- Adhere, and assure that staff under his/her supervision observe and strictly comply with confidentiality and integrity requirements throughout the design, contracting and execution process in accordance with a written professional code of ethics established by the Manager. 

- Promptly recommend in writing to the Manager and CAT the termination of any MDA INFRASTRUCTURE contractor or staff whose performance demonstrates a violation of transparency, or any contractor or staff who exhibits, in the Chief Engineer's opinion, substantial technical deficiencies and/or irregularities.

- Review and provide approval to the accuracy of designs and specifications of projects. Suggest design adjustments deemed cost effective and practical.

- Assure that municipalities receiving projects constructed with USAID funds are ready to operate and maintain them.  (This may include coordination with local beneficiary communities as well.)

- Assure that required environmental studies are prepared and approved by USAID and Honduran authorities before starting construction of works.

Duration

The duration of this contract will be twenty (20) months, with an option to extend for an additional six (6) months.

Reporting relationships

As currently contemplated, this is a USAID direct contract with an individual for non-personal services (non-PSC).  The Contractor shall provide the services described in this Scope of Work to FHIS to assist it in accomplishing the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  The Contractor will report directly to the Manager.  

This position is subject to availability of funding for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE implementation.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, operations and all associated work required to perform Firm-Fixed Price Structural Repairs to Pier 4, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA in accordance with contract specifications, which include, but are not limited to: 
Epoxy injection of cracks, repair of spalls and delaminations, underwater concrete repair, structurally upgrading the load capacity on the approach section, polyurethane injection of construction joints between Bents 24 to 37, repair of an expansion joint, and replacement of the catwalks and ladders of Pier 4.  The repairs also include performing bond capacity tests on the repair and upgrade materials and other incidental related work.
The primary goal of this project is to extend the useful life of the pier.  This is achieved by filling existing cracks, repairing deteriorated concrete, and replacing corroded reinforcing steel.  Piling and cylinders will also be repaired with specialty underwater materials and methods.
The estimated duration of the project is 20 months.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work around ongoing operations occurring both on the deck and alongside the pier, requiring a substantial coordination effort between the Contractor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) during the project. The Contractor will be required to remove all equipment and materials that may interfere with PSNS operations upon a 48-hour notice.
The contract is broken into four phases to control the project quantities and schedule.   Phase A is all work to the 1933 approach section, including repairs, upgrades, and replacements above mean higher high water (MHHW).  Phase B is the 1914 pier section above MHHW, and Phase C is the 1923 pier section above MHHW.  Underwater (below MHHW) work is lumped into Phase D.  Phase D is an overlapping phase to occur sometime during the project.  This phase must remain flexible to comply with the work restrictions imposed by the Hydraulic Projects Approval (HPA) permit.

The NAICS Code is 234990 with a size standard of $17 Million. This solicitation is open to all business concerns. This acquisition will be competed under Source Selection procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government price and technical factors considered.

<DESC>The objective of the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL's) Natural Gas Storage Program, and the upcoming solicitation, is to encourage and support research and technology development to advance natural gas storage, transmission, and distribution technologies to enhance operational flexibility and deliverability of the Nation's gas storage system, and provide a cost-effective, safe, and reliable supply of natural gas to meet demand in new and expanded market regions. To achieve program objectives, DOE/NETL, through the Strategic Center for Natural Gas, will be requesting applications addressing, but not limited to, the following topics: 1) Thin-bedded salt cavern design technology - seeks proposals to investigate long-term geotechnical integrity of bedded salt cavern designs.   The ability to develop stable gas storage caverns in thinly bedded salt could have implications for new storage capacity in the Eastern, Northeast, and Midwest United States.  Proposed research could include geologic analysis, failure analysis and definition, and improved geotechnical design to mitigate possible failure.  2) Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Applications in Gas Storage - seeks proposals to investigate applications of LNG for conventional storage and distributed, or peaking power generation.  3) Hydrate Control - seeks proposals for control of natural gas hydrates formed in storage wells and gathering lines during rapid withdrawal operations.  4) Deliverability enhancement - seeks proposals that will increase deliverability from aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs.  This could include "smart" storage systems that will optimize storage field operations. Proposed approaches are anticipated to develop new or novel technologies, or suggest innovative applications of existing technologies.  Efforts can encompass any combination of theory, laboratory validation of concepts, or field validation of concepts.  The overall goal of this solicitation shall be to work toward a demonstration of the technology at a commercially scalable size.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Modification to a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price contract N00019-00-D-0164, with Lockheed Martin Corporation to increase the dollar values of option years 3 and 4 to correct significant software problems with the E-6 Mission Computer (MSC). MCS has been experiencing reliability problems in the fleet, and is currently the second highest mission degrader of all systems aboard the E-6 aircraft. Due to these problems, the E-6 PRE budget was significantly increased in FY02. Lockheed Martin is the Software Support Activity (SSA) for the MCS system.  The current yearly funding ceiling on this contract is insufficient to deal with current fleet problems and deficiencies, and must be increased accordingly. Therefore, the ceiling for the remaining option years 3 and 4 are increased to 2.5M per year.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  See Note 22. *****

<DESC>The DOE intends to award a sole source acquisition to Frost & Sullivan.  The contractor will expand on market research already in progress to explore how changes in the structure of the electricity market will affect the electricity cost and demand structure and end use prices, as well as customers' ability to leave or reduce their dependence on the grid in competitive and regulated regions, by customer class.  The contractor will identify and screen new types of electicity service "products" and technology innovations most likely to impact electricity prices and will focus on those that utilities and competitive electricity suppliers believe will give tham a competitive edge. Examples of these include: (1) new electricity product offerings such as "green energy", "total energy management", and real-time pricing and other demand response options; (2) bundling of electricity with other utility services; (3) the use of the internet for billing, metering and energy management; and (4) other technology developments which may be changing the cost structure for electricity providers.  In addition, the contractor will describe the U.S. outlook for self-generation and distributed generation as facilitated by new regulations, such as sell-back provisions, also called net metering, and improving technology/economics.  This will include an estimate of how many customers by class have already left or reduced dependence on the grid and what the determining factors were.  Results and data research will be used to update the Electricity Market Module (EMM) of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) for the Annual Energy Outlook 2003 and will contribute to DOEs ongoing analysis of price uncertainty in electricity markets.  This proposed action is estimated to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, September 30, 2002. This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. This proposed simplified acquisition is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties that feel they can provide the service may respond by registering via the IPPS at http://e-center.doe.gov and submitting their capability statement electronically, referencing the above listed solicitation number indicated in this notice, including pricing information.  All submissions must be received within forty-five (45) days of the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. RFQ-NCI-20035-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-06.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized in FAR 13.6.

The North American Industry Classification code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small business.

Background:  The Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit DNP of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently engaged in the study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the mammalian olfactory system.  These studies use expressed fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, dsRed) in the olfactory system and will focus on imaging primary afferents as they converge and form synapses onto the olfactory bulbs.  Since these fluorophores have highly overlapping emission spectra the ability to separate their individual fluorescent signals is critical to the outcome of the experiments.

Requirement: . High power 2-photon laser system with wide tuning range.  The tunibility (700nm and 1000nm) is essential, a high-power (10W) laser source is required; to reduce phototoxicity, that power is confined to intense, ultrafast (100 MHz) pulses of light (each pulse is <100 fs in duration). The laser must be passively modelocked and use a variable saturable absorber for preferential control between CW and modelocked operation since this configuration provides a means for controlling loss differential as well as gain differential which is necessary for reliable operation and control of the spectral purity of the modelocked output.  This allows for two different methods of mode-locking in order to achieve the highest degree of reliability.  This is essential since any CW component can kill our samples and destroy our experiments.  The laser must have an internal diagnostic system which includes: (1) an autoranging five decade fluorescence detector/power meter to facilitate alignment and optimization, (2) a monitor to verify CW spectral content to insure spectral integrity of output and maintain pure modelocked operation, and (3) a biased, fast photodiode to provide a synchronization signal for detector triggering.  This feature facilitate the day-to-day operation of the laser.  The laser must have a thermally-compensated resonator so that the system automatically and passively offsets the effects of thermal fluctuations in the laboratory that cause drift over long periods of operation.  The system should have internal pump laser steering optics for maximum control of the pump beam position into the Ti:Sapphire crystal.   This allow for maximum output of the laser by tuning the pump optics.  The laser must include a separate CW cavity arm to facilitate alignment and also to produce tunable CW output from the laser.  The laser system must have a thermally compensated resonator that automatically offsets the effects of thermal fluctuations to ensures that the Laser System remains stable over long periods of time.  It is critical for the experiments that the wavelength, mode-locking and illumination remain stable and do not fluctuate for extended periods of time.  Since this laser is an integral component of a larger imaging system that requires precise interfacing with a Zeiss confocal system it is essential that the laser system have extensive proven compatibility.  Therefore, a list shall be provided by the vendor of  at least 20 laser systems, installed and proven on Zeiss scopes.  This list shall include an organizations name, phone number and a contact name for reference.  Moreover, since this imaging system is central to our research which involves critically timed developmental experiments typically set in motion weeks ahead of time on a daily staggered fashion, it is crucial that the laser system be available and in full operation on a daily basis or many weeks of experiments will be lost.  Therefore, we require that a qualified service person  be available within 50 miles of the NIH Bethesda, Maryland campus in order to ensure prompt dependable service 

The Laser shall be delivered FOB destination to the The Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit DNP of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) in Bethesda, Maryland and be up and running with ALL specified performance features intact and installed no later than  September 30, 2002.

Offerors must provide descriptive literature, or other materials that demonstrate that their offer meets the foregoing requirements.  The contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror with the lowest-price offer that fully meets the requirements of the solicitation.  

This solicitation incorporates the provisions at FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS, and at FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  The latter provision includes the DUNS Number Addendum.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a change to the requirement advertised on February 20, 2002.  The revised requirement is for a firm fixed price contract for the manufacture and delivery of 14 Semi-Autonomous Hydrographic Reconnaissance Vehicle (SAHRV) systems, 1 spare SAHRV system, and 3 REMUS vehicles, along with associated support for these systems for FY 02.  In addition, 3 spare SAHRV systems are option requirements for FY 02 and FY 03, with the associated training, repair/maintenance, logistics and support for both the SAHRV and REMUS units as option requirements for FY 03 thru FY 06.  NAVSEA plans to incorporate pre-planned product improvements into the systems in the near future.  As stated previously, NAVSEA intends to negotiate this effort sole source to Hydroid Incorporated, 81 Technology Park Drive, East Falmouth MA 02536.  Hydroid Inc. was established with the cooperation of WHOI for the manufacture and ILS of the SAHRV.  As such, Hydroid is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the SAHRV, and the only source capable of completing the requirement within the required timeframe to support the Navys needs.  No other source has the technical qualification and necessary resources to either perform the work described herein, or will any other supplies or services satisfy the Navys requirements.  Companies interested in subcontract opportunities should contact Hydroid Inc. directly.  See Numbered Note 22

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research announces the FY 2003 Young Investigator Program (YIP), in which U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents holding tenure track or permanent positions at U.S. institutions of higher education, who received Ph.D. (or equivalent) degrees on or after 01 November 1997, are invited to submit research proposals in support of naval research interests. A description of the Department of the Navy's current priority research areas is available by selecting "science and technology" on the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil. About 24 grant awards of up to $100,000.00 per year for three years (with the possibility of greater support to purchase capital equipment and/or through matching funds) are anticipated.  Selection criteria are: (1)past performance, demonstrated by the significance and impact of previous research, publications, professional activities, awards and other recognition, etc.; (2)a creative research proposal, demonstrating the potential
for making progress in an important, naval-relevant scientific area; and (3)a long-term commitment by the institution of higher education to the applicant and the research.  The ONR Young Investigator Program is not a "research initiation" opportunity with standards that are less demanding than ONR's regular research grant program. ONR's Young Investigator awards are intended to confer honor upon awardees beyond the research funding being provided. Details regarding proposal preparation
are provided in the FY 2003 YIP full announcement. The full announcement is provided as an attachment to this notice and it can also be accessed through the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil/ (select science and technology, then Corporate Programs Division).  Applications for the FY 2003 competition must be received by ONR by 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, 1 November 2002

<DESC>NA The work will be performed at two locations as identified below.  New Pass:  The authorized channel at New Pass is 8 feet and 10 feet.  The New Pass maintenance dredging will consist of dredging approximately 238,000 cubic yards of material from the existi ng channel.  The bid will be structured as a base plus three options with the dredged material being distributed between the two beaches north and south of New Pass (Longboat Key and Lido Key, respectively).  The base will dredge approximately 208,000 cubi c yards from Cuts 1 and 2, which has a required depth of 10 feet (MLLW) plus 2-feet allowable overdepth.  The required depth for the three options is 8 feet (MLLW) plus 1-foot allowable overdepth.  Option 1 will dredge approximately 8,000 cubic yards from Cut 3 station 9+00 through Cut 4 station 9+00.  Option 2 will dredge approximately 17,000 cubic yards from Cut 6 station 2+00 to station 32+00.  Option 3 will dredge approximately 5,000 cubic yards from the turning basin.  The Longboat Key Disposal Area is  located a maximum distance of 7,300 feet north of the New Pass channel and the Lido Beach Disposal Area is located a maximum distance of 13,500 feet south of the New Pass channel.

The alternative will require the Contractor to degrade the berm from its existing elevation (approximately 5.0 feet NGVD) down to elevation 3.0 feet NGVD and to evenly  distribute the 123,000 cubic yards over the 8,500-foot long placement area.  The distance from the turning basin to the channel entrance is approximately 18,000 feet.  Work also includes Turbidity Monitoring, Endangered Species Observers, and Beach Tillin g.  Gordon Pass:  The authorized channel in Gordon Pass is 10 feet and 12 feet.  The Gordon Pass maintenance dredging will consist of dredging approximately 115,000 cubic yards of material from the existing channel in Cuts 1 through 7.  This dredging will be structured as a base plus two options.  The material will be placed on the beach south of Gordon Pass on Keewaydin Island.  The required depth is 12 feet (MLLW) for the outer parts of the channel (Stations 0+00 to 44+35.55 of Cut 1) and 10 feet (MLLW) f or the remainder of the channel.   There is a 2-foot allowable overdepth in these areas.  The 4,000-foot long Beach Disposal Area starts 300 feet south of the Gordon Pass channel.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms intends to award on a sole source commercial item basis to Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research for the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative.  This project is aimed at reducing youth firearm violence.  ATF and law enforcement agencies throughout the country are working on developing new information about the illegal trafficking of firearms to young people, and are working on new methods of reducing the illegal supply of firearms to them.  The National Tracing Center, which is coprised of the National Tracing Branch and the Crime Gun Analysis Branch, is responsible for the oversight of the information compiled through this program.  As part of this initiative, Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies have agreed to provide information on all recovered crime guns to the NTC.  This information is housed in the Firearms Tracing System database and will then be analyzed and researched to seek to identify firearm trafficking trends and patterns.

5.) We have published government rate in our Marketing, Media and Public Information schedule (GS-23F-0136K), however we are wondering how you would like to see pricing for the evaluations. Are you looking for a separate hourly rate for each task under 5.0 or are you looking for one hourly rate, which will be multiplied by the 1200 hours stated in 4.0 

Answers are as follows: 
1) No. 
2) Joelle Jordan Communications is the incumbent for this work. 
3) The IRS Oversight Board defines media as all relevant media. 
4) The work to be performed is defined in the Statement of Work. 
5) One hourly rate is desired. 

Additional Questions/Answers:

1.    Is the fax you sent to Kim the entire RFP or is there more?  If there is more where do we go to download?

Answer: You have the entire RFP.

2.    Is there a current contract in place for this work or was the IRS Oversight Board conducting this work on its own?

Answer: There is a current contract for this work.

3.    Can we incorporate examples of similar work into the technical proposal with the past performance or just the past performance?

Answer: You can provide whatever you believe presents your past performance most favorably.

4.    Is there a page limit for the technical proposal?

Answer: There is no page limit but concise expression of thought is a valuable characteristic of the required work.

5.    Do you want staffing plan/bios for key personnel?

Answer: Your proposal should provide whatever detail you believe is necessary for a staffing level of 1200 hours per year.

6.    The RFP states that the Board meets BI-monthly ? please confirm this is every other month?

Answer: Bi-monthly is every other month.

7.    What months does the board meet (begin in January)?

The Oversight Board sets its calendar at the start of every year. It does not always meet the same months every year. In 2002, the Board has already met in January and April, and is scheduled to meet in June, July, September, and December.

8.    Confirm only looking for approach and capabilities, not ideas in the response.

Answer: Your response should provide what was requested in the RFP.

9.    Who would we be working with at the Oversight Board ? do they have a public affairs person or would we coordinate with people in the IRS legislative affairs and public affairs office?

Answer: The SOW specifies that the contractor would be working with the Staff Director and the Chairman.

10.    What triggered putting this work out for bid?

Answer: The need for the type of services requested in the SOW triggered the RFP. The level of effort is such that a full-time staff person is not needed.

11.    Will this contract be FAR regulated?

Answer: Yes.

12.    The RFP requires a written technical proposal with two copies to be submitted on May 17 @ 4:30.  Do you require an original and two copies of the business proposal?

Answer: Yes, Please submit two copies each of your technical, business and price proposals.

13.    The RFP states the business proposal is due at 4:00 p.m. and the technical is due at 4:30.  Please confirm the technical and business proposals may be submitted together on May 17th at 4:30.

Answer: All proposals must be submitted together no later than 4:30 P.M.. The deadline does not preclude early delivery.

14.    Do you want to see the detail for the quote or just a "quote for the deliverables or a quote for each activity?"

        For example:
        Activity 1 -- Communication with press = $.
        Activity 2 -- Annual Report = $

        or quote for the deliverables?

        Deliverable 1 -- Draft, edit and review the annual report and
any additional reports submitted to Congress

        Deliverable 2 -- Draft a press release within 24 hours following
each IRS Oversight Board meeting?

        Deliverable 3 -- Assist in the preparation and submission of the
annual report on electronic filing.

        Do you want the proposed contractor to provide the payment terms for the deliverables?

Answer: The government expects a quote for a single hourly rate.

NOTE:  In an effort to avoid any further delay in the award process of this requirement, no additional questions will be accepted/addressed effective immediately.

SALARY RANGE BEGINNING AT: $90,000

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Honduras (USAID/Honduras) is seeking applications (Optional Form 612, Standard Form 171, or Resume) for a Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) of a U.S. Manager for the Municipal Infraestructure Rehabilitation and Constructiong through FHIS in Honduras.  Submissions shall be in accordance with Scope of Work herewith to the following address:
Office of Contract Management, USAID/Honduras, Unit 2927, APO AA 34022 or by fax no. 011 (504) 236-7776.

SCOPE OF WORK
U. S. Manager
FHIS Executing Unit
Municipal Development Activity:
"Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Contraction through FHIS"

Background:  Municipal Development Activity

Devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in late-October 1998, and the associated flooding which continued through January 1999, resulted in the deaths of thousands of Hondurans, left nearly a million people temporarily homeless and caused incalculable crop, equipment, and infrastructure damage. The impact on water, drainage, and sanitation systems in Honduras was particularly severe.

The Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Contraction through FHIS of the Municipal Development Activity (MDA INFRASTRUCTURE Infrastructure) of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program is supporting the construction of works related with the repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of water, drainage, sewerage and landfill systems damaged by Hurricane Mitch as well as the establishment of new systems in sites where families displaced by the hurricane have been relocated.

It is expected that approximately 30 municipalities will benefit from major repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of their basic water, drainage and sanitation systems.  Design and construction of the systems will be contracted by the FHIS Executing Unit in close collaboration with municipal governments.

Expected results include: 1) rehabilitation and expansion of approximately 24 urban water supply and 27 urban sanitation systems that will be operated by municipal governments; 2) construction of eight new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations; and 3) comprehensive storm drainage systems constructed in five secondary cities. 

Private sectors firms will be contracted to execute reconstruction and regular assistance activities; day-to-day supervision will be provided primarily by individual contract consulting engineers and supervisors.  An estimated 20 firms are expected to be involved, including contractors and supervisory firms.

FHIS Executing Unit

The implementation of these construction projects had originally been undertaken by the Directorate for Major Infrastructure (DIM) of the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS).  Under the direction of the DIM/FHIS, approximately 12 water systems, 15 sanitation systems, 5 new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations, and 3 drainage systems have been contracted and completed for a value of US$40 million.  In an effort to improve the timely contracting and execution of the remainder of the water and sanitation systems (with an expected cost of US$30 million), implementation responsibilities have been transferred to an executing unit within FHIS ("FHIS Executing Unit").  This executing unit has been given the necessary authority to contract the remaining water and sanitation construction, and manage existing construction contracts within the established timeframe.  Under the direction of its U.S. citizen Manager (the "Manager"), the FHIS Execution Unit, which responds directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee is the entity responsible for the tendering process, supervision of construction contracts, and completion of the established objectives.

A similar executing unit was established to contract and build the roads and bridges activities of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program.  Through approximately May 31, 2002, this executing unit will be responsible for closing out the roads and bridges component while assuming responsibility for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE.  On or about June 1, 2002, the FHIS Executing Unit will be solely responsible for the implementation of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE.

This executing unit is unique because of its special authority to manage and execute construction contracts.  It is a unit entirely within the supervision of the Minister of FHIS, but is also unique in that all staff, both U.S. and Honduran nationals, are contracted with USAID program funds (i.e., MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE funds).

Headed by a U.S. citizen Manager, the FHIS Executing Unit will be comprised of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE-financed Honduran staff to implement the contracting, field supervision, financial administration, and concurrent auditing activities.  A U. S. citizen will also be contracted for the position of Chief Engineer and will serve as the FHIS Executing Unit's chief technical, scientific and engineering expert.  Under the supervision of the Manager, the Chief Engineer will insure that the FHIS Executing Unit inspects, measures and monitors all construction activities and provides regular assistance to assure contract compliance and adherence to acceptable engineering practices; that the engineering staff are effecting proper technical oversight and payment certifications; and that they are dedicating approximately 60% of their time to field inspections during both design and contract implementation phases. To facilitate the engineering oversight, the Manager, with input from the Chief Engineer, will develop standard formats for supervision record keeping and maintenance of daily staff activity and travel records.

The remainder of FHIS Executing Unit staff will include approximately xx senior Honduran water and sanitation engineer experts, xx middle-level Honduran field engineers, two contracts specialist engineer, xx financial officer, and a complement of administrative and support staff.  The FHIS Executing Unit will also include a two-person Internal Concurrent Audit Team (CAT), which unlike the rest of the staff, will report directly to the FHIS Controllers and USAID controllers.  

Role of Manager 

The MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE will be managed by a U. S. citizen Manager, who is chiefly and personally responsible for achieving the results set forth in the agreements, amendments and implementation letters, in accordance with all relevant procedures established in the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE operational manual. Despite being contracted by USAID, the Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee.

The Manager must be a senior, widely experienced and recognized expert in construction/reconstruction program management who without significant external guidance will be capable of using leadership skills, independent judgment and initiative to assume management responsibility for a uniquely ambitious undertaking.  He/she will be responsible for assuming lead responsibility of the FHIS Executing Unit, devising and improving implemention procedures when necessary, and managing in an independent manner its technical, financial, contractual, and supervisory functions, as well as ensuring that established procedures for the internal concurrent audit are followed.

The Manager will be responsible for the supervision of the entire staff of the FHIS Executing Unit in accordance with the procedures established in the operational manual.  These responsibilities include monitoring staff performance, renewing personnel contracts, establishing salaries, and hiring or eliminating staff as needed.  New contracting and separation of all Honduran FHIS Executing Unit staff will be done with the concurrence of FHIS (with the exception of the FHIS Executing Unit Internal Concurrent Audit Team which will be approved by USAID and FHIS Controllers), as established in the operational manual.  Otherwise, the Manager will be expected to supervise and make personnel decisions independently, appealing to the FHIS Minister or his designee on a limited basis, such as for interpretation or clarification of personnel policies.  

The Manager will establish internal procedures for managing the contracting process, including rigorous pre-qualification and bidding processes, and will critically review and approve for payment all invoices and vouchers submitted by contractors and vendors.  No contracts will be executed under this component, and no transfer or disbursements of funds from MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE accounts will be executed without advance written authorization from the Manager.  

The Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee and provide both FHIS and USAID with updates at regular intervals to be determined jointly.  The Manager will promptly bring to the personal attention of the FHIS Minister, USAID, and the CAT, major problems which come to his/her attention which could affect the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE's transparency or achievement of results.

The Manager will work independently with FHIS and other GOH officials, host country entities, municipal governments, USAID and other donor agencies as needed.  He/she may be called upon to brief senior U.S. Government officials and Members of the United States Congress visiting Honduras.  The Manager will insure that complex challenges in maintaining transparency and ensuring the durability and quality of these expensive reconstruction investments are overcome.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the water and sanitation systems, the Manager will coordinate closely with the USAID Municipal Development Program.  He/she will use a vigorous, hands-on field-oriented approach, which is expected to include significant field travel. 


Contract Management

The Manager will establish and insure compliance with transparent procedures for:  1) overall supervision of ongoing construction activities including technical oversight and financial monitoring; 2) the contracting and supervision of new water/sewer/drainage systems, flood protection works, and landfills; 3) the contracting and technical oversight of supervisory engineering firms and/or individuals.   The Manager will insure that the pre-qualification process includes verification of the credentials and capabilities of proposed engineering staff.  During the construction phase, the Manager will insure that FHIS Executing Unit staff verify, through on-site inspections, the title and condition of equipment utilized matches or exceeds the equipment included in the proposals.  The Manager will insure that opportunities to bid are publicly advertised to pre-qualified firms, and that bids are processed, considered and adjudicated in accordance with the requirements set forth in the agreements, amendments and implementation letters (which may amended from time to time), and the appropriate sections of the operational manual.  He/she will assure, through management of the FHIS Executing Unit, timely compliance with contract specifications and conditions. 

Financial Management

At the request of FHIS, USAID will advance MDA INFRASTRUCTURE funds into discrete accounts held by a private Honduran bank.  The funds will be used exclusively for specified purposes.  No transfers or disbursement of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE funds will be made without the advance written authorization of the Manager.  The Manager will be responsible for all advances and monthly liquidations and will insure that all funds are used in a cost-effective manner.  The Manager will oversee the administration of a petty cash fund and will assure FHIS Executing Unit responsiveness to requests from the USAID Controller's office for accruals, projections and other financial data. 

The Internal Concurrent Audit Team (CAT), to be established and/or maintained by the Manager, will aggressively and independently review 100% of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE's financial and contract documentation to insure compliance with the Agreement.  The CAT, which reports directly to the FHIS Controller and USAID Controller will also observe and report on contract pre-qualification and bidding procedures and will independently pursue reports of irregularities.  The CAT will submit a monthly report of findings and observations directly to the FHIS Controller and USAID Controller, with copies to the Manager and senior officials of FHIS and USAID.  The Manager will work collaboratively with the CAT to resolve problems and strengthen procedures, when necessary.  

The Manager will review and improve a written professional code of ethics developed under RECAP and assure staff awareness, understanding and adherence to this code, including the strictest compliance with confidentiality and integrity requirements throughout the design, contracting and execution process. 

In accordance with contract provisions and the operational manual, the Manager will promptly request concurrence of FHIS to terminate any contractor or staff whose performance demonstrates a violation of transparency, or any contractor or staff who exhibits, in the Manager's opinion, substantial technical deficiencies and/or irregularities.  He/she will work with FHIS to pursue all contract and legal remedies available under Honduran law.
 
Technical Liaison

The Manager will establish and maintain systems to ensure that MDA INFRASTRUCTURE activities are smoothly integrated into regular municipal operations in those municipalities where construction will be executed.  He/she will insure that appropriate coordination with the respective municipal engineers and municipal environmental units is undertaken during the planning and oversight of construction activities.  (This may include coordination with local beneficiary communities as well.)

The Manager will assure that the FHIS Executing Unit liaises effectively with USAID/Honduras personnel, technical scientists, experts and engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as needed.  USACE's engineers will continue to be an expert resource available to the Manager and utilized at his or her own discretion and with the concurrence of USAID, to address technical, financial, or quality control issues.  

Special Challenges

The Manager will face challenges arising out of a contracting process in which transparency and adherence to standards has vulnerabilities.  There are three key challenges facing the Manager and the FHIS Executing Unit:

1. Insuring transparency of contracting and financial management;

2. Developing and adhering to technical specifications and designs which promote the durability and sustainability of the water and sanitation systems; and

3. Preparing environmental reviews for submission to USAID to insure the protection of the local environment.

Duration and Termination

The duration of this contract will be twenty (20) months, with an option to extend, if needed, for an additional six (6) months.

As currently contemplated, this is a USAID direct contract with an individual for non-personal services (non-PSC).  The Contractor shall provide the services described in this Scope of Work to FHIS to assist it in accomplishing the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  The Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee.  Furthermore, the contract may be terminated, with or without cause, at the convenience of the U.S. Government.

This position is subject to availability of funding for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE implementation.

A senior, widely experienced and recognized expert in the field of construction/ reconstruction program management who, without significant external guidance, will be capable of using independent judgment and initiative to assume management responsibility for a large-scale ambitious undertaking.

Twelve years of successful hands-on international infrastructure activity management experience, of which five must be in Spanish-speaking Latin America and five in public infrastructure construction.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) as described in FAR 15.201(e); FAR 52.215-3 applies. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Office of Procurement is trying to determine the availability of Automated Purchasing System (APS). To meet the Office?s needs, an APS would have to: (a) be a commercial, off-the-shelf, and Web-based system, operating in a Windows environment; (b) provide a completely seamless and paperless procurement process; (c) handle all types of procurements, at any dollar level, from acquisition planning, through receipt of requisition and award of contract or order, to contract closeout; (d) produce all the necessary documents, allow for coordination and approval among participants in the procurement, and provide the capability of reminding the contract administrator when a new action must be taken; (e) contain continuously updated electronic versions of the FAR, the Department of the Treasury Acquisition Regulation (DTAR) and all the forms needed in the procurement process; (f) provide flexible search capability for the FAR and DTAR databases; (g) be capable of direct interface with external systems such as the Treasury Acquisition Data System (TADS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the Central Contractor Registry (CCR); and (h) include the capability to query the system?s database and produce reports as needed. The system would be accessible by web interface by approximately 45 users in the Bureau?s Washington DC and Fort Worth TX facilities. Initially, it would operate with no direct interface to other internal systems, although the potential for interface is desirable. Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer. Such information should include: (a) the technical capabilities of the system offered: (b) a statement as to whether or not the system can accommodate specific needs, and, if so, a description of which functions(s) of the system can be configured and the relative degree of difficulty in configuration; (c) the approximate timeframe for installation of the system and training of user personnel; and (d) the price for installation, training, and maintenance/update/support of the system for one year Interested vendors should also indicate whether or not they have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and, if so, provide the schedule and contract number. Information should be submitted by the date, and to the contact point, specified above.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information for the purpose of obtaining qualified vendors to submit capability statement and cost of a system that can monitor temperatures in refrigerators for both the Pharmacy and CRC units for the Warren Magnuson Grant Clinical Center within the National Institutes of Health.  This is not a request for proposals or quotes, and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Within the capability statement and cost requirements the following needs to be addressed:


GENERAL

The Clinical Center (CC) is the research hospital for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) The CC provides medical and research services for patients and volunteers participating in human research protocols.

In 2004, the NIH will open the Clinical Research Center (CRC).  The CRC will include acute and intensive care patient units (approximately 225 beds) and Day Hospitals.  All Inpatient Care Units will be relocated from the existing building.  Outpatients will be seen and treated in the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Day Hospitals in the CRC.

The CC Pharmacy Department is responsible for procuring, storing, and dispensing all drugs to CC inpatients and outpatients.  The Procurement, Inpatient Dispensing, Outpatient Dispensing, and Pharmaceutical Development (PDS) Pharmacy Sections are involved with these processes.  The Inpatient and Outpatient dispensing sections will be relocated to the CRC.  The CRC Pharmacy will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Both PDS and Procurement will remain (in a yet to be finalized location) in Bldg. 10 and maintain the need to store medications.

Medication refrigerators, and in some cases freezers, will be located in the patient care units and Day Hospitals in the CRC and in the ACRF.  The CRC Pharmacy will have one large walk-in refrigerator, one walk-in freezer, and several other smaller refrigerators and freezers.  Procurement will have one refrigerator and one freezer.  PDS will have one walk-in refrigerator, several smaller refrigerators, and several freezers.

The ability to closely and continuously monitor refrigerator and freezer temperatures in the patient care areas is a JCAHO requirement.  In addition, Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsors require that the Pharmacy Department monitor and record drug storage conditions (room temperature, refrigerator, and freezer) in all medication storage areas (PDS, Procurement, & the CRC Pharmacy) to demonstrate that their drug was stored correctly. 

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

The purpose of this request is to receive information and budgetary pricing regarding temperature alarm, monitoring, and repair systems.  The Pharmacy Department has a need for two separate systems.  The first system would apply to the medication storage areas in the Pharmacy (CRC) and PDS and Procurement (both relocated in Bldg 10).  The second system would apply to the medication refrigerators and freezers on the patient care units (CRC Inpatient and Day Hospital units and ACRF).  Both systems would be monitored in the CRC Pharmacy.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), and Adelphi Laboratory Center, (ALC) Adelphi, MD, seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Electric and Water Distribution Systems at Adelphi, Maryland.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for ALC and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.

OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire electric and water distribution systems and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner(s).  Utility services under the potential contract will not include commodity supply.  Therefore the owner of the distribution network and equipment need not also generate or resell electric power or water to Adelphi Laboratory Center.  

INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Note:	(1).  All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  This data was developed using data provided by the ALC Directorate of Installation Services and DESC is not responsible for the accuracy of the information at each site-specific installation.  Companies responding to this notice of interest are responsible for verification of all inventory data.

(2).  Companies responding to this notice of interest should respond to interest in the entire scope of either the electric or water requirement (or both).

Adelphi Laboratory Center (ALC) is located in Adelphi, Maryland.

DESCRIPTION OF ELECTRIC FACILITIES:  The utility systems consist of approximately the following electrical distribution system:

a.	Distribution Lines:

d.	ALC connects to the WSSC's water system at two locations
-	(1) a 10-inch main meter, located in the southwest corner of ALC along Powder Mill Road, connects to WSSC's 20-inch main
-	(2) a 10-inch main meter located in the 500 building area that is not currently not in use.

e.	The main area is served by a looped system of 
-	10-inch lines. An 8-inch line serves the 400 area facilities 
-	A looped 10-inch line serves the 500 area facilities. 
-	Both facility groups are metered at the Floral Drive Bridge. 
-	The system contains valves to provide minimum interruptions of service for repair and 
-	Each building has backflow prevention.

f.	Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) currently provides both water and wastewater distribution/collection services on ALC property.  WSCC owns approximately 37% of the wastewater collection on ALC property;

PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the electrical and water distribution systems at Adelphi Laboratory Center.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming.   Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state of Maryland and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact and e-mail address.

SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  

DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EPP) by May 28, 2002 by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a basic ordering agreement (BOA) to Health Net Federal Services, on a sole source basis, for providing their Preferred Pricing Program services to VISN 2, VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York (Albany, Bath, Buffalo, Canandaigua and Syracuse).  The applicable NAICS Code is 524298.  This service makes health care provider network preferred pricing available to the VA when eligible veterans use contracted providers for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, and other services. The program covers fee basis claims in excess of $150.   The VA establishes eligibility, confirms that the service is a covered benefit, and determines the VA allowable amount (the amount the VA would have paid on that particular claim).  Health Net determines if the claim is from a participating provider with whom a discounted price has been contracted and if so provides the VA with the contracted rate.  The VA retains responsibility for paying the providers.  Health Nets fee is a percentage of the actual savings achieved.  The initial term of the BOA will be for one year from date of award, with 4 option years, and may be terminated by either party with 30 days notice.  The anticipated date of award is NLT May 30, 2002.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses from responsible sources will be considered.

<DESC>NA PROJECT TITLE:  Evaluating the Use of Alternate Landfill Cover Designs LOCATION:  Edwards Air Force Base, California JOB DESCRIPTION:  SOURCES SOUGHT/NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE WITH ONE SOURCE.  The proposed contract action is for services, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the Division of Hydrologic Sciences and the Center for Arid Lands Envi ronmental Management, Desert Research Institute (DRI), Reno and Las Vegas, NV unless, as a result of analysis of acceptable responses to this notice, a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation.  DRI is the sole source abl e to provide these services due to their ongoing research and studies currently being conducted for the Department of Defense, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Energy. DRI provides demonstrated knowledge in addressing co mplex, multidisciplinary environmental problems in Californias arid settings; knowledge of uses and limitations of alternative, evapotranspiration-based, landfill covers; knowledge of current research in the specific disciplines of soil, climate, plants, and numerical modeling of vadose zone processes; knowledge of how site conditions (climate, soil parent material, hydrology) interact to produce stable soil surfaces known as desert pavements; and knowledge of how environmental processes, including vegetat ion, biota, climate, and soil properties interact during the evolution of cover systems.  The required services are to study and develop a base-wide analysis of alternative landfill cover designs for Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), which will incorporate th e properties of existing or proposed material used for landfill covers at EAFB and other environmental factors (i.e., animal habitats) into a cover design process that can be used throughout the facility.  The study results will be tested through the use o f computer models to predict long-term behavior and to identify optimum site-specific design parameters using three-dimensional nomograms.  The base-wide analysis includes a survey of the soil, plant, and climate parameters; a state-of-art design procedure ; and extensive numerical modeling, to unify the technical approach for designing cover systems for the entire base. All interested persons may respond or submit statements of qualifications.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.  The Government will consider responses received within 45 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is within the discretion of the Government.

This Open Season solicitation will remain in effect until March 13, 2005 unless replaced by an updated solicitation or rescinded.  SP0200-02-R8000 is a continuation of the multiple award contract initiative originating under RFP SP0200-01-R-8000.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) in an effort to improve medical supply support to our customers has developed the Electronic Catalog (ECAT) System.  The ECAT System allows DSCP (CONUS AND OCONUS) customers to review and compare contractor electronic catalogs with the ultimate goal of placing on-line orders to the contractor of their choice.

DSCP military and other government customers are currently using the ECAT System to order medically related laboratory, dental and optical supplies and limited medical equipment.

DSCP Medical Equipment Group intends to enter into firm fixed-price with economic price adjustment, indefinite quantity type contracts for medical equipment, maintenance of medical equipment, and/or spare parts/repair parts of medical equipment used by medical professionals, technicians and laboratory personnel to perform a treatment, test or operation.  All items are brand name specific or generic commercial products, which are identified by the manufacturer's item descriptions and part numbers and conform to the manufacturer's commercial specifications.  This Open Season solicitation will remain in effect until March 13, 2005 unless replaced by an updated solicitation or rescinded.  SP0200-02-R8000 is a continuation of the multiple award contract initiative originating under RFP SP0200-01-R-8000.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.
