ISSUANCE DATE	        :	October 17, 2003
CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED
 FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS:	November 17, 2003 at 3:00 in the  afternoon, Manila time.
POSITION TITLE	        :	Senior Education Advisor
MARKET VALUE	        :	GS-15
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE	:	o/a March 15, 2004 ¡V March 14, 2006
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE	:	Manila, Philippines
JOB DESCRIPTION	:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Philippines has recently received USAID/Washington approval for a new Strategic Objective (SO) for education for 2004-2009.  The new SO was approved as an addition to the current Mission strategy for 1999-2004, but will be carried into a new strategy being developed for 2005-2009.  (Information on the current strategy can be obtained from the website http://www.usaid-ph.gov)  Relative to the current strategy, ongoing discussions for developing the new strategy indicate that the new strategy most likely will refine and update three existing SOs on economic governance, family planning and health, and environment and energy, expand the Mindanao conflict SO to cover other conflict-affected areas, and continue implementation of the recently approved SO for education.

The Philippines education system was once one of the best in all of Asia.  However, the system has deteriorated drastically over the last generation in both quality and access.  Key comparative advantages are eroding.  President Arroyo and education analysts have raised concern about the decline in English language competency and general academic performance among Philippines graduates.  It has also been noted that English language competency is directly related to the economic health of the nation as many Filipinos work overseas and provide remittances.  There is also recognition of the need for teacher training in all subject matter with particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT).  The President, to address the decline in educational performance, has required that Math and Science return to English as the language of instruction.  

The situation is most acute in Mindanao and within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in particular.  The ARMM remains the poorest area of the Philippines and has correspondingly low social indicators.  The quality of education is typically poor and, according to reliable information, a certain proportion of Islamic teachers are adherents of Wahabi Islam and impart messages to their students that are consistent with the appeals of terrorist groups.

Improved access to quality education is widely seen by the Filipino people as a means to a better life.  It can play an important role in helping Muslim Filipinos become more effective players in the country¡¦s pluralistic and democratic state.  Increased access to education will help address alienation of the Muslim population, and help them see a better future as part of the Philippine state.  Improved education will help level the playing field and reduce marginalization of this population to enable them to compete for employment opportunities and participate more fully in economic growth.  

USAID/Philippines new education program intends to improve access to, and the quality of, education. Efforts will focus particularly on reducing the differences between education opportunities in Mindanao, especially the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas, and the rest of the nation.  This will include helping to prepare the next generation of Muslim leaders, professionals and decision-makers, and which will require higher education training as well.  The program also will address the special problems of out-of-work youth in the conflict-affected areas. It will help address systemic weaknesses, including corruption in the provision of goods and services.  Activities will include: (1) expanding and improving community-based learning activities in both formal and non-formal education sectors; (2) enhancing capacity for teaching Math, Science and English; (3) improving education sector policies at the local and national levels; and (4) reintegrating out-of-school youth in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.  USAID/Philippines will implement this program through local partners in collaboration with a U.S. Government (USG) interagency working group including the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Service (PAS) and the Peace Corps (PC), and other donors.  USAID will also encourage U.S. and Philippine private sector groups involved in education through corporate social responsibility programs to play an important role by engaging in productive partnerships. USAID will also incorporate other efforts already underway.   

Under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao - 2 Program (GEM-2), USAID/Philippines has started activities in education in the ARMM that are already producing encouraging results.  The supported programs aim to (a) increase community awareness of major education problems in the ARMM; (b) help various groups (i.e., parents¡¦ groups, business organizations) improve schools; (c) build the educational planning and analysis capacity of the ARMM Department of Education; (d) improve the English language skills of both school children and the general public; (e) increase computer literacy and internet access in selected schools; and (f) provide selected interventions in key vocational institutions.  GEM-2 is also supporting an internship program for some 15-20 recent graduates of ARMM colleges and universities who will spend some 4-6 months each working as interns in the Philippines House of Representatives.  The Program aims to help the interns develop a greater understanding of the role of Congress in shaping the economic development of the Philippines, and thus play a key role in USAID¡¦s attempts to improve both governance and education in the ARMM.  The new education SO will incorporate these promising activities into the new programs, including possibly replicating successful interventions in other conflict-affected and/or disadvantaged areas of the Philippines.    

As part of the Education SO, USAID/Philippines also recently signed an agreement with the Peace Corps for a Pilot Education Assistance Program. The Program, which will benefit the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, is designed to enhance the capacity of Mindanao¡¦s public school teachers, instructional staff and student teachers.  The program will provide training for them in English education, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) and content-based instruction methodologies and techniques in Math, Science, Health and Environment to enhance their lesson-planning and classroom skills.  

Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, creativity and innovation, discussions and negotiations with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), the ARMM government, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID¡¦s newer substantive involvement in this sector.  The emphasis on public-private sector partnerships also requires significant similar engagement with local and international corporate philanthropic organizations, and NGOs.   

B.	STATEMENT OF WORK

The Senior Education Advisor will serve as the senior technical and policy advisor, as well as Team Leader for the USAID/Philippines Education Sector programs and projects to be designed and implemented under the new, recently approved Mission six-year SO.

«	Develop, nurture and sustain close collaborative, professional relationships with senior (secretary-level) GRP central and local level officials, ARMM officials, other major donors like the World Bank, ADB, the Japanese and AUSAID, corporate philanthropic foundations (in the US and in Philippines), international organizations and leading education research institutions.

«	Carryout and support policy dialogue with senior GRP and ARMM officials and other bilateral and/or multilateral donor officials in consultation with the USDH Deputy Mission Director and the USAID/Philippines Mission Director.
«	Develop and maintain a collaborative, professional relationship with the U.S. Ambassador, senior members of the broader US Mission team, senior GRP and ARMM officials at both the national and local levels, representatives of the U.S. Peace Corps, U.S. Department of Labor, and other donor and corporate organizations supporting human development programs in the Philippines and with USAID-funded implementing partners.

JOB DESCRIPTION	:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Philippines has recently received USAID/Washington approval for a new Strategic Objective (SO) for education for 2004-2009.  The new SO was approved as an addition to the current Mission strategy for 1999-2004, but will be carried into a new strategy being developed for 2005-2009.  (Information on the current strategy can be obtained from the website http://www.usaid-ph.gov.)  Relative to the current strategy, ongoing discussions for developing the new strategy indicate that the new strategy most likely will refine and update three existing SOs on economic governance, family planning and health, and environment and energy, expand the Mindanao conflict SO to cover other conflict-affected areas, and continue implementation of the recently approved SO for education.

The Philippines education system was once one of the best in all of Asia.  However, the system has deteriorated drastically over the last generation in both quality and access.  Key comparative advantages are eroding.  President Arroyo and education analysts have raised concern about the decline in English language competency and general academic performance among Philippines graduates.  It has also been noted that English language competency is directly related to the economic health of the nation as many Filipinos work overseas and provide remittances.  There is also recognition of the need for teacher training in all subject matter with particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT).  The President, to address the decline in educational performance, has required that math and science return to English as the language of instruction.  

The situation is most acute in Mindanao and within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in particular.  The ARMM remains the poorest area of the Philippines and has correspondingly low social indicators.  The quality of education is typically poor. 

Improved access to quality education is widely seen by the Filipino people as a means to a better life.  It can play an important role in helping Muslim Filipinos become more effective players in the country¡¦s pluralistic and democratic state.  Increased access to education will help address alienation of the Muslim population, and help them see a better future as part of the Philippine state.  Improved education will help level the playing field and reduce marginalization of this population to enable them to compete for employment opportunities and participate more fully in economic growth.  

USAID/Philippines new education program intends to improve access to, and the quality of, education. Efforts will focus particularly on reducing the differences between education opportunities in Mindanao, especially the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas, and the rest of the nation.  This will include helping to prepare the next generation of Muslim leaders, professionals and decision-makers, and which will require higher education training as well.  The program also will address the special problems of out-of-work youth in the conflict-affected areas. It will help address systemic weaknesses, including corruption in the provision of goods and services.  Activities will include: (1) expanding and improving community-based learning activities in both formal and non-formal education sectors; (2) enhancing capacity for teaching math, science and English; (3) improving education sector policies at the local and national levels; and (4) reintegrating out-of-school youth in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.  USAID/Philippines will implement this program through local partners in collaboration with a U.S. Government (USG) interagency working group including the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Service (PAS) and the Peace Corps (PC), and other donors.  USAID will also encourage U.S. and Philippine private sector groups involved in education through corporate social responsibility programs to play an important role by engaging in productive partnerships. USAID will also incorporate other efforts already underway.   

Under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao - 2 Program (GEM-2), USAID/Philippines has started activities in education in the ARMM that are already producing encouraging results.  The supported programs aim to (a) increase community awareness of major education problems in the ARMM; (b) help various groups (i.e., parents¡¦ groups, business organizations) improve schools; (c) build the educational planning and analysis capacity of the ARMM Department of Education; (d) improve the English language skills of both school children and the general public; (e) increase computer literacy and internet access in selected schools; and (f) provide selected interventions in key vocational institutions.  GEM-2 is also supporting an internship program for some 15-20 recent graduates of ARMM colleges and universities who will spend some 4-6 months each working as interns in the Philippines House of Representatives.  The Program aims to help the interns develop a greater understanding of the role of Congress in shaping the economic development of the Philippines, and thus play a key role in USAID¡¦s attempts to improve both governance and education in the ARMM.  The new education SO will incorporate these promising activities into the new programs, including possibly replicating successful interventions in other conflict-affected and/or disadvantaged areas of the Philippines.    

As part of the Education SO, USAID/Philippines also recently signed an agreement with the Peace Corps for a Pilot Education Assistance Program. The Program, which will benefit the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, is designed to enhance the capacity of Mindanao¡¦s public school teachers, instructional staff and student teachers.  The program will provide training for them in English education, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) and content-based instruction methodologies and techniques in Math, Science, Health and Environment to enhance their lesson-planning and classroom skills.  

Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, creativity and innovation, discussions and negotiations with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), the ARMM government, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID¡¦s newer substantive involvement in this sector.  The emphasis on public-private sector partnerships also requires significant similar engagement with local and international corporate philanthropic organizations, and NGOs.
