This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

<p>The Small Business size standard is 750 employees.</p>

<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;&nbsp; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.

Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

Any such contract is further anticipated to be have a base period of performance of one (1) year and four (1) year option periods.

At this time the nature of any competition that may result from this market survey has not been determined.

Reasonable accommodation can include, but is not limited to, providing sign language services. Sign language services are provided so that manually communicating employees or visitors who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can participate equally in all facets of their employment or visit at NIST.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four deaf employees who require sign language services on a regular basis for meetings, trainings, and other events. Additionally, NIST hosts a variety of events (such as tours, colloquium talks, conferences and meetings) which are open to the public and may require sign language services. NIST plans to utilize Contractors to provide sign language services on an "as needed" basis to meet requirements, which may vary widely.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to provide expressive and receptive sign language services for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Services may be required at NIST campuses located in Gaithersburg, MD, Boulder, Colorado, and/or Charleston, SC. It is anticipated that the majority of services will be provided on-site at the Gaithersburg, MD campus. Services may also be required at venues other than the NIST campus.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a small business size standard of <br />$15.0 million. Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority <br />of FAR Parts 12 and 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for women-owned small business. Award of multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements are anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-15-RQ-0544.</p>
<p>Potential quoters shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately four (4) days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />ACC-AMIC-RFI-Independent_Research_and_Development <br />Notice Type: Special Notice <br />Synopsis: ACC TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION EXCHANGE EVENTS
<p>Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) senior leaders seek discussions with industry, academia, and other government organizations to explore emerging technologies with potential applications to combat airpower. While not a request for contractual offers or proposals, these Technical Information Exchange (TIE) discussions may offer organizations currently conducting Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) activities the opportunity to exchange insights with Air Force senior leaders and better focus organizational efforts toward Air Force air combat needs in a mutually beneficial manner.<br />The intent of a TIE is to focus senior-level discussions on IR&amp;D projects or efforts that may prove useful in the employment of combat airpower while also affording participants the opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of the combat air forces' near-, mid-, and far-term capability needs. Successful TIEs generate and sustain an ongoing dialogue on emerging technologies relevant to the ACC core functions between ACC leaders and senior-level participants from industry, academia, FFRDCs, intra-governmental organizations and others. TIEs also provide preliminary opportunities for information exchanges in science, technology and innovation on the participant's current projects that may have the potential to bring advanced capability to warfighters. <br />A general officer or civilian equivalent from the Directorate of Plans, Programs and Requirements (ACC/A5/8/9) will host each TIE session. ACC is the primary provider of air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders and the directorate champions the capability needs for five of the twelve Air Force Core Functions: Air Superiority; Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Global Precision Attack; Personnel Recovery; and Command and Control. For reference, the command's capability needs by core function are available on the Defense Technical Information Center SIPR website here: https://reg.dtic.smil.mil/SDTICreg. Note: To access these documents, users must have an active SIPR account and access them through DTIC. In accordance with AFH 31-602, Industrial Security Program, HQ ACC cannot assist organizations or individuals in obtaining SIPR DTIC access or provide an alternative means to access these documents. <br />If interested, e-mail the following items to the contracting POC listed below: (1) brief description and depth of the organization's IR&amp;D portfolio (use Arial Font 12, not to exceed two pages) (2) point(s) of contact for further coordination if selected. Responses are due by 1200 on 15 February 2016. HQ ACC will invite selected participants with key IR&amp;D initiatives that have the greatest potential to address the command's capability needs. Invitees should prepare senior representatives to present ongoing IR&amp;D technology efforts to HQ ACC senior leaders, explain how these efforts could address warfighting capability needs across any of the command's five core functions, and discuss potential implementation strategies. All deliverables will become property of the US Government, whether or not participants are selected to participate in the TIE events. As always, ACC is committed to safeguarding corporate proprietary information and intellectual property in accordance with FAR 3.104 and other regulations.<br />This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201 (b). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This notice is not a request for contractual offers. RFIs gather information from participants without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement. Information provided does not create a binding contract. There is no reimbursement to the RFI respondents for the information provided to HQ ACC. This announcement is a request for information from companies currently conducting IR&amp;D in relevant areas, not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research. Only those companies with demonstrated success in addressing Department of Defense capability development in their IR&amp;D programs should consider responding to this RFI. To be clear, invited organizations participating in TIEs do not receive any financial reimbursement from ACC or the Air Force. <br /><br />Contracting Office POC: <br />Marlese Yelardy<br />Contract Manager, PKB<br />Marlese.yelardy@us.af.mil <br />757-225-1583</p>

<DESC>Radar Electronic Countermeasure System Requirements Study<br />Request for Information (RFI)<br />December 2015
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. This RFI is for planning purposes only. This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.<br />Description<br />The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) is conducting this RFI to determine the availability and development status of technologies to support an airborne, Self-Protection Radar Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) system for both Rotary-Wing (RW) and Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA).<br />Future desired electronic warfare (EW) capabilities for Army Aviation are described in the US Army Functional Concept for Protection (2016-2028) and the US Army Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver (2016-2028). The government is investigating existing technologies that would compose a future advanced ECM system. The intent of this RFI is to determine the technical maturity of the systems, components, and algorithms suitable to counter current and future radar threats to Army airborne platforms. <br />In addition, the Army is interested in assessing novel, less mature technologies being developed for this or another purpose that may have application to the field of radar countermeasures and identifying candidate technologies for research and development investment. Miniaturization technologies are among the items of specific interest for airborne ECM applications. <br />The Army ECM system may have an integrated Electronic Support (ES) capability and/or utilize the existing APR-39D(V)2 Digital/Modernized Radar Warning Receiver for rotary-wing application. Open architecture systems are of particular interest, including compliance with Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE), Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA), and VICTORY. Solutions that do not meet all the requirements but have applicable components or technology will still be considered.<br />The information gathered will be used by the U.S. Army to generate requirements for the development of an Advanced RF ECM system (2020-2025).<br />Topics of Interest<br />Topics of interests should include:<br />&bull; Radar countermeasure technology with a development path to attain Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 within 5 years<br />&bull; Lower TRL radar countermeasure technology applicable to counter next generation RF threat systems, TRL 6 in 10 years<br />&bull; SWAP reduction strategies/miniaturization technology<br />&#8210; New and/or innovative application of advanced materials to improve RF ECM system performance (e.g. Gallium nitride (GaN))<br />&#8210; Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs)/Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)<br />&#8210; Heterogeneous integration of disparate semiconductors<br />&#8210; Additive manufacturing technologies<br />&bull; Adaptive or novel countermeasure algorithms and software that perform well in RF-dense environments<br />&bull; Detection and jamming of non-identified threats<br />&bull; New, novel, or alternative antenna architectures (specifically those suitable for airborne application)<br />TRL 6 Technology/System Characteristics:<br />&bull; Threat<br />&#8210; Address current and future threat technology<br />&#8210; Field-reprogrammable<br />&bull; Open Architecture <br />&#8210; Software defined<br />&#8210; Standard interfaces; FACE compliant<br />&#8210; Field-reprogrammable; unrestricted waveforms<br />&bull; Basic Air Platforms<br />&#8210; Rotary-Wing (RW) aircraft<br />&#61607; Be fully-integrated into the platform (no pod-mounted systems)<br />&#61607; Weigh no more than 100 lbs.<br />&#8210; Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA)<br />&#61607; May be pod-mounted<br />&#61607; Weigh no more than 200 lbs.<br />&bull; Other:<br />&#8210; Operate in dense electromagnetic (EM) spectrum<br />&#61607; Provide protection from intentional/unintentional emission<br />&#61607; Ensure protection from adversary EW/Cyber threats<br />&#8210; Embedded training<br />&#8210; Plan for mass-manufacturing/lifecycle support for next 30 years (no rare earth sourcing, parts obsolescence, etc.)<br />Responses<br />Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper and to fill out the attached excel form. The white paper submission shall be limited to 10 pages in length and provide additional detail to the excel form. Multiple submissions for different component technologies from the same vendor will be accepted. Submission of proprietary and other sensitive information shall be marked and identified with disposition instructions (submitted material will not be returned), and must be releasable to DoD contractors (NDA in place with CERDEC). Submissions not releasable to DoD contractors will not be evaluated. The responses shall include, but not be limited to: (a) a one page summary of the party's experience with the component technology, (b) a description of the party's technology solution, (c) a path to TRL 6 in 5-7 years meeting the listed requirements. The government will review the submitted responses and may schedule further discussions with responding vendors. Responders will be contacted individually. <br />All information is requested by 15 January 2016 via email to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-ewags-rfi@mail.mil. Questions may be directed to the aforementioned email address. If you choose to submit proprietary information, please mark it accordingly. Classified information is preferred to be submitted via SIPRNet to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-ewags-rfi@mail.smil.mil. If you do not have access to SIPRNet, request mailing instructions for a hard copy through the unclassified email address. Responses submitted by contractors that contain U.S. classified military information (CMI) generated in conjunction with a DOD program should be classified in accordance with the applicable SCG. Please include a copy of the SCG with the submission. Only U.S. citizens are authorized to respond to this RFI.<br />The government will review the submitted responses and may schedule further discussions with responding vendors. Responders will be contacted individually. Questions regarding this information request can be directed to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-ewags-rfi@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administrationâs (FAA) Enterprise Services Center (ESC) seeks information from private industry about providing Information Technology (IT) support services in a fee-for-service environment under a fixed price performance-based contract.  The responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this RFI; therefore, any cost associated with voluntary responses are solely at the interested vendors expense. 

NAICS Code: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541519, Other Computer Related Services with a size standard of $25.5 Million. 

1.0 BACKGROUND

The FAAâs Enterprise Services Center (ESC) is an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated Financial Shared Services Provider under the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) and Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLoB) programs.  

ESC is also a General Services Administration (GSA) accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).  In addition, ESC provides a full spectrum of IT services spanning application development, system hosting, disaster recovery and Help Desk.  ESC operates as a fee-for-service (franchise) organization, providing services to a multitude of federal agencies.  

2.0 IDENTIFIED REQUIREMENTS 

As a point of reference, at a high level, ESCâs IT services presently encompass:

     â¢	Enterprise Architecture (EA)
     â¢	Quality Assurance (QA) and Functional Testing
     â¢	Technical Writing
     â¢	Project Management
     â¢	Database Administration
     â¢	System/Application Development
     â¢	System/Application Administration
     â¢	Middle Tier Administration
     â¢	Infrastructure Design/Support
     â¢	Storage Area Network (SAN) / Network Attached Storage (NAS) Administration
     â¢	Network Design/Support
     â¢	Configuration Management
     â¢	Legacy Mainframe Application Support
     â¢	Information Systems Security
     â¢	Vulnerability Scanning/Remediation Tracking
     â¢	Operational Security Support
     â¢	Independent Assessments
 
3.0 PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT 

ESC is contemplating transitioning from an Indefinite Delivery Requirements (ID/R) contract with labor hour tasks to an ID/R performance-based contract with fixed price tasks.  The goals of this Request for Information are as follows: 

     â¢ Determine, in a federal, fee-for-service environment,   which particular IT support service areas are better suited for a performance-based contract (versus other contracting approaches);

     â¢ Identify if multiple vendors exist in the marketplace that have experience providing IT support services under a performance-based contract, to federal, fee-for-service organizations;

     â¢ Gain insights into vendor perspectives on performance-based contracting in the IT support services arena.

The FAA expects this RFI to provide a better understanding of potential benefits, perceived risks, lessons learned, recommendations and best practices from the use of a performance-based contract within a fee-for-service, IT services environment. 

The FAA anticipates the future procurement of an IT services contract utilizing a contracting methodology best suited for the IT support services that are not inherently governmental in function nor for which mission requirements dictate the tasks be performed by federal employees.

<CONTACT>Jimmy Vaughn, Information and Acq Managment Specialist, Phone 202-402-3602, Email Jvaughn@hudoig.gov - Robert Coyle, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 2024021458, Email Rcoyle@hudoig.gov
<DESC>Dec 14, 2015<br />To: Prospective Contractors<br />Attn: Government Contract Managers<br />Subject: Request for Information / Sources Sought regarding Caselaw Management Solutions (CMS) for Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General (HUDOIG)
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</p>
<p>The HUDOIG anticipates a need to obtain/sustain a Caselaw Management Solution (CMS) in support of its Office of Legal Counsel, Investigative and Audit mission, to include the consultation, development, and implementation of CMS, and all necessary training of the integrated solution. The HUDOIG is therefore seeking information as to the current state and offerings of the market.</p>
<p>HUDOIG further requests any interested Contractors identify applicable schedules (Such as GSA 76) or GWACs under which a prospective requirement could be met. Interested contractors should also identify appropriate NAICS codes and size standards for their products/services.</p>
<p>HUDOIG currently utilizes a combination of LexisNexis, Law PreDiscovery, Concordance, and Accurint Law Enforcement Plus, with a user base of approximately 30 concurrent network licenses, 30 maintenance licenses, 500 seats for Accurint, and 50 user licenses for the investigative reporting. The current solution is comprised of a two (2) Citrix based serves and ten (10) virtual workstations. The server operating systems are Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition with SQL as the database management system. While the existent infrastructure, its use is not a predetermined part of any solution.</p>
<p>The HUDOIG is seeking interested Schedule Holders provide a brief capability/information statement with regards to the points below. Specifically, the HUDOIG requests that interested parties provide information on or speak to:</p>
<p>1. HUDOIG requires access to tools that efficiently deliver searchable Caselaw research results, citatory information and services (including hotlinks), historical precedence. The Contractor shall speak to the components of their CMS solution, such as a Hardware/Software (Client Side)/Web Based. Traceability, currency, response time, and accuracy are key focuses. Additionally, access to a web services API may be requested. This enables the predictive analytics environment to include background, criminal, residential information into risk modeling. If this service is optional then we request information about what it entails including costing model. Query handling shall include batch processing which will allow for running large volumes of records (SSNs, phone #s, etc.) in an automated way (through an Excel spreadsheet, etc.), rather than having a user run the queries one at a time, though both options are preferred.</p>
<p><br />2. HUDOIG requires that the CMS support &lsquo;Field Operations' - - Investigators often have the need to search public records while in the field environment, in real time. HUDOIG requires that the tool be able assist in identifying personal and business assets, conflicts of interest, property ownership and location, background checks, histories on properties and criminal background searches to include identity, aliases, relatives, known associates, and work history or business interests that are public record, and that the tool be able to function in a mobile environment. Unavailability and/or a lack of mobility can jeopardize the ongoing field activities.</p>
<p>3. The CMS solution shall be fed by multiple sources and databases. As primary coverage, this shall include but not be limited to case law, statutory law, constitutions, administrative law, court rules, and other authority for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territory of Puerto Rico, as well as 18 federal law libraries. State and federal laws are covered for the past 70 years. As secondary coverage, this shall include shall include, but not be limited to links to Web-based documents and databases including state and federal statutes, rules, administrative law, forms, courts, executive agency materials, legislature materials, topic and practice area helpers, bar associations, news, and reference desk materials. Access to public files should include Public property or land ownership, bankruptcy filings, uniform commercial code filings, basic company information and their financial records. Timeframes for updates of information (i.e. 24 hour entry of new legal opinions) and update policy should be addressed.</p>
<p>4. Mobility Solution / Web Based Access - HUDOIG requires web based access - interested parties should speak to their web interface/capabilities, as well as secure access functionality and tracking/case management. HUDOIG is particularly interested in capabilities that allows for entering a client or case number so that accesses can be track to the time devoted to a client or case matter.<br /><br />5. Support, Licensing, and Updates - Interested Parties shall describe their licensing/update upgrade solution and policies (i.e. what is needed to add/remove seats, pricing policy and model (such as by seat or enterprise, mobile vs. fixed, etc). With regard to upgrades, the interested party shall speak to their upgrade intervals and planning, on Hardware/Software/Web as applicable.</p>
<p>6. Training Solution and Helpdesk Support - The interested party shall describe their typical training process for new clients/users, as well as identify normal help desk resources that would be available on a 24/7 basis.</p>
<p>7. Overall Reporting - The contractor shall identify their product's capabilities regarding overall management/dashboard tracking (number of reports generated, cases created, resources used, etc).</p>
<p>8. Implementation - Interested Parties shall speak to a typical implementation time for their CMS so referenced.</p>

The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. This RFI is not a guarantee of a future solicitation, work, or contract.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>SEW016 Lowell Creek Tunnel Repairs, Seward, Alaska<br /></strong>SOLICITATION NUMBER:W911KB-16-R-0008<br /><br /><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY FOR LOWELL CREEK TUNNEL REPAIRS, SEWARD, ALASKA.</strong> The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this acquisition lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources.<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</strong> Perform repairs of worn areas of Lowell Creek Tunnel which is an approximately 2,100 feet long tunnel through Bear Mountain on the southwest side of Seward, Alaska. The tunnel is a 10 feet high, horseshoe shaped tunnel which diverts Lowell Creek away from Seward, through Bear Mountain into Resurrection Bay. The tunnel is lined with concrete throughout. The floor and some of the side wall is armored with a combination of 40 pound and 70 pound railroad rails welded to channel crossties embedded in concrete. Water flow and debris have damaged the tunnel intake transition, tunnel entrance, tunnel sidewall and invert lining. Base contract work will occur within the top 400 feet of the tunnel and will include the following: remove loose concrete between the rails at the intake transition and replace with high strength silica fume concrete; remove loose concrete at exposed rebar at the tunnel entrance walls and roof and replace with high strength silica fume concrete and reestablish missing portions of reinforcement mat of #6 deformed bars; fill a large gouge in the tunnel side wall and adjacent floor and extend steel rail wall armoring by approximately 30 feet; and repair tunnel invert by securing loose rails, removing loose concrete and re-lining the invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Optional work will include re-lining the remainder of the tunnel invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Work will require diversion of Lowell Creek during repairs and will likely occur in the winter (no earlier than Winter 2016/2017) when stream flow is lowest. <br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Heavy and Other Civil Construction, and the related small business size standard is $37.5 Million.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />&bull; Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Alaska District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) on 1) FY 16 EIE365A F-35A Construct Flight Simulator, Eielson AFB AK, and 2) FY17 Design-Build FTW376 UAS Hangar, Fort Wainwright AK. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with the law. Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.
<p>In order to assist in the evaluation as to whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for either the FY 16 EIE365A F-35A Construct Flight Simulator, Eielson AFB AK OR FY17 Design-Build FTW376 UAS Hangar, Fort Wainwright AK, the Alaska District is soliciting information on historical use of PLAs in the Fairbanks area. Any interested party (contractors, project owners, contractor associations, labor unions, construction management firms, etc.) may respond. LETTERS SIMPLY INDICATING SUPPORT FOR OR OPPOSITION TO LABOR UNIONS AND/OR PLAs DO NOT OFFER ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Responses must include if they pertain to 1) FY 16 EIE365A F-35A Construct Flight Simulator, Eielson AFB AK OR 2) FY17 Design-Build FTW376 UAS Hangar, Fort Wainwright AK. Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What market share does union labor have in the Fairbanks geographical area?<br />(2) Are any Collective Bargaining Agreements expected to expire between December 2015 and December 2016?<br />(3) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings on the EIE365A or FTW376 project? How?<br />(4) Could a PLA minimize risk to the Government on the EIE365A or FTW376 project? How?<br />(5) Are there ways a PLA would increase costs on the EIE365A or FTW376 project? How?<br />(6) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor in the Fairbanks labor market? <br />(7) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(8) Have PLAs been used on private sector construction projects in the Fairbanks geographical area? If so, please provide the following details:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Project Name and Location<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Project Description<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Project Cost<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Was the project completed on time?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Number of craft trades present on the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; F.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Electrical Substation Data Logging
Northport, NY

PART 1. GENERAL INFORMATION:
A. INTRODUCTION:
The scope of this contract is to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the
cost estimate, purchase, installation and training of an electrical data logging system for
the 5 electrical utility feeders in the Northport VAMC electrical substation in building
209 located at the Northport VAMC.

B. BACKGROUND:
B.1. Electrical power is fed into the Northport campus via two utility feeds. One from the
Northport (Elwood) feed and the other is from the Indian Head (Pulaski) feed. The
VAMC segregates power from the two substations to five campus electrical feeders.
2 feeders, "B" and "C" are fed from the Indian Head (Pulaski) feed. 3 feeders, "A",
"D" and "E" are fed from the Northport (Elwood) feed.
B.1. The substation is set up so that in the event of a power failure from one of the power
stations, the circuit breakers in the substation can be switched from either open to
closed or closed to open across a main tie breaker, which would allow power from
one substation to traverse the tie breaker and feed the failed side with electricity while
not pushing power back out to the grid. The key here is that the circuit breaker from
the failed side must be open to disallow electricity flow back out onto the grid until
PSEG has corrected the problem and energized the incoming line again. While the
system is currently configured to manually perform this action, new switchgear is in
design to automatically switch the circuit breakers on and off correctly through
another project.
B.2. The future project that will replace the current substation, which is over 40 years old,
with an entirely new substation is set to begin sometime in 2016. But to do this,
Northport VAMC's electric utility provider, PSEG needs to tell the VA what type of
protective gear the VA needs to place on the upstream side of the line to make sure
we protect the local electrical feeds that distribute power to the Northport VAMC
campus.
B.3. The data that PSEG and Northport VAMC will need to design the upstream utility
protection and downstream (on-campus) utility distribution requires real-time
electrical data from each of the 5 electrical feeders (A, B, C, D and E). This data
needs to be gathered on each of the three electrical legs in each feeder as electricity is
sent out into the campus.

C. SCOPE:
C.1. GENERAL:
The contractor shall purchase, install and train Northport VAMC personnel on the
Schneider Electric EGX300 Integrated Gateway Server electrical data logger.
C.2. REQUIREMENTS:
C.2.1. One or more data loggers need to be installed to collect data output by the Square D
(Schneider Electric) Series 2000 - Power Logic Circuit Monitors that are residing on
each of the 5 electrical substation feeders (A, B, C, D and E) located in building 209.
The data logger must be seamlessly compatible with Power Logic Circuit Monitors.
C.2.2. The Schneider Electric EGX300 - Integrated Gateway Server is the recommended
data logging unit to use.
C.2.3. The Circuit Monitors located on each electrical feeder shall be serially wired across
the RS485 onboard circuitry. The wires shall pass between electrical cabinet either
through pre-existing open pathway or through installed through-hull electrical
connectors. On the last Circuit monitor, the RS485 wires shall be connected to the
Schneider Electric EGX300.
C.2.4. The Schneider Electric EGX300 shall be mounted on the outside face of the campus
feeder closest to the west door of the substation to allow access to the Ethernet port in
such a way that an Ethernet cable can connect to the EGX300 periodically to
download data.
C.2.5. A 20' Ethernet cable will also be supplied by the contractor.
C.2.6. The contractor will have previous knowledge of Schneider software.
C.2.7. The contractor will provide training to Energy Manager and VA Northport
Electricians on how to retrieve data via Ethernet connection.

PART 2. WORK REQUIREMENTS:
A. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
A.1. POWER LOGIC ETHERNET GATEWAY EGX300:
A.1.1. Installation:
A.1.1.1. Install at least 1 x Power Logic Ethernet Gateway EGX300 on the proximal (closest)
campus electrical feeder. Do not install on the utility feed cabinets labeled
"Northport" or "IndianHead".
A.1.1.2. Connect EGX300 to Square D Power Logic Circuit Monitor via RS485 wires in serial
fashion. Follow Power Logic Ethernet Gatway EGX300 Installation Guide 63230-
319-212A1 directions. Use Belden 8723 or 9842 wiring for serial connections.
A.1.1.3. Access setup menu via Ethernet connection by typing address 169.254.0.10 into
internet interface software (Internet Explorer, Safari, FireFox or Chrome). Setup
logging on EGX300 to acquire data at a minimum of 15 minute intervals. Minimum
logged data must include voltage and current of each campus feeder (A, B, C, D and
E) on 15 minute intervals. Ideally, Northport would like to log the voltage and
current of each leg of wire in each campus feeder on 5 minute intervals.
A.1.1.4. Follow Power Logic Ethernet Gateway EGX300 User's Guide for correct setup.
Document # 63230-319-216A1.
A.1.1.5. Verify EGX300 is properly recording data via Ethernet cable data download into MS
Excel format.
A.1.2 Training
Contractor shall train VA Northport energy manager and electricians on data retrieval

PART 3. SUPPORTING INFORMATION:
A. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:
A.1 WORK PERFORMANCE LOCATION:
VAMC Northport
Building 209 - Electrical Substation
76 Middleville Rd.
Northport, NY 11768

B. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
The Government estimates that the design specified in this Statement of Work shall
be performed within 10 calendar days after receiving the award/ notice to proceed.
Construction Administration Services will be determined at time of Construction
award.

C. SECURITY:
C.1. The A/E shall follow all Government rules and regulations regarding information
security to prevent disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals or
organizations.
C.2. VA Handbook 6500.3 defines the procedures for Certification and Accreditation
(C&A) of VA Information Systems. C&A is the process used to ensure information
systems including major Applications (MA) and General Support Systems (GSS)
have effective safeguards which have been implemented, planned for, and
documented in a system security plan as commensurate with potential risks to the
system's information. Since this acquisition will not require services that involve
connection of one or more A/E-owned IT devices (such as a laptop computer or
remote connection from a A/E system) to a VA internal trusted (i.e. non-public)
network, C&A requirements do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package will
not be required.
C.3. A/E staff and management may have access to some privileged and confidential
materials of the United States Government such as budget and strategic plans. These
printed and electronic documents are for internal use only, are not to be copied or
released without permission, and remain the sole property of the United States
Government. Some of these materials may be protected by the Privacy Act of 1974
(revised by PL 93-5791) and Title 18. Unauthorized disclosure of Privacy Act or Title
18 covered materials is a criminal offense.

<p>The NCTR, Division of Neurotoxicology requires an experimental AD drugs to be used for animal (rat) dosing of transgenic (Tg) mice. These drugs are characterized as containing therapeutic and toxicological properties. The purpose is to administer them to an AD/Tg mice population with Alzheimer's disease and the subsequent use of in vitro and in vivo imaging methods to characterize the drug compound's efficacy and toxicity. The drugs will be used in a new type of breeding colony at NCTR, AD/Tg rat strain. This animal is an important model that exhibits all the pathological features commonly seen in humans with AD (Alzheimer's Disease). It is hoped that this model will provide improved understanding of disease development and progression enabling the identification of new biomarkers of the disease and new drug targets.</p>
<p>Transgenic mice have been used to study Alzheimer's disease, but none of them show complete spectrum of AD pathology. The purpose of this protocol is to establish a breeding colony of a genetically engineered rat model of AD to study whether individual components of the metabolic syndrome impact the neurovascular units and associated cerebro-vascular integrity in an animal model of AD. This model has potential to significantly impact FDA science and regulatory policy and will serve to highlight its use as a replacement for currently used models. The above custom-made experimental drug compounds are required for this study.</p>

The salient characteristics of the items above are listed below.
Salient Characteristics:
1.	Device must utilize fiber-optic IABP and catheter system that automatically calibrates in the patient after insertion and automatically recalibrates in vivo every 2 hours or sooner, should the patient or environmental conditions change.
2.	Device must utilize the Sensation Plus 50cc IAB to be utilized with the CardioSave IABP. The Sensation Plus is the only 50cc IAB that can be used on patients 5'4" and up. This IAB provides increased hemodynamic support.
3.	Must have lithium ion batteries which offer potentially unlimited run-time with spare batteries.
4.	Must have state-of the- art LCD panels which are used for both the upper waveform display and lower touchscreen control. This allows for larger patient display parameters, improved help screen navigation and customizable control screens. The backlit screen allows visibility in varying lighting conditions with no alternate light source.
5.	Must have enhanced pneumatics which helps optimize diastolic augmentation. Faster pneumatic speed allows the balloon to stay inflated longer during diastole.
6.	Must have enhanced pacer detection.
7.	Must be able to provide loaner pumps as needed and must guarantee that a pump will be delivered within 4 hours.    
8.	Must provide a clinical support line for staff to call when there are questions with the pump when a patient is receiving treatment.  Most of these calls are emergent and the staff needs quick response to their questions.  This support must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  
9.	Must provide field service capability where representatives are deployed locally to the facility.  Services must be performed on-site by certified technicians, including scheduled preventative maintenance.
10.	Balloon pumps must be helium pressure based.
11.	When a patient codes, the device must automatically go into pressure mode for uninterrupted treatment of the patient.

The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price award.  Responses to the solicitation shall be due on Thursday, December 17, 2015 at 9:00AM PST.  Offerers are advised to review and monitor the website to ensure you have the most up to date information, including amendments.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only Request for Quote (RFQ). Written quotes are being requested. A hardcopy written RFQ will not be issued.
<p>The&nbsp;National Marine Fisheries, Office of Law Enforcement division located in Juneau, Alaska, has a requirement to replace the existing engines on the Law Enforcement Patrol Vessel due to them having reached the end of their service life. We require full service removal of the old engines and successful installation of two new, counter-rotating, MERCURY MARINE VERADO four stroke engines.</p>
<p>A request for quote is issued for two (2) BRAND NAME MERCURY MARINE VERADO <br />four stroke engines includes accessories and installation, as follows:</p>
<p>1) ONE (1 ) EACH 225XL VERADO FOURSTROKE MFR PART NO.:1225V23BD<br />2) ONE (1) EACH 225CXL VERADO FOURSTROKE MFR PART NO.:1225V24BD<br />3) THREE (3) PROPELLERS ONE INSTALLED AND ONE SPARE FOR EACH COUNTER-ROTATING ENGINE AND ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT AWARD<br />4) ALL CABLES/MODULES AND PARTS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL REMOVAL OF THE OLD ENGINES AND INSTALL OF THE NEW ENGINES <br />5) ALL LABOR FOR SUCCESSFUL REMOVAL OF THE OLD ENGINES AND INSTALLATION OF THE NEW ENGINES.<br /><br />All quotes must be FOB destination, NMFS Alaska Enforcement Division 709 West 9th Street Juneau, Alaska 99801. The required delivery date is 30 days ARO.</p>
<p>The MERCURY MARINE VERADO four stroke engine is the engine that meets all our requirements. This engine uses the same wire harness and controls already installed on our NOAA boat the Aleutian Wind. The second engine is a counter rotating engine. These motors are NOAA OLE Mission Critical items for the Juneau Enforcement office. Without these motors, NOAA OLE will not be able to cover the high interest Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>Current needs require two outboard motors that don't exceed the NOAA OLE patrol vessel's transom weight restriction of 1,050 lbs., has enough horse power to efficiently perform at sea patrols, 4 stroke that is more environmentally friendly (not burning 2 stroke oil), can safely with reliability operate on one motor if the other fails to work and can be repaired or have routine maintenance performed locally.</p>
<p>This is 100% set-aside to small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 333618 with a size standard of 1000 employees.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide the NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment (CWD) resilient and full-spectrum cyber warfare capabilities for Naval aircraft, weapons and related Naval aviation systems. This effort is being posted to include this NAICS Code. Please refer to the original posting, which is being synopsized under PSC code 7010 and NAICS code 541512 under Solicitation number N68335-16-R-0075A.
<p>Original Synopsis:<br />The NAVAIR CWD develops and assesses cyber warfare capabilities for mission assurance of Naval aircraft and weapon systems (aircraft, unmanned vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.) and Naval aircraft support systems (data processing, data links, networks, communications, navigation, mission planning, aviation support equipment, aircraft launch and recovery equipment, maintenance &amp; logistic systems and connections to enterprise/business systems). The strategy of the NAVAIR CWD is to defend the access points to our weapon systems (detect, prevent), survive and continue to operate during enemy engagement, and foster future cyber-hardened acquisition (resilience and response). The CWD is seeking both traditional DoD contractor sources and non-traditional sources in support of its strategy to develop the NAVAIR cyber workforce, improve infrastructure, conduct research &amp; development (R&amp;D), implement the Navy CYBERSAFE program and the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF), conduct Cyber Risk Assessments (CRAs), support Naval Aviation Programs of Record with cyber solutions and full spectrum cyber capabilities, and establish standards and best practices for incorporation into future acquisitions. <br />BOAs will be issued with companies in the 6 distinct industry pools as defined below.</p>
<p>Pool #1: System definition &amp; architecture development<br />Pool #2: Risk assessments and assessment methods<br />Pool #3: Develop and conduct Cyber Workforce training<br />Pool #4: Cyber penetration testing and penetration tool development<br />Pool #5: Protection solutions and system integration services<br />Pool #6: Full spectrum operational cyber warfare support</p>
<p>Specific desired capabilities within each pool can be found in Attachment 1. Future orders will be competed among existing BOA holders within each of these pools at the time of the Request for Proposal (RFP). Companies may be qualified to compete in one or more pools.</p>
<p>A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. See Attachment 2. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to award of contract<br />Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable. BOAs will be issued to firms that can support the following parameters: A firm must demonstrate both timely and relevant experience in one or more of the pools of this synopsis. Contractors shall submit the above information as part of their experience statements for both the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors (if applicable). Experience shall be evaluated for acceptability on a pass/fail basis based on contractor's experience. The Government will consider both the timeliness and the relevancy of the experience data based on the scope of the BOA as described above. To be considered timely, the experience must have occurred within the past 3 years at the time the response is received. To be considered relevant, the contractor must demonstrate execution of work that aligns with the desired capabilities in Attachment 1. For each prior work experience, contractors shall identify which pool or pools of work for which they believe they have previously demonstrated. The Government reserves the right to contact the listed points of contact for each reference to verify the information submitted. <br />The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. BOAs will be issued for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide the NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment (CWD) resilient and full-spectrum cyber warfare capabilities for Naval aircraft, weapons and related Naval aviation systems. This effort is being posted to include this NAICS Code. Please refer to the original posting, which is being synopsized under PSC code 7010 and NAICS code 541512 under Solicitation number N68335-16-R-0075A.
<p>Original Synopsis:<br />The NAVAIR CWD develops and assesses cyber warfare capabilities for mission assurance of Naval aircraft and weapon systems (aircraft, unmanned vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.) and Naval aircraft support systems (data processing, data links, networks, communications, navigation, mission planning, aviation support equipment, aircraft launch and recovery equipment, maintenance &amp; logistic systems and connections to enterprise/business systems). The strategy of the NAVAIR CWD is to defend the access points to our weapon systems (detect, prevent), survive and continue to operate during enemy engagement, and foster future cyber-hardened acquisition (resilience and response). The CWD is seeking both traditional DoD contractor sources and non-traditional sources in support of its strategy to develop the NAVAIR cyber workforce, improve infrastructure, conduct research &amp; development (R&amp;D), implement the Navy CYBERSAFE program and the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF), conduct Cyber Risk Assessments (CRAs), support Naval Aviation Programs of Record with cyber solutions and full spectrum cyber capabilities, and establish standards and best practices for incorporation into future acquisitions. <br />BOAs will be issued with companies in the 6 distinct industry pools as defined below.</p>
<p>Pool #1: System definition &amp; architecture development<br />Pool #2: Risk assessments and assessment methods<br />Pool #3: Develop and conduct Cyber Workforce training<br />Pool #4: Cyber penetration testing and penetration tool development<br />Pool #5: Protection solutions and system integration services<br />Pool #6: Full spectrum operational cyber warfare support</p>
<p>Specific desired capabilities within each pool can be found in Attachment 1. Future orders will be competed among existing BOA holders within each of these pools at the time of the Request for Proposal (RFP). Companies may be qualified to compete in one or more pools.</p>
<p>A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. See Attachment 2. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to award of contract<br />Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable. BOAs will be issued to firms that can support the following parameters: A firm must demonstrate both timely and relevant experience in one or more of the pools of this synopsis. Contractors shall submit the above information as part of their experience statements for both the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors (if applicable). Experience shall be evaluated for acceptability on a pass/fail basis based on contractor's experience. The Government will consider both the timeliness and the relevancy of the experience data based on the scope of the BOA as described above. To be considered timely, the experience must have occurred within the past 3 years at the time the response is received. To be considered relevant, the contractor must demonstrate execution of work that aligns with the desired capabilities in Attachment 1. For each prior work experience, contractors shall identify which pool or pools of work for which they believe they have previously demonstrated. The Government reserves the right to contact the listed points of contact for each reference to verify the information submitted. <br />The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. BOAs will be issued for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, NAVAIR may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms must review the BOA template and indicate their ability and agreement to comply with all of the terms and conditions as stated. Contractors must have representations and certifications registered on the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov.<br />Contractors shall submit an Experience Statement (Attachment 3) for each relevant experience. Responses should reference solicitation number N68335-16-R-0075. Experience Statements must be submitted electronically to Jane Worley, E-mail: jane.worley@navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide the NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment (CWD) resilient and full-spectrum cyber warfare capabilities for Naval aircraft, weapons and related Naval aviation systems. This effort is being posted to include this NAICS Code. Please refer to the original posting, which is being synopsized under PSC code 7010 and NAICS code 541512 under Solicitation number N68335-16-R-0075A.
<p>Original Synopsis:<br />The NAVAIR CWD develops and assesses cyber warfare capabilities for mission assurance of Naval aircraft and weapon systems (aircraft, unmanned vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.) and Naval aircraft support systems (data processing, data links, networks, communications, navigation, mission planning, aviation support equipment, aircraft launch and recovery equipment, maintenance &amp; logistic systems and connections to enterprise/business systems). The strategy of the NAVAIR CWD is to defend the access points to our weapon systems (detect, prevent), survive and continue to operate during enemy engagement, and foster future cyber-hardened acquisition (resilience and response). The CWD is seeking both traditional DoD contractor sources and non-traditional sources in support of its strategy to develop the NAVAIR cyber workforce, improve infrastructure, conduct research &amp; development (R&amp;D), implement the Navy CYBERSAFE program and the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF), conduct Cyber Risk Assessments (CRAs), support Naval Aviation Programs of Record with cyber solutions and full spectrum cyber capabilities, and establish standards and best practices for incorporation into future acquisitions. <br />BOAs will be issued with companies in the 6 distinct industry pools as defined below.</p>
<p>Pool #1: System definition &amp; architecture development<br />Pool #2: Risk assessments and assessment methods<br />Pool #3: Develop and conduct Cyber Workforce training<br />Pool #4: Cyber penetration testing and penetration tool development<br />Pool #5: Protection solutions and system integration services<br />Pool #6: Full spectrum operational cyber warfare support</p>
<p>Specific desired capabilities within each pool can be found in Attachment 1. Future orders will be competed among existing BOA holders within each of these pools at the time of the Request for Proposal (RFP). Companies may be qualified to compete in one or more pools.</p>
<p>A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. See Attachment 2. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to award of contract<br />Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable. BOAs will be issued to firms that can support the following parameters: A firm must demonstrate both timely and relevant experience in one or more of the pools of this synopsis. Contractors shall submit the above information as part of their experience statements for both the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors (if applicable). Experience shall be evaluated for acceptability on a pass/fail basis based on contractor's experience.

<p>The Contractor must submit its quotation via email to Rachel.Dobbs@psa.gov Eastern Standard time December 21, 2015 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p><br />E.2 QUOTATION FORMAT</p>
<p>Offeror's may submit their quotations in a format customary to their normal business practices provided:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotations must be submitted in PDF Format, printable on standard 8 &frac12;" X 11" paper.<br />&bull; Quotations must clearly identify the product manufacture, part numbers, and other identifying information to allow the Government to verify the quotation complies with the minimum standard specifications stated in the Schedule (Section B).<br />&bull; Quotation must clearly identify the period of performance.</p>
<p>E.3 BASIS OF AWARD</p>
<p>Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors (Lowest Price/Technically Acceptable). To be considered technically acceptable, the Offeror's quote will be reviewed to determine if the product(s) offered meet the Governments stated minimum requirements or objectives. The evaluation criteria used shall be either ACCEPTABLE or NOT ACCEPTABLE. If the proposed product(s) meet the stated minimum requirements, it will be rated ACCETABLE. If the proposed product(s) do not meet the stated minimum requirements, it will be rated NOT ACCEPTABLE. In the event an offeror's quote is determined to be NOT ACCEPTABLE, the offeror will be notified of the reason(s).</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>E4. POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without communications if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer is fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary. The Government may, at the discretion of the Contacting Officer, enter into communications if warranted.</p>
<p>E.5 ALTERNATE PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Alternate proposals will not be considered.</p>
<p>E.6 EVALUATION</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA)</p>
<p><br />The Offeror's proposal is presumed to represent an Offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. The Government will perform a price analysis on the proposed prices to determine price reasonableness. Determination of price reasonableness may include, but is not limited to, determining if 1) the costs are realistic for the work to be performed, 2) reflect a clear understanding of the contract requirements, and 3) are inclusive of all services requested.</p>
<p>The Government may determine that an Offeror's price proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, one or more contract line items significantly overstated or understated by the application of price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determined that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement.

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to mitchell.a.robison@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of proposals.</p>

Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact. The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted to the Purchasing Agent, Deborah Sosa, not the Accounts Receivable Officer, or the "ship to" office.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The twenty-four (24) hours of a Federal holiday do not count against this response requirement. 

â¢	If the repair results in an âawaiting partsâ status, the forty-eight (48) hour response time restarts when the part is received.

End of SOW Section

The following text has been copied from the original announcement below and is being provided here with a new submission due date, a new question point of contact and a new due date for questions. 

All Submissions must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 13, 2016.  Submission must include company Point(s) of Contact, telephone number(s), FAX number(s), E-mail address(es) (if available), and mailing address.

*** 

REQUIREMENT:

The FAA has a current requirement for the acquisition, installation, maintenance and training support of X-Ray Package Screening Systems at approximately 50 locations throughout the continental United States.  Vendors are requested to demonstrate experience and capabilities of providing maintenance and training for X-Ray Package Screening Systems.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Revised X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work, attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

The FAA anticipates that any resultant contract will be Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity with Firm Fixed Price CLINs and one Corrective Maintenance Labor Hour CLIN.  Any such contract is further anticipated to be have a base period of performance of one (1) year and four (1) year option periods.

At this time the nature of any competition that may result from this market survey has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of an anticipated procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334517 with a size standard of 500 employees.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages, excluding the Business Declaration form and SBA certification documentation. No type font less than 11 point may be used.

PURPOSE:	
This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:

The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.

In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

a. Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the Revised X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work)

b. Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)

c. Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

ATTACHMENTS: 
a. Revised X-Ray Screening Systems Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work
b. Business Declaration Form

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administrationâs (FAA) Enterprise Services Center (ESC) seeks information from private industry about providing Information Technology (IT) support services in a fee-for-service environment under a fixed price performance-based contract.  The responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this RFI; therefore, any cost associated with voluntary responses are solely at the interested vendors expense. 

NAICS Code: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541519, Other Computer Related Services with a size standard of $25.5 Million. 

1.0 BACKGROUND

The FAAâs Enterprise Services Center (ESC) is an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated Financial Shared Services Provider under the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) and Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLoB) programs.  

ESC is also a General Services Administration (GSA) accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).  In addition, ESC provides a full spectrum of IT services spanning application development, system hosting, disaster recovery and Help Desk.  ESC operates as a fee-for-service (franchise) organization, providing services to a multitude of federal agencies.  

2.0 IDENTIFIED REQUIREMENTS 

As a point of reference, at a high level, ESCâs IT services presently encompass:

     â¢	Enterprise Architecture (EA)
     â¢	Quality Assurance (QA) and Functional Testing
     â¢	Technical Writing
     â¢	Project Management
     â¢	Database Administration
     â¢	System/Application Development
     â¢	System/Application Administration
     â¢	Middle Tier Administration
     â¢	Infrastructure Design/Support
     â¢	Storage Area Network (SAN) / Network Attached Storage (NAS) Administration
     â¢	Network Design/Support
     â¢	Configuration Management
     â¢	Legacy Mainframe Application Support
     â¢	Information Systems Security
     â¢	Vulnerability Scanning/Remediation Tracking
     â¢	Operational Security Support
     â¢	Independent Assessments
 
3.0 PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT 

ESC is contemplating transitioning from an Indefinite Delivery Requirements (ID/R) contract with labor hour tasks to an ID/R performance-based contract with fixed price tasks.  The goals of this Request for Information are as follows: 

     â¢ Determine, in a federal, fee-for-service environment,   which particular IT support service areas are better suited for a performance-based contract (versus other contracting approaches);

     â¢ Identify if multiple vendors exist in the marketplace that have experience providing IT support services under a performance-based contract, to federal, fee-for-service organizations;

     â¢ Gain insights into vendor perspectives on performance-based contracting in the IT support services arena.

The FAA expects this RFI to provide a better understanding of potential benefits, perceived risks, lessons learned, recommendations and best practices from the use of a performance-based contract within a fee-for-service, IT services environment. 

The FAA anticipates the future procurement of an IT services contract utilizing a contracting methodology best suited for the IT support services that are not inherently governmental in function nor for which mission requirements dictate the tasks be performed by federal employees.

4.0 INSTRUCTIONS

Responses, submitted electronically in MS-Word or Adobe PDF format, are limited six (6) pages excluding a completed Business Declaration, using 12 point Times New Roman font (or similar) with 1 inch margins.  Responses are due no later than 5:00 P.M. (CST) on January 8, 2016. All interested parties must submit their responses via email to monica.price@faa.gov.  Questions must be in writing.

C. Specific Service Areas Addressed by the IT Support Services
Describe which areas of IT were addressed by the performance-based contract your company provided services under, to include:
     â¢ Name of the federal agency for which services were provided

     â¢ IT service areas addressed by the contract

Please identify if your experience correlates with the list provided in paragraph 2.0.  Areas or tasks relate where a contractor does not have prior experience should also be annotated as such.

Describe actual or perceived benefits (to both parties) recognized by your company while providing IT services under a performance-based contract.

E. Performance-based Contracting â Perceived Risks
Describe actual or perceived risks (to either party) recognized by your company while providing IT services under a performance-based contact.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  
The FAA is seeking innovations for providing aeronautical charting information to the general public using new technology and processes.  Currently, this requirement is fulfilled using the traditional lithographic printing process.   The FAA is seeking commercial industry solutions to provide a variety of aeronautical charts. The aeronautical charts are used by commercial airlines, private pilots, and the United States Air Force (USAF) for aeronautical navigational purposes. See the attached draft Statement of Objectives for more details. 

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this event is to gather information about vendor capabilities and interest in providing print-on-demand platforms for aeronautical charts.  In the first morning session, an informative presentation will be conducted by the government. In the afternoon, the government will allow interested vendors the opportunity to provide a one-on-one capability briefing. Capability briefings shall be limited to no more than 30 minutes per company.

REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
To register for this event, send a completed registration form (attachment) to the primary POC, the Contracting Officer, Monica Price, at email address monica.price@faa.gov. Registration must be received and confirmed no later than 5:00pm EST May 22, 2015. Please note that space is limited. Only advanced registered attendees may attend this event. No more than three (3) representatives per company will be permitted and seating is limited to the first 25 people registered. 

NOTE:
This Industry Day is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal, nor as a contract or commitment of any kind, nor as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested market research information, capability briefings or other documentation submitted as part of your voluntary participation in this industry day.  Costs of travel shall not be reimbursed to attendees, and there is no entitlement to payment by the FAA of direct or indirect costs or charges that are incurred as a result of submission of responses to this Industry Day announcement and/or attendance to the Industry Day event.

The resources may be used in the protection of lands, to include but not be limited to, severity, fire suppression and all-hazard incidents.  These agreements may be used by Federal and State Agencies located within the Intermountain (Great Basin) Region.  Proposed rates shall include, but are not limited to, labor (as required), equipment, operating supplies, materials, State and Federal taxes (including workers compensation costs), insurance coverage, transportation costs, overhead, and profit, and any costs/fees necessary to ensure equipment/operators/crews meet(s) the specified standards. As required by the agreement, any costs associated with a contractor provided support truck for fuel, maintenance, and operator transportation; delivery/setup/takedown, mobilization/demobilization, power generation, and a Contractors representative attendance at the operational period briefings should also be included.  Awards will not be made to vendors designating equipment City and State location more than 450 miles away from their selected Dispatch Center (under Section D.5.1 of the solicitation) within their quote.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple preseason Incident Blanket Purchase Agreements (I-BPAs) using a total Small Business set aside under NAICS 115310 with further consideration for HUBZone small business and Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB).

Reminder: Award is not guaranteed.  Any documented attempt to receive Government award through submittal of fraudulent vendor supporting documentation or fraudulent company information during the VIPR quote process will indicate a lack of business integrity or business honesty and will be considered grounds for a request of suspension and debarment of violating company.  No award will be made and a record will be created for future award determinations.  The Government will award a number of I-BPAs anticipated to meet incident resource needs resulting from this solicitation to responsible quoters whose quotes conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  See B.3 -- BASIS OF AWARD within the solicitation.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) Operational acceptability of equipment/resource offered to meet the Government requirement. (2) Price reasonableness (Price reasonableness may be based upon competition, government estimates, commercial pricing, historical data, etc.).  Price reasonableness is a local Government-determined range and is considered both confidential and non-negotiable. (3) Past performance dependability risk.  This solicitation will be available electronically only and will be posted to the FedBizOpps website at https://www.fbo.gov on or about December 14, 2015. Electronic responses must be transmitted in the VIPR Vendor Application by 4:00 P.M. MST, January 29, 2016.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.
<p>The Civil Rights and Diversity Office (CRDO) promotes accessibility for employees and visitors. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, require the Government to provide reasonable accommodation to employees, applicants and visitors. Reasonable accommodation can include, but is not limited to, providing sign language services. Sign language services are provided so that manually communicating employees or visitors who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can participate equally in all facets of their employment or visit at NIST.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four deaf employees who require sign language services on a regular basis for meetings, trainings, and other events. Additionally, NIST hosts a variety of events (such as tours, colloquium talks, conferences and meetings) which are open to the public and may require sign language services. NIST plans to utilize Contractors to provide sign language services on an "as needed" basis to meet requirements, which may vary widely.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to provide expressive and receptive sign language services for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Services may be required at NIST campuses located in Gaithersburg, MD, Boulder, Colorado, and/or Charleston, SC. It is anticipated that the majority of services will be provided on-site at the Gaithersburg, MD campus. Services may also be required at venues other than the NIST campus.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is <strong>541930&nbsp;with a small business size standard of&nbsp;$7.5 million.</strong> Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority&nbsp;of FAR Parts 12 and 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for women-owned small business. Award of multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements are anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-15-RQ-0544.</p>
<p>Potential quoters shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately four (4) days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001:<br />N00164-16-S-NB16 - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - BATTLEFIELD LASER TRACKER AND DESIGNATOR (BLTD) - FSC: 5855 - NAICS: 333314<br />Issue Date: 10 DEC 2015 - Closing Date: 10 JAN 2016 - 2:00 PM EDST
<p><br />AMENDMENT 0001 -<br />Response to Industry Questions:<br />1. Is the "pickup truck" target 1.4 meter x 1.7 meter? Is there a reflectivity for the pickup for the three lasers?</p>
<p>- Response - 1.4 m x 1.7 m is an acceptable, representative size for a pickup truck. Reflectance is already listed in the laser detection portion of the RFI.</p>
<p><br />2. Is 3000 meters recognition range and spot detection for all three lasers threshold for night, or is this a desired/objective requirement? Thinking of the size of the required optics.</p>
<p>- Response - We are interested in information concerning the tradeoffs between 3km detection and 3 km recognition. There are no thresholds/objectives at this time.</p>
<p><br />3. NIR Spot Detection. Is the day detection required, or artifact of cut and paste? Is the laser CW or pulsed (at 4Hz, 50% duty cycle)?</p>
<p>- Response - NIR spot detection should have been written as night-only. Laser should be thought of as CW.</p>
<p><br />4. SWIR Spot Detection. Is the day detection required, or artifact of cut and paste? Is the laser CW or pulsed (at 4Hz, 50% duty cycle)?</p>
<p>- Response - SWIR spot detection should have been written as night-only. Laser should be thought of as CW.</p>
<p><br />5. Interface. Are there messages and formats you will share with industry? Or is this more TBD, or as it evolves?</p>
<p>- Response - The original idea behind the display of information was laser PRF code. The original idea behind accepting information was a trigger from the laser to assist the BLT with detection. This idea could evolve to include more.</p>
<p><br />6. Other. Is there a desired battery (CR123, L91, Alkaline AA...)?</p>
<p>- Response - This information was not requested.</p>
<p><br />7. Run time?</p>
<p>- Response - If you feel there are important trade-offs concerning run time that are relevant to this RFI, you are encouraged to include them in your response.</p>
<p><br />Regarding Designator</p>
<p>1. PRF Codes. Assume it must support all Band I/II NATO Codes, but what about PIM codes? Lasers "can do PIM" but to date, no documentation for the I/O, data storage, etc requirements has been provided to support them.</p>
<p>- Response - Information concerning PIM codes is not requested as part of this RFI. If you feel there is an important trade-off concerning the inclusion or exclusion of PIM codes, you are encouraged to address that in your response.</p>
<p><br />2. GUI/MMI. Any amplification on how much/little is desired? Is an HLM like MMI desired, or something like EJTAC LTD? How much of designators info needs to go to the BLT?</p>
<p>- Response - Information concerning GUI or MMI is not relevant to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />3. Range finding, desired not desired? Value of "first" return comes to mind quickly.</p>
<p>- Response - If you feel there are important trade-offs concerning range finding that are relevant to this RFI, you are encouraged to include them in your response.</p>
<p><br />4. Azimuth finding, desired not desired?</p>
<p>- Response - Azimuth finding is not relevant to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />5. Independent use. Is the intention to only use the designator when it is paired with the BLT, or does it need an included aiming capability (iron sight, DVO, other)?</p>
<p>- Response - The RFI response should not include information about an aiming capability inherent to the Designator.</p>
<p><br />6. Batteries. Desired batteries? CR123 is a typical default, but that it has challenges with cold temps.</p>
<p>- Response - If you feel there are important trade-offs related to battery type that are relevant to this RFI you are encouraged to include them in your response.</p>
<p><br />7. Run time and duty cycle at 20 Hz?</p>
<p>- Response - If you feel there are important trade-offs concerning run time and duty cycle that are relevant to this RFI, you are encouraged to include them in your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General questions / comments</p>
<p>1. Anything you can share on this being/becoming a Program of Record, funding plan, request for tech demos, etc.? Timelines?</p>
<p>-Response- No comment.</p>
<p><br />2. Pricing. Industry is very hard pressed to provide pricing in any response with less than 60 days advance notice due to internal review processes.</p>
<p>- Response - A valuable part of this market research is ROM pricing. If, however, you are unable to provide ROM pricing, you are still encouraged to submit a response.</p>
<p><br />3. Assume it is okay to respond to either or both the BLT and/or the D portion of the RFI?</p>
<p>- Response - Yes.</p>
<p><br />MARKET SURVEY - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SYNOPSIS: The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) is seeking information for market research purposes relative to technologies available to support observation, laser spot tracking, and PRF-coded laser designation systems to be used day and night in nearly all weather conditions to designate targets during "call-for-fire" missions using laser guided munitions.

<DESC>Region 5 has been one of the front running regions to employ comparative monitoring LDAR investigations at chemical plants, refineries, and natural gas extraction plants.  The core violation found is the improper use of EPA Reference Method 21, and this is primarily determined using Flame Ionization Detectors from our Toxic Vapor Analyzers.  The numerous investigations conducted by Region 5 have yielded significant Hazardous Air Pollutant emission reductions through enforcement actions taken over the past 10 years.  The region is continuing to pursue LDAR enforcement in the energy extraction sector (i.e. natural gas extraction plants), consent decree follow-up inspections for refineries and chemical plants, and Part 63 MACT chemical plants.

MOL- $7.5 Million

Synopsis:
The General Services Administration (GSA) Mid-Atlantic Region intends to solicit proposals for a new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity multiple award term contract for repair and alteration construction services under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

Performance Location: State of Maryland 

General Description of Scope of Services: 
This contract is to provide repair and alteration construction services. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) with a small business size-standard of $36.5 million. 

The individual task orders to be placed under the contract will range in the dollar value from $2,000 to $150,000. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) shall be $7,500,000.00 aggregate for all task orders for the entire term of the contract. The $7,500,000.00 will not be separated equally per awardee. Each contractor on the IDIQ will be able to bid on any task order, regardless of how much work has been completed previously by the contractor on the IDIQ. The minimum guarantee for this contract is $2,500. per contractor for the base year. There is no guaranteed minimum for any option years. 

Offerors will be required to provide a letter from their bonding company with their proposal submission demonstrating their bonding capacity of at least $2,000-150,000 per single project. This contract vehicle will be utilized by the Baltimore Field Office personnel. This contract will be solicited as a one (1) year contract, with four (4) one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Facilities covered under the scope of this contract include Government owned and leased facilities in the State of Maryland.
Services will be required under these contracts on an as-needed basis. Task orders will be prepared on defined scopes of work for specific projects and issued with firm-fixed price tasks orders. The solicitation will include a Statement of Work (SOW) for a seed project within the scope of this contract. The seed project is an actual project that will be used as the basis for price proposal evaluation, and will be awarded as the first task order on the IDIQ contract. 

This procurement is set aside for the 8(a) program. Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. The selected firms will be competitively chosen in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value trade-off process. For this contract technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. A solicitation will be issued requesting offerors to submit in writing both a technical and a price proposal by the offer due date and time. Responsive offers will be evaluated on technical capability and price. The award will be made to the firm that represents the best value to the government. In accordance with FAR 15.404, price analysis will be used to determine price reasonableness and the offerorrâs understanding of the work requirements (i.e. unreasonably low or high prices, as compared to other offers received and the Government Estimate, may indicate the offeror does not comprehend the requirements of the RFP) and the ability to perform the contract.  

The governmentâs intent is to award to (5) five offerors who submit proposals which will provide the best value to the government in terms of technical qualifications and price. The Government intends to make award without discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The complete solicitation package will only be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). It will be available on or about 12/01/2015. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential Offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material. Firms must also be registered with System for Award Management www.sam.gov.
For additional information, visit the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov or the SAM website, www.sam.gov.
Offerors MUST be registered in the Contractor's Central Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement. The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. The website for ORCA is http://orca.bpn.gov.
Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.

All questions must be submitted in writing either by email to the attention of Sam Bohne (Samantha.bohne@gsa.gov (215) 446-2863) or Dan Langan (Daniel.langan@gsa.gov

<DESC><p><strong>SEW016 Lowell Creek Tunnel Repairs, Seward, Alaska<br /></strong>SOLICITATION NUMBER:W911KB-16-R-0008<br /><br /><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY FOR LOWELL CREEK TUNNEL REPAIRS, SEWARD, ALASKA.</strong> The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this acquisition lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources.<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</strong> Perform repairs of worn areas of Lowell Creek Tunnel which is an approximately 2,100 feet long tunnel through Bear Mountain on the southwest side of Seward, Alaska. The tunnel is a 10 feet high, horseshoe shaped tunnel which diverts Lowell Creek away from Seward, through Bear Mountain into Resurrection Bay. The tunnel is lined with concrete throughout. The floor and some of the side wall is armored with a combination of 40 pound and 70 pound railroad rails welded to channel crossties embedded in concrete. Water flow and debris have damaged the tunnel intake transition, tunnel entrance, tunnel sidewall and invert lining. Base contract work will occur within the top 400 feet of the tunnel and will include the following: remove loose concrete between the rails at the intake transition and replace with high strength silica fume concrete; remove loose concrete at exposed rebar at the tunnel entrance walls and roof and replace with high strength silica fume concrete and reestablish missing portions of reinforcement mat of #6 deformed bars; fill a large gouge in the tunnel side wall and adjacent floor and extend steel rail wall armoring by approximately 30 feet; and repair tunnel invert by securing loose rails, removing loose concrete and re-lining the invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Optional work will include re-lining the remainder of the tunnel invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Work will require diversion of Lowell Creek during repairs and will likely occur in the winter (no earlier than Winter 2016/2017) when stream flow is lowest. <br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Heavy and Other Civil Construction, and the related small business size standard is $37.5 Million. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be $1 - $5 Million. <br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR QUALIFIED PRIME CONTRACTOR FIRMS ONLY.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New York District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p>Replacement of the West Point Elementary School, West Point, NY</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The New York District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District) is preparing plans and specifications for the construction of a 95,000 SF, two story elementary school at West Point, NY that will serve approximately 500 children from Pre-K to 4th Grade. The elementary school will be a multi-story building with drilled pier, shallow spread footing, or other appropriate foundation, structural steel frame or other superstructure that supports a clear span reconfigurable facility, reinforced masonry or reinforced concrete and/or metal stud curtain wall with brick or other durable veneer metal, and a combination of curtain wall/punched window glazing systems. Interior construction will consist of some combination of masonry and gypsum wall systems, and operable/movable partition walls. Interior spaces include learning neighborhoods, studios, learning hubs, staff collaboration areas, computing center, art room, music suite, occupational therapy/ physical therapy (OT/PT), a commons area, multi-purpose space, information center, food service, administrative offices, guidance counseling center, a special education office, health services area, maintenance support, central storage area, technology service center, a tie-in to an existing gymnasium (Building 705C), and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. The project includes site improvements such as removing large quantities of rock, heavy grading, signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, covered walkways, exterior lighting, utilities, and playground area. Cafeteria, food service and information center areas were sized for the future elementary school population.<br />The project includes related infrastructure such as gas, water, sewer, electrical, staff and visitor parking areas, student drop off lane, mechanical rooms, emergency access lanes, bus loading/unloading areas, and delivery areas. The project will require demolition of 3 buildings for a total of approximately 63,749 SF.<br />The project involved multiple phases because the existing elementary school must remain operational while the new elementary school is constructed. A temporary parking solution is required while the existing school, parking, and existing bus loop are being demolished to clear footprint for new parking and student drop-off areas that meet AT/FP requirements.<br />Sustainable principles will be maximized in the design, development and construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13123 and other applicable laws and executive orders. Energy conservation and environmentally safe measures will be incorporated in this project wherever feasible, practical or required by regulation. Energy and natural resource conservation measures will be maximized in the design to the extent possible. In accordance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Schools, Silver certification is required.<br />Facilities will be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines/Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy and water conservation standards. The estimated air conditioning load is 300 Tons<br />Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 720 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur between August 2016 and September 2016.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The project will require multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>c. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>d. PLA's have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in this geographic area.</p>
<p>e. A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p><br />1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on similar projects? If so, please provide supporting documentation? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, if available, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area over $25M, within 50 miles of West Point, NY which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? How would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. Are there any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br /><br />6. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>7. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>8. What is the estimated relative cost impact of using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>9. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>10. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Elementary School project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Elementary School project?</p>
<p>11. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>12. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Rippert P. Roberts III, Contract Specialist at Rippert.P.Roberts@usace.army.mil AND NYDCONTRACTING@USACE.ARMY.MIL no later than close of business on 28 December 26 2014.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

Interior spaces include learning neighborhoods, studios, learning hubs, staff collaboration areas, computing center, art room, music suite, occupational therapy/ physical therapy (OT/PT), a commons area, multi-purpose space, information center, food service, administrative offices, guidance counseling center, a special education office, health services area, maintenance support, central storage area, technology service center, a tie-in to an existing gymnasium (Building 705C), and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. The project includes site improvements such as removing large quantities of rock, heavy grading, signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, covered walkways, exterior lighting, utilities, and playground area. Cafeteria, food service and information center areas were sized for the future elementary school population.<br />The project includes related infrastructure such as gas, water, sewer, electrical, staff and visitor parking areas, student drop off lane, mechanical rooms, emergency access lanes, bus loading/unloading areas, and delivery areas. The project will require demolition of 3 buildings for a total of approximately 63,749 SF.<br />The project involved multiple phases because the existing elementary school must remain operational while the new elementary school is constructed. A temporary parking solution is required while the existing school, parking, and existing bus loop are being demolished to clear footprint for new parking and student drop-off areas that meet AT/FP requirements.<br />Sustainable principles will be maximized in the design, development and construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13123 and other applicable laws and executive orders. Energy conservation and environmentally safe measures will be incorporated in this project wherever feasible, practical or required by regulation. Energy and natural resource conservation measures will be maximized in the design to the extent possible. In accordance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Schools, Silver certification is required.<br />Facilities will be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines/Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy and water conservation standards. The estimated air conditioning load is 300 Tons<br />Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 720 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur between August 2016 and September 2016.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The project will require multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>c. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>d. PLA's have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in this geographic area.</p>
<p>e. A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p><br />1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on similar projects? If so, please provide supporting documentation? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, if available, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area over $25M, within 50 miles of West Point, NY which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? How would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. Are there any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br /><br />6. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>7. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>8. What is the estimated relative cost impact of using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>9. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>10. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Elementary School project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Elementary School project?</p>
<p>11. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>12. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>

<DESC><p align="left">&nbsp;The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (RD), High Power Electromagnetic Division (RDH) requires investigation to advance the state-of-the-art / knowledge in high power microwave technologies and scientific knowledge in Directed Energy (DE) technology; specifically, High Power Electromagnetics (HPEM) technology research, development, transformation and transition. <br /><br />This is a continuation of a scientific discovery accomplished under an existing contract that is expiring. Because the technical data was developed exclusively at private expense, the contractor has asserted Limited Rights to that data. In addition, software was also developed exclusively at private expense and the contractor has asserted Restricted Rights to that data. Because the Intellectual Property (IP) belongs to the contractor and it has been determined that the IP is necessary for ongoing research in this area, only the existing contractor can execute this effort. Re-developing the technical data and software, if even possible, would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement. Currently there are no other known commercial vendors that are able to supply the same or similar technical/software data required to meet AFRL/ RDH mission objectives.</p>

FMCSA&rsquo;s Research and Technology (R&amp;T) program is key to reaching the Agency&rsquo;s goal of reducing large-truck-related fatalities.&nbsp; Recognizing that highway crashes often stem from a number of interrelated factors and not just a single cause, FMCSA has created a comprehensive motor carrier R&amp;T program to support its safety goal.&nbsp; <span style="color: #231f20;">The developed R&amp;T program is based on the following strategic objectives: </span></span></p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA251-16-AP-1124	1A. PROJECT/TASK No.  N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$39,515.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System

The Siemens Gamma failed on December 8, 2015. This Gamma camera is used to detect cancerous cells whose images are ready by a physician. A patient is requiring a gamma camera scan before his surgery on the 22nd, and with the holidays, this computer system will not be read in time without emergency funds. The PC needs a complete replacing by Siemens in order for VA Ann Arbor to maintain the hard drives within to keep VA patient health information. It is VA policy to retain all hard drives and thus required to purchase the entire PC.

Siemens Gamma unit - 1 Each

Date required: December 16, 2015. 

Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, 500 GBC Dr., Newark, DE 19702.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Emergency order - If these items are not received immediately, cases will have to be cancelled and patient care will be negatively affected. 

Siemens is the manufacturer of this item and will provide correct parts and service on this unit. Third parties will void the specifications of the system on the 510k approval where Siemens would no longer support the system and VA Ann Arbor would absorb all liability.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

Siemens Gamma camera is manufactured only by Siemens. There are no other alternatives to replacing the imaging workstation with another vendor. Siemens equipment is proprietary and only they are able to service it.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

No market research was conducted due to urgent nature of the procurement and the proprietary hardware and software required for unit to be fully functional.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

<ARCHDATE>03012016
<DESC>The proposed action is to add the Immunogentics and Transplantation lab testing (hereinafter call LIT) to the existing Coagulation and Cancer lab testing contract (VA260-15-P-4894) for its remaining three (3) months (1/01/16 - 3/31/16) while one new contract for lab testing services is being worked on for both services.

The proposed action is a Firm Fixed-Price contract modification to the Coagulation and Cancer Testing contract which expires on 31 March 2016.  Services for this action are currently provided by the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), 3181 Southwest Sam Jackson Park Road Portland, OR 97239. 


Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

Prior to a Veteran receiving a kidney transplant in LIT, the patient must have lab tests to ensure the donor kidney matches the Veteran's tissue and blood types.  One such test is the kidney biopsy test.  A kidney biopsy may be done to check for:

"	Kidney disease when there is blood or protein in the urine or when the kidneys are not working well.
"	Kidney problems seen on an ultrasound or a CT scan.
"	Kidney disease and see if treatment is working.  Why a transplanted kidney isn't working well.

A specimen is taken and sent to a lab.  These tests help reduce the chances that the body will reject a new kidney.  The VAPHCS doesn't have the capability to perform these lab tests.  VAPHCS has partnered with OHSU to have these lab tests performed at the OHSU Reference Laboratory.  The estimated amount is based on previous volumes of testing experienced by OHSU laboratory on behalf of the PVAHCS.
