<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E13PS00004 for Proposed Research Studies on Oil Spill Response Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) Program on Oil Spill Response Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the studies shall be conducted consistently with prior research and studies.  For a summary of research recently performed, visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Oil-Spill-Response-Research-(OSRR).aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BSEE OSRR Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Authors of selected white papers will be requested to submit full proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding via FY 2013 allocations. The BSEE anticipates that $1,200,000 may be available for the initiation of new research and/or studies addressing topics identified through this announcement.  The BSEE does not anticipate any one award exceeding $500,000.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. The BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP). 
OBJECTIVES: 
Responses to the FY 2013 Oil Spill Response Research studies under this announcement should be limited to the following topics: 
1.  Literature Synthesis of Oil Properties Impact on Spill Response Options  Several previous research efforts have been conducted that evaluated specific oil properties impact on various response options.  For example, Environment Canada and SINTEF prepared a report Study of Viscosity and Emulsion Effects on Skimmer Performance during the mid-1990s.  A study is needed to consolidate all of the previous research related to oil properties impact on the various marine oil spill response options such as dispersant use, skimming, and in situ burning.  This study should also clearly point out gaps in knowledge in this area.
2.  Literature Synthesis of Previous Research Conducted on Dispersant Effectiveness  Several previous research efforts have been conducted that evaluated different dispersants effectiveness on various oil types and operating conditions.  A study is needed to consolidate the previous research on dispersant effectiveness and clearly identify knowledge gaps in this area.
3.  Technological Assessment of Alaskan Arctic Oil Spill Response Temporary Oil Storage Options  Oil spill response operations typically involve the temporary storage of recovered oil.  The Arctic operating environment places unique demands on temporary storage options.  A review of the current state of the art of technology available for temporary storage of recovered oil in the Alaskan Arctic is necessary.  This project should also identify any shortcomings and provide recommendations for further research and development efforts in this area. 
4.  Assessment of Oil Spill Response Actions during Periods of Low Light  Prolonged spill responses and Alaskan Arctic winter conditions may benefit from being able to conduct spill response actions during periods of low light.  A study of the impact of periods of low light on oil spill recovery operations and potential remediation options is required.  The study should also provide recommendations for future research or revisions to operational procedures.
5.  Assessment of use of bioremediation products versus chemical dispersants in responding to offshore oil spills - Assess the use of commercial bioremediation products versus chemical dispersants currently listed on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule as response options to mitigate damage to sensitive ecosystems.  Effectiveness, time constraints, potential side effects, and availability should all be considered.  
HOW TO RESPOND: 
White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in Portable Document Format (PDF) format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Sagar S.

<DESC>Question and Answers for Announcement Number 12499 - Request For Information for ISSS Recompetition.
Questions Received from Offerors in Response to the ISSS RFI
1.Our question is in regards to the resumes. In the RFI it states "The Contractor shall provide resumes with their response to this RFI for each employee. Employee resumes will be part of the evaluation process."  The contract that this will replace is not due until late 2013, thus as a small business we cannot guarantee that any resume submitted will still be available as that is a major overhead cost that small business cannot afford.  Talking to the FAA Small Business Office, they agree that the requirement is a bit stringent on Small Business and will stifle competition.  This will give an unfair advantage to the incumbent and will hinder competition.  We ask that the government remove the requirement to submit resumes, unless only used as samples, in order to qualify this as an SDVOSB set-aside.Resumes are not required for the RFI this was an error. 2.I was hoping to confirm who the incumbent is for this requirement?  If you could provide the Contractor and Contract # that would be most helpful.  Thank you for your time!Metters Industries is the incumbent. 3.Is this a new or follow on requirement? If it is a follow on, please let us know the current contract number and contract value? Who is the incumbent? Is it still eligible to bid as a prime for this contract? What is the NAICS Code for this contract?This is a follow-on effort that is being expanded.  See question 2 for incumbent.  The incumbent is eligible to re-bid.  NAICS Code is 541512 4.Is there an incumbent currently providing these services to the FAA?  If so, are they eligible to re-bid?  What is the level of effort in terms of FTEs and dollar amount per year and total? See question 2 and 3 for incumbent.  The number of FTEs and dollar amount are still under development. 5.As we read the qualifications above, it seems that FAA is limiting competition to only those companies that have prior experience supporting US Air Traffic Control Systems with additional preference given to firms that have either FAA or FAA NAS experience.    Our company has experience supporting FAA with IT security services but we do not have experience supporting a United States Air Traffic Control (ATC) System.   Are we interpreting the qualifications correctly in determining our company does not meet the minimum requirements? All companies that demonstrate experience in Information Security Systems will be considered.If SecureIT teams with another company that has ATC experience and together the companies meet all the qualifications, does the team then qualify to be considered for a SIR if all other requirements of the RFI are met? Yes 6.I was emailing you to find out on who the incumbent is currently on the contract ? See question 2. 7.	Who is the current incumbent for this effort? See question 2. 8.	Correspondence related to the ISSS RFI seems to imply that this support is a re-competition.  If so, are you able to share the incumbent company name/contract #?
See question 2.
9.	Can two or more companies team together? If so, should they submit the technical Capabilities statement as one or should they submit them separately?
Only one capabilities statement is acceptable.
10.	In regards to the ISSS RFI, are respondents being asked to include resumes in the RFI response? This requirement is cited in the SOW, but I am unsure if you are seeking comments on the SOW or a response to the SOW. See question 1.  Not accepting comments of the SOW at this time. 11.	The Government has not indicated in section C8.0 of the SOW if a CISSP certification is required for the information security engineer labor category.  Please clarify this requirement. 
The Information Security Engineer must demonstrate proficiency in the information security and be certified in one or more of the items listed in C.1.0. 12.The Government has not indicated in section C8.0 of the SOW if a PMP certification is required for Project/Program manager labor category. Please clarify this requirement. The PMP is not required to be PMP Certified, but also keep in mind resumes will be evaluated.
13.Is there a specific reason why the Government has included CAP and security+ certifications in the selection criteria (section C1.0 SOW), as both certifications provide less professional experience than a CISSP?  The CISSP was the first information security credential accredited under ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024 and, as such, has led industry acceptance of this global standard and its stringent requirements and inspired other information security certification providers to follow suit.
The type of certifications will be evaluated so CISSP may be evaluated higher then CAP.
14.	Could the Government elaborate on why it requires penetration testing and forensic investigator certifications when the tasks outlined in the SOW do not explicitly support need for such certifications? The SOW is a draft and scope being revised.
15.Educational requirements in the Posting (brief abstract) PDF document are more detailed and restrictive than the Government issued SOW.  Could the Government please confirm which document is binding?
See C.8.0.
16.Is this a new effort or is there an incumbent for this effort?  If there is an incumbent, who are they?
See question 2.
17.	If there is an incumbent, approximately how many FTE's do they require to provide the support?
See question 2 for incumbent.  Total FTEs are being expanded and will be available in future notices.
18.	With the NIST's increased emphasis on the Risk Management Framework RMF) and tasking in SOW Tasks C.5.1 d,f,g&i and C.5.2.3 encompassing RMF efforts and expertise the recently ISACA instituted certification for Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) would seem to be a fit for this effort.  According to ISACA, CRISC certification is "designed for IT professionals who have hands-on experience with risk identification, assessment, evaluation, response and monitoring."  Would the FAA consider adding this certification as one of the acceptable certifications for this opportunity?
Yes
19.	Our experience in working with multiple FAA systems has shown that contingency and disaster recover planning is an important part of providing information technology systems security support.  This is validated by the tasking in SOW Tasks C.5.1 i and C.5.2.1 d that specifically require contingency planning expertise.  The Disaster Recovery Institute (DRI) International provides the only known certification process for business continuity professionals - BCP. Would the FAA consider adding this certification as one of the acceptable certifications for this opportunity?
Yes 20.	How many systems are included in the SOW scope for A&A? Scope is still being developed.
21.	Have the systems been through the SA&A process and do they have current authorizations to operate (ATO)? All systems are certified by FISMA and NIST standards annually 22.Is this a new program/contract or is there an incumbent? See question 2
23.	Is there a page restriction on the Capabilities Statement? Please limit your Capabilities Statement to 10 pages.  This notice is for information gathering purposes only.
24.	What is the Government's estimated level of effort by labor category for this requirement? See question 17
25.	On Page 4 of the RFI it states that "The Contractor shall provide resumes with their response to this RFI for each employee.  for each employee, at least one of the following nationally recognized information systems security certifications for performance on this contract."  Please clarify: See question 1 26.	Is a certification required for the Technical Writer/Editor, Document Production Technician and Administrative Support labor categories? No
27.	How many resumes for each labor category are required to be submitted? The number of resumes for each labor category will be up to each Contractor based on the final SOW and other documents included in the final RFP.
28.	Will this be a single award contract or a multi-award contract? The Government reserves the right to make a single award or multiple.
29.	What is the acq Need more information on this.
30.	Our team has a BPA on eFAST, FAA's preferred acquisition vehicle for fulfilling Agency Small Business goals. Will the procurement be through eFAST as companies are already vetted by the FAA with fixed ceiling rates; and the FAA can reduce its procurement costs by issuing task orders under the MOA holder's BPA, as opposed to issuing a new contract? This will not be a eFAST competition.  eFAST labor rates were reviewed and determined to be much higher then the current incumbent Contractor.  eFAST demonstrated only having one company with Information Security experience that was Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business.
31.	Is there an incumbent? See question 2.
32.	How many NAS systems are in scope? Scope is being expanded and can not be determined at this time. \ 33.	Section C.4.4 Internal Audit Reviews: is there any form of evidence that the contractor has to produce to demonstrate compliance? The information will be provided in the final RFP.
34.	 Does each employee have to have one of the listed certifications or does the organization have to have at least one employee with certification? Not all employees have to hold certifications.  See question  26
35.	How many SDVOSB applicants would be considered a sufficient pool of candidates that would not require the FAA to engage the second level RFI for Certified Small Businesses? Three 36.	Will the chosen pool of candidates, who will receive the SIR/RFP, be publically announced? No 37.	It is our understanding that the work described in the SOW is currently being performed by multiple contractors - is the intent to consolidate all the work, on all NAS systems under one contract vehicle or task order? Yes, the FAA does intend to incorporate some expiring contracts into this effort.  To what extent has not been determined.
38.	How many systems will the new contract contain? See question 20
39.	Will a list of the systems be provided? See question 20
40.	Per SOW Section C.1.0 Introduction - the Government requests the following: "The Contractor shall provide resumes with their response to this RFI for each employee. Employee resumes will be part of the evaluation process. Besides having the required education and work experience sited in Section 8.0 of this Statement of Work (SOW), participants must list for each employee, at least one of the following Nationally recognized information systems security certifications for performance of this contract."
There is no request within the separate RFI instructions (separate from the SOW) for resumes to be submitted; the request is only stated in the SOW. Does the Government wish to receive resumes with the responses to the RFI or is this intended only for the future RFP? Given that prospective bidders are in the process of forming teams to respond to this, and may not have staff fully determined at this stage, would it be acceptable to include a general summary of staff and qualifications, in place of resumes? Do not provide resumes, this was an error
41.	Is the requirement for each person assigned to the contract to have at least one of the certifications listed in the SOW? No, see question 26
42.	Please clarify what type of certification the FAA is referring to with the mention of "certified" small business contractors. Must be certified SDVOSB and the appropriate NAICS Code of 541512
43.	eFAST is the FAA's preferred acquisition vehicle for fulfilling agency Small Business goals. We recommend this procurement use eFAST, through which contractors have already been vetted and deemed responsible, experienced, and having pre-negotiated, reasonably-priced fixed ceiling rates. Will the Government consider procuring this contract under eFAST? If not, how does the Government intend to release this procurement? See question 30
44.	Please confirm our understanding that ONLY SDVOSB submissions are due for 'Tier one' by 12-20-2012?  It is our impression that the Government will determine at that time based on the number and quality of the responses received, if the 'Second Tier' for submissions from Small Business only is invoked.  No, all interested companies including Tier 1 and Teir 2 should submit capabilities.
45.	Does the RFI response have any page limitations? No more than ten (10) pages.
46.	How many copies of the RFI response are needed?  Request RFI be sent via email to Stephanie.McKnight-Bailey@FAA.Gov
47.	Will there be another RFI for small businesses if FAA does not get the number of  qualified SDVOSBs (This question is because your RFI document states you will not pursue information and capabilities from Certified Small Business if you get enough SDVOSBs)? No.
48.	Is the FAA ITSSS program going to be separate from the Shared Services Program? Will the Shared Services IT security program and the ITSSS program work together? Yes.  Like in all FAA operations, when required, organization work together to achieve the objectives of the organization.
49.	Who is the incumbent for this project?
See question 2.
50.	Which organization / Line of Business (LOB)  will this ISSS program be reporting into? 
The PMO. 51.	In reference to SOW Section C.1.0, paragraph 11, will resume submission be limited to the prime contractor, or can subcontractor resumes also be submitted? No applicable at this time.  Do not submit resumes. 52.	Can subcontractor experience and qualifications be utilized to satisfy RFI requirements?  If so, will that carry the same weight as the experience and qualifications of the prime? Yes. 53.	Will the scope of this effort be restricted to NAS operational systems or also include administrative systems support? NAS and Administrative System Support. 54.	Are Contractors required to include a resume for every labor category with the response to this RFI.
Do not submit resumes. 55.	The RFI states that submissions should not be emailed or faxed, and a physical address is given for submission, but there is no quantity attached to the submission. We would assume that 1 hard copy submission is required to be delivered to the following address: Submit RFI via email as stated in 46.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division (CCD), Climate Policy Branch (CPB) intends to award a sole source Time and Materials contract to Colorado State University (CSU).   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Efforts to identify other sources to perform the work included a synopsis of the technical requirement as a sources sought notice, posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on 04 April 2012 with a response date for capability statements due on 19 April 2012. Four firms submitted capability statements, and none of the firms were evaluated as being technically capable of fulfilling the requirement.
The EPA determination is that there is only one responsible source capable of satisfying this requirement. The market research to date confirms that there is not another business concern that can replicate the customized inventory methods designed by CSU in order to generate greenhouse gas inventory estimates for agriculture, or a business concern that possesses the familiarity with the complex computer simulation modeling of the Agriculture and Land Use (ALU) Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software tool to estimate and track greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration in developing countries. The work under this award is a continuation and expansion to the current work performed under EPA contract EP-W-08-013 with CSU. There is NO SOLICITATION for this requirement. The contract award will be for a 12 month base year, and four, 12 month option periods for a total of 60 months (5 years).  The total estimated cost for this contract is $3.1 million.   Interested parties can find the St atement of Work on the EPA office of Acquisition Management website, at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/12fs001/index.htm.  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements will be considered.  Written responses must be submitted via email to the sole point of contact, Faye Sas, Contracting Officer at sas.faye@epa.gov no later than 3:00 pm Washington DC local time on Thursday, 27 December 2012.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to obtain potential small business sources that can provide functional and technical capabilities needed in support of the SEC's Data Services Division (DSD) - Messages and Protocol Branch (MPB) - Interoperability Test Tools, Message and Protocol Data Engineering and Transformation. <br>  <br> The Variable Message Format (VMF) Test Tool (VTT) provides test capabilities to validate proper implementation of VMF standards IAW MIL STD 6017:  the Army/Joint Standard used for the Ground Operational Systems and the Joint Systems. The test tool capability provides an integrated software, message database, user interface, and communications protocol functionality.  The test tool implements the application protocol specified in MIL-STD-2045-47001. <br>  <br> The United States Message Text Format (USMTF) Test Tool (MTT) provides test capabilities to validate the proper implementation of USMTF standards IAW MIL- STD 6040:  the Army/Joint Standard used for the Ground Operational Systems and the Joint Systems.  The test tool capability provides integrated software, message database, user interface, USMTF message and protocol data unit (PDU) editing capabilities, automatic message generation capabilities, USMTF and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Message Text Format (XML-MTF) validation capabilities, and communications protocol functionality. Additionally, the test tool implements the application layer protocol specified in MIL-STD-2045-47001. <br>  <br> The Automatic Message Generator (AMG) is a companion tool to the VTT/MTT that automatically generates many VMF and USMTF Messages.  The AMG tool provides a graphical user interface that control message construction.  It has capability to create valid binary VMF/USMTF messages using randomly generated values for MIL-STD-6017x, MIL-STD-6040X and MIL-STD-2045-47001 specifications. <br>  <br> The Combat Net Radio Protocol Test Tool (CNR PTT) provides Army and Joint programs a CAPABILITY for testing compliance to the CNR standards, MIL-STD-188-220 and MIL-STD-2045-47001, thereby facilitating system to system interoperability.  The tool allows programs to test for CNR compliance early in the Systems Development Life Cycle to avoid late defects. <br>  <br> Message and Protocol Data Engineering and Transformation Project coordinates the Army's requirements and changes to Joint and NATO Tactical Messaging and Protocol Military Standards (MIL-STDs); modifying and coordinating these standards as required to reflect new Information Exchange Requirements (IERs), to include urgent changes that if not implemented could result in destruction of equipment or loss of life.  These IERs are often generated by mission changes and technology advancements that bear directly on soldiers operating at the tactical edge.  Current efforts include developing a digital Tactical Combat Casualty Card message for use by Combat Life Savers to document casualty pre-evacuation stabilization efforts, and the development of XML-VMF which will act as an information bridge from the bandwidth-limited forward operating areas back to rear-echelon command and control nodes. Near term efforts include modifying logistics messages to support Condition-Based Maintenance reporting, and incorporation of newly developed message sets for Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).  This effort provides subject matter expertise in key interoperability standards to all Army users that implement tactical messaging operations in Air Defense/Air Command and Control, as well as Land Combat environments, using various messaging formats, to include - Variable Message Format (VMF), United States Message Text Format (USMTF), Combat Network Radio (CNR) protocol, Tactical Data Link (TDL) 16, Link 11, and the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) standards.

<DESC>Synopsis:
This is a Request for Information to determine the availability and potential interest of a contractor or contractors to provide heavy equipment rental to the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation).  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon the responses to this synopsis.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.  The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors. The Provo Area Office Force Account (PAO FA) provides in-house construction services on Reclamation facilities, and on facilities of other federal agencies.  These services vary widely from embankment dam repair work to wetland mitigation construction efforts.  The location of construction also varies, and may be located anywhere in the 17 western states.  The primary zone for construction projects is all of Utah, eastern Colorado, northern Arizona, western Nevada and southern Idaho; however, projects may be completed in any location within the 17 western states.  See Attachment 1 - Statement of Work (SOW). The PAO FA anticipates soliciting for and awarding a Commercial (FAR Part 12), Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for equipment rental services.  Task Orders are anticipated to be issued with Firm Fixed Prices (FFP).  The contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all materials, labor and equipment necessary to deliver, set-up and lease equipment listed in the bid schedule.  Duration of the rental will be addressed in each individually issued Task Order (TO).  The government will pay freight charges for delivery of any single piece of equipment up to 300 miles, where the need is determined fair, reasonable, and necessary to meet the requirements of the TO.

This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes -- It does not constitute a Request For Proposal -- The purpose of this RFI is to engage prospective partners in dialogue leading to research and development (R&D) efforts that enhance utilization of these unique capabilities by industry, universities and other government agencies. The expectation is that NASA MSFC will be reimbursed for all costs incurred through the use of Space Act Agreements (SAA). This first step is to assess interest regarding the unique MSFC Environmental Test capabilities that have the greatest prospects to expand partnerships, customer base and economic opportunities consistent with the NASA mission.  The Government seeks responses from organizations interested in utilizing the unique combination of expertise, labs, tools, and facilities, hereafter referred to as "capabilities" on a reimbursable basis. These capabilities have broad application within diverse industries including the aerospace industry. 1-UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL TEST FACILITY (ETF) A.	MSFC ETF operates a variety of vacuum chambers nominally used to develop and qualify flight hardware for in space environments. Chambers can reach pressures of 10-6 to 10-8 torr. Many are equipped with thermal liners (shrouds)  which use liquid nitrogen to cool the environment to roughly 80 K. Colder temperatures can be obtained locally with liquid helium (about 8 K.) Most chambers can be equipped with heat lamps which can provide temperatures up 600 K. Automatic thermal and vacuum cycling is possible using modernized control and data acquisition systems.	All chambers provide electrical and mechanical pass throughs, and cameras are available for monitoring a test article. The ETF has over a dozen variously equipped smaller chambers.  Larger chambers that are capable of handling test articles weighing several thousand pounds (depending on footprint) include: 	V15  a horizontal axis cylinder 12 ft. diameter, 20 ft. long. 	V20  a horizontal axis cylinder 20 ft. diameter, 28 ft. long. 	Sunspot  a top loading (via 3 ton bridge crane) vertical axis chamber, 10 ft. diameter, 12 ft. long. B.	MSFC ETF has developed the capability of simulating the pressure profile to which a vehicle may be exposed on ascent. The vehicles proposed altitude-time profile is converted to a pressure-time profile using the KSC Range Reference Atmosphere. This profile is then executed in a chamber having a controllable exhaust valve leading to a large vacuum reservoir. Testing to altitudes to 130,000 ft. is currently possible. This facility may also be used for rapid decompression testing within certain limits. C.	MSFC ETF operates several thermal humidity chambers capable of simulating in-cabin environments. Test articles approximately 4 ft. x 4 ft. x 4 ft. may be exposed to temperatures ranging from 200 K to 430 K and relative humidities ranging from 0 to 100% in these chambers. Viewports, cameras, and electrical pass throughs for control and data acquisition can be provided. D.	MSFC ETF maintains a Salt Fog Test Chamber nominally used for simulating the environmental conditions of the KSC on-pad pre-launch environment. Humidity, temperature, airflow and salt content can be varied as needed. 2-UNIQUE FLIGHT ROBOTICS LABORATORY (FRL) A.	Dynamic Overhead Target Simulator (DOTS)  a robotic arm with an 800 lb payload capacity that can move the payload within a 30 x 20 x 160 foot volume.	The Robotic Arm can be moved in pre-canned motions or used in a closed-loop fashion for sensor testing, video testing, proximity operations, docking, and capture testing.  The arm is equipped with a force-torque sensor on the front to measure the forces and torques on the payload. B.	Solar Simulator  a bank of six solar-spectrum equivalent lights, totaling 42 kW. Lights can move the length of the facility and rotate on their carriage to put the light at any angle onto the test article.  Useful for camera testing, lighting tests, and optical sensor testing. C.	Air-bearing vehicles and flat-floor  several air-bearing vehicles of different sizes can be used for realistic motions, capable of carrying payloads of up to 1000 lbs. Small vehicles (such as cubesats) can be tested on the floor with smaller, lighter air-bearings.  Useful for physics-based motion, pointing, proximity operations, sensor, and capture testing. D.	Automated motion/test platforms  two different robotic platforms available to provide relative sensor and target motions of 5 or 6 degrees of freedom utilized for testing/verifying sensor performance and accuracy. E.	Star Field Simulator (arriving by the end of 2012)  monitor, lens, and computer system capable of displaying star fields at 20 Hz update rates.  Useful for testing star tracker sensors. Outside the FRL, but in line with the FRL sensor & camera test capabilities, two other facilities exist that should be included:   E1.	Stray-light Test Facility  100 meter vacuum-capable optical system test chamber and tunnel utilized for testing optics, sensors or cameras in a vacuum environment or for comparing vacuum performance with in-air performance at different ranges.   E2.	300 meter tunnel  300m x 2m x 2m concrete-lined tunnel with a robotic system to translate a target down the length of the tunnel and pitch, yaw, and roll the target. Since the tunnel is controlled access, it is useful for laser testing as well as sensor and camera testing. 3-UNIQUE FLUID FLOW A.	ET20 operates a wind tunnel capable of testing over a range of Mach 0.5 to 5.0. The facility has a 14 x 14 test section 24 long and a newly modernized control and data acquisition system.  Flow visualization is available.  Run times are in excess of 30 seconds at dynamic pressures of 2 to 20 psia. This facility has supported NASA and military vehicle development for over sixty years. B.	A variety of cold flow test facilities that are available. Those using air include the Nozzle Test Facility which can measure thrust up to 1500 lbf and provide flow visualization. Similarly the Turbine Test Facility can be used to evaluate the performance of radially and axially loaded turbines. The Inducer Test Loop and the Pump Test Facility use water to evaluate test article performance. All of these facilities are readily customized to accommodate a variety of test articles and test conditions. 4-UNIQUE X-RAY & CRYOGENIC FACILITY (XRCF) MSFC also maintains and operates the X-ray & Cryogenic Facility (XRCF)  a unique optical, cryogenic, and x-ray vacuum test facility.  The extremely clean, thermally-controlled, vacuum chamber is a horizontal cylinder 20 feet in diameter and 65 feet long capable of achieving temperatures from 20 Kelvin to 160F and vacuum levels less than 10-6 Torr.  The chamber is connected to a 5 ft diameter x 1700 ft long horizontal, evacuated tunnel (illumination beam-line).	As the worlds largest x-ray optical test facility, the XRCF enables development, performance, and calibration testing of grazing-incidence x-ray optics, detectors and telescopes.  The XRCFs cryogenic optical test capabilities enable the development and pre-flight evaluation of large direct-incidence telescope mirrors and structures in relevant environments. THE PROCESS The Government and partner will jointly define potential R&D efforts; develop mutually agreed to statements of work, cost, and schedule as defined in a reimbursable Space Act Agreement (SAA). The Government anticipates some respondents may be interested in only one area or sub-area while others may be interested in broad efforts requiring more than one capability. Some organizations may want to partner because of direct needs, or there may be respondents who desire to utilize specific support to meet needs of third parties. Such activities can be accommodated utilizing a SAA, either for a single project or for a group of projects (umbrella SAA), consistent with the NASA mission. Based on the quantity and quality of responses, NASA MSFC ETF expects to engage selected organization(s) in further discussions regarding expanded partnerships, customer base and economic opportunities consistent with the NASA mission. Site visits are welcomed and the ETF encourages face-to-face meetings to foster additional dialog pertaining to any proposed partnerships.

<DESC><strong>General Information</strong>:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><strong><br />Background:</strong><br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP) was established within the Department of Health and Human Services and charged with coordinating toxicological testing programs within the Public Health Service of the Department. The NTP, as part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), is responsible for evaluating the toxic and carcinogenic potential of environmental agents that may pose a health hazard to citizens of the United States. The NTP requires support for the conduct of short- and long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies following exposure to a variety of test agents by various routes of exposure. This requirement is designed to study diverse agents that may include: environmental chemicals; chemicals used in manufacturing or industrial settings; naturally occurring chemicals; food additives, preservatives, colorants or flavorings; pharmaceuticals, botanically- and non botanically-based dietary supplements; herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides; ingredients found in a wide variety of consumer products including soaps, lotions, perfumes and cosmetics; chemicals used in detergents and cleaners, etc.; naturally occurring and synthetic fibers, nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes; metals; plasticizers; flame retardants; mold or mold components; or other agents not specified at this time.<br /><strong><br />Purpose:</strong><br />NIEHS is seeking capability statements from interested and qualified small businesses to conduct toxicology and carcinogenicity studies for the NTP. These studies will support and assist the NTP research effort to evaluate toxicity and carcinogenicity of test agents studied.<br /><strong><br />Project Details:</strong><br />Ongoing and recurring evaluations shall be conducted to evaluate the toxicity and carcinogenicity of test agents by various routes of exposure. For each test agent a detailed protocol outline will be provided by the Government to the testing laboratory. The design of studies assigned to the contract will vary as needed depending on the individual test agents, route(s) of exposure, and endpoints to be evaluated. Studies will typically utilize Harlan Sprague Dawley rats and B6C3F1/N mice; however, other stocks/strains or other species may be utilized. Study duration may be from a few days up to 2-years or lifetime; exposure may begin in utero or in young animals; the route of administration may be inhalation (whole body or nose only), oral (dosed feed, dosed water, gavage), dermal or parenteral (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intratracheal). Endpoints to be evaluated may include signs of toxicity in life (survival, body weight, food/water consumption, clinical observations), clinical pathology (hematology and clinical chemistry), organ weights, gross and histopathology, and determination of concentration of the test article blood, tissues and excreta). Test agents will typically be provided to the contractor. For inhalation studies, the contractor shall develop methods for characterizing identity and purity to be conducted prior to the start and during the course of the studies. In addition, methods for exposure generation and monitoring of chamber concentrations shall be developed and validated by the contractor. For routes other than inhalation, chemical reanalysis (identity and purity) and dose formulation and analysis methods will typically be provided to the contractor, and test agents will typically have been evaluated for identity and purity (for routes other than inhalation) prior to shipment to the contractor. The contractor will be required to demonstrate method performance prior to starting the studies. Details for typical study designs and for individual routes of administration are found in the Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the National Toxicology Program dated January 2011 and any subsequent revisions (<a href="http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/Test_Info/FinalNTP_ToxCarSpecsJan2011.pdf">http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/Test_Info/FinalNTP_ToxCarSpecsJan2011.pdf</a>).<br /><br />Award of a cost-reimbursement, level of effort type contract is contemplated. The total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be between 50,000 to 100,000 labor hours per year, including options, depending on the needs of the NTP. The laboratory would be anticipated to provide support to the NTP toxicity and carcinogenicity testing effort by conducting approximately 2-4 prechronic toxicity studies and 2-4 chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies per year.

<SUBJECT>20--MEDIUM-VOLTAGE, ALTERNATING CURRENT VACUUM CIRCUIT BREAKERS (VCB) FOR NAVY SURFACE SHIPS
<SOLNBR>N0002413R4206
<RESPDATE>010413
<ARCHDATE>01312013
<CONTACT>Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil
202-781-2629
<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office) seeking information on medium voltage, alternating current vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs) for use on Navy surface ships. PMS 320 seeks to determine the industry capability, estimated costs, and development steps required to test and qualify first articles of these breakers in a timeframe necessary to support specification development for future ship acquisition programs.

The Navy currently uses Air Circuit Breakers (ACB) for medium voltage circuit protection in several shipboard applications, which is specified by MIL-DTL-17587/4.  Presently, there is little commercial demand for medium voltage ACBs and a small vendor base that supply mil-qualified ACBs to the Navy, because most of the industrial circuit protection industry employs VCB technology.
  To reduce system costs, the Navy seeks to leverage advancements made by industry in VCB technology and to understand the costs and schedule associated with developing and qualifying a VCB for future surface ships as a potential cost savings alternative to the existing, qualified ACB solution.  It is anticipated that the total number of VCBs needed in the near future may be in excess of 400 breakers. 

VCB based switchboard solutions meeting the following high level requirements are sought:
Nominal Operating Voltage: 4160 volts AC, 3 phase.  
Amperage: 1200 amps minimum, 2000 amps objective.
Width: 23 inch cabinet.
Depth: 55.5 inch (without drip shield) and 62 inch (with drip shield).
Height: 	80 inch (without foundation).
Hard mounted.
Minimum Interrupt rating: 40kA symmetrical and 68kA asymmetrical.
 
Switchboard designs must accommodate vertical stacking of two VCBs within a single 23inch wide cabinet.
  Additional switchboard control hardware (such as protection relays) must be accommodated within a single VCB cubical space.  As an example, a notional switchboard consisting of three breakers and associated controls and protection equipment must fit within 2 vertical sections, for a total length of 46 inches.

Compliance to Standards:  
Notional Detail Specification for VCBs, Notional Detail Specification for Switchboards, and Notional Performance Specification for Relays have been developed that support this effort.  All three documents are intended to be complementary.  Expected compliances that the VCB system would have to adhere to are contained in these notional documents.  Actual requirements are still under development by the Navy.
  These documents are marked DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractors only; Critical Technology). A technical data package with the three notional specification/performance requirements can be provided upon request and upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide US Department of Defense (DoD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data package that may include limited distribution information.  Evidence in the form of an executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to receipt of the technical data package.  Please request the technical data package via email to the following address: joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil.
  References in the technical data package to a Qualified Products List (QPL) are notional at this time.

Responses:
PMS 320 is seeking industrys feedback and commentary on the scope, schedule and rough order of magnitude costs associated with qualifying a VCB by February 1, 2014 (in time for supplying a qualified VCB switchboard by February 1, 2017).

The Navy is also interested in responses to the following questions regarding VCB development and qualification:

1. Identify any issues or exceptions you may have with qualifying a VCB to the standards and requirements contained in the technical data package.
2. Identify any other objections, concerns or barriers that would prevent you from developing a qualified VCB in the aforementioned ratings, per the requirements contained in the technical data package.
3.
 Provide a rough order of magnitude cost for development (non-recurring engineering) of a VCB per the requirements contained in the technical data package.
4. Provide a rough order of magnitude cost to perform qualification testing on a VCB per the requirements contained in the technical data package.
5. What is your estimated timeline to complete qualification testing, including the steps required?  (Objective is to have by qualified VCBs by February 1, 2014.)
6. Identify independent investments or efforts you may be taking to develop equivalent VCBs for Navy applications.  
7. Comment on your ability to support the proposed breaker over a ships 40 year service life.
8. How is the device you may propose for qualification different than commercial devices you may be producing today for industry or military applications?
9.
 If you intend to use a commercial device and qualify it to the referenced standards, can you elaborate on your qualification plans?  Specifically, the Navy is interested in understanding qualification approaches and schedules that seek to address and retire Navy specific risks early on in the qualification process.  
10. Do you intend to use a derated, commercial breaker with ruggedized packaging or do you have a different approach?
11. The draft specifications indicated several optional requirements.  The Navy is interested in which of those requirements can be met within the space constraints requested in this RFI.

12. Which required specification could be eliminated by substituting a suitable commercial alternative?  What should be considered as a suitable alternative to each of the ones you identified? Please identify the requirements that inhibit the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products or existing Non-Developmental Item (NDI) components.

Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on January 4, 2013.
  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.  Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files.  All inquiries and comment submissions should be emailed to joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information.  However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
  

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.
  No written responses will be returned.

<DESC>Request for Information M00264-13-RFI-0204<br />Genealogy Research Support Services
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain support services to provide assistance to Headquarters Marine Corps Deputy Commandant, Manpower &amp; Reserve Affairs (DC,M&amp;RA), Casualty Section (MFPC) in the area of genealogy research supporting POW/MIA Affairs. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The M&amp;RA Casualty Section is responsible for identifying maternal relatives of Marines unaccounted for from past wars to donate a Family Reference Sample (FRS) for DNA testing. The Contractor is required to provide the labor, supplies, materials, and facilities to assist the Casualty Section in locating family members of over 3,000 Marines previously unaccounted for from World War II, approximately 30 Marines unaccounted for from the Vietnam War and the Korean War, and to locate family members of Marines previously recovered and identified from the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Cold War, when additional remains are recovered and identified. Previous support was provided under contract number M00264-10-D-0005.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED: The draft Performance Work Statement provided with this RFI sets forth the work efforts required to support genealogy research. Cases are individually assigned and worked. The scope of this effort shall encompass the following objectives/tasks:</p>
<p>- The contractor will first attempt to find the Marine's Next of Kin (NOK), as defined by DODI 1300.18.<br />- The contractor will report all potential NOK found as a result of the genealogy search. The contractor will report the NOK's contact information to MFPC. MFPC will contact the family and if it is confirmed they are maternally related, the file may be closed.<br />- The contractor will respond with the NOK's contact information as required within 72 hours of receipt of the request from MFPC. Information attained from the contractor must result in a successful contact with a NOK 90% of the time. <br />- Should the NOK not be maternally related to the Marine, the contractor will report NOK contact information to MFPC and proceed to TASK 4(2).<br />- Should an attempt to find the Marine's NOK be unsuccessful, the contractor should inform MFPC and proceed to TASK 4(2).<br />- When either the Marine's NOK is not maternally related or the NOK could not be located, the contractor should attempt to find two living paternal relatives of the Marine.<br />- Should two living paternal relatives of the Marine be found, the contractor should report all information to the MFPC. <br />- When it is determined that only one or no paternal relatives will be located, the contractor will report all available information to MFPC. <br />- The contractor will utilize MFPC's standardized spreadsheet to report progress/successful contacts on a weekly basis. Reports will be submitted on time and be error free 90% of the time.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (5) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives; (2) Two customer references describing similar work efforts; (3) Commercial published labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services ( if available- this does not count against the 5 page limit); and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size, CAGE Code and GSA Schedule contract number if available.</p>
<p>Response is due by 3 January 2013, 3:00 PM. Please submit e-mail responses to Lawrence Rice, Customer Liaison, at: Lawrence.rice@usmc.mil</p>
<p>NOTES: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation. The Marine Corps is neither seeking proposals nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: RED BOOKTM ADVANCED DRUG PRICING DATABASE
<p>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) 441 G. Street NW, Washington DC in accordance with FAR Part 13; intends to negotiate a Purchase Order on a sole source basic with Truven Health Analytics for RED BOOKTM Advanced Drug Pricing Database</p>
<p>This notice is considered to be sole source to Truven Health Analytics; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. This is not a request for proposals. GAO believes that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing these services to satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>The RED BOOK<sup>TM</sup> Advanced drug pricing database provides pricing and descriptive information for prescription and over-the-counter drugs. It provides detailed information about health-care products, including prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, chemicals used for compounding, medical devices, and medical supplies. Specifically, it includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Every drug product approved by the FDA for manufacture and distribution. <br />&bull; For each product record, brand name, generic name, NDC number, dosage, form, strength, route of administration, and package size. <br />&bull; Available fields indicate single-source, DESI and repackaged products; controlled substances; <br />&bull; Maintenance drugs; "Orange Book" codes, which are the FDA's therapeutic equivalence ratings for multi-source products; and CMS J-Codes for establishing and/or validating reimbursement schedules for injectable drugs. <br />&bull; Updated with new product and/or pricing information. <br />&bull; NDC numbers maintained in "5-4-2" and "Standard 10" formats; if a number changes, the database supplies both the new and old NDC.<br />&bull; Unique numbering systems to assist in the identification and comparison of products with common generic ingredients, formulations, and therapeutic classifications.</p>
<p>The specific data elements contained in the RED BOOK database are necessary to meet the requirements of two Health Care team engagements. The first, engagement 291064 (Shortages of Controlled Substances), is follow-up work to engagement 290956, which resulted in GAO-12-116 (Drug Shortages: FDA's Ability to Respond Should be Strengthened) in November 2011. The second engagement is being staffed now, and is also a follow-up to the November 2011 Drug Shortages product. These engagements require longitudinal analyses of drug characteristic and pricing data. To develop a methodologically rigorous study for a longitudinal analysis, consistent data must be used. GAO currently has RED BOOKTM Advanced Drug Pricing Database data for years 2007 through June 2012. The acquisition of a new drug pricing database would require not only the purchase of the current data, but also the additional cost associated with purchasing multiple prior years of data. In addition, FAIS has three current engagements that are expected to require RED BOOK data (192403, 192406, and 192417), and both FAIS and Health Care anticipate continued demand for work in this area.</p>
<p>This Purchase Order will be effective from the date of award with a base and four one year option periods. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to Contract Specialist, Lourie Blount (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 441 G. Street, NW, Room 7116-5, Washington, DC, 20548). Responses for this notice must be received within 15 days after electronic posting as a notice in the FEDBIZOPPS. For inquiries regarding this notice, please contact Lourie Blount at (202) 512-3714 or BlountL@gao.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library (NAL) intends to award a contract to the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) and Soil Science Society of America (SSSA), in Fitchburg, WI, to provide electronic access via the internet for all USDA users for selected ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals. The three societies share a journal publication program. NAL requires electronic access via the internet to ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users, cooperators, and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA. Access should include perpetual data rights to the content that is made available to USDA during the performance period. The contractor shall provide, upon termination of the contract and upon a request from USDA, all subscribed-to purchased content in a mutually agreed-upon non-proprietary format. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. There is no source but the ASA-CSSA-SSSA for the electronic content of the subscribed publications. ASA-CSSA-SSSA does not offer the perpetual rights to any other company for resale, nor does the ASA-CSSA-SSSA sell the full content of its electronic publications to others for resale. The ASA-CSSA-SSSA offers its electronic publications from their website via IP recognition, or in a deliverable electronic format and medium that may be loaded elsewhere. Resellers of ASA-CSSA-SSSA publications are available, but none offers the perpetual rights to the publications. Only the ASA-CSSA-SSSA is capable of supplying the previously subscribed content in an electronic format and medium that would be suitable for loading on NAL's servers, and only the ASA-CSSA-SSSA can supply new content in that electronic format and medium as it is published.</p>
<p>Anticipated Date of Award: 12/26/2012<br /></p>

<DESC>F-16 Weapon System<br />Solicitation Number: FA8252-13-R-00188AAAA<br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Force Materiel Command<br />Location: Hill AFB OO-ALC
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force is planning an acquisition strategy for the follow-on production of the F-16 Wiring Harnesses, NSN 5995015742616/Part Number 5136L030-3. The F-16 Wiring Harness requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source requires acquisition of the part from the approved source. The approved source retains data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued production of highly specialized components.</p>
<p>The F-16 Wiring Harness connects the aircraft systems to the feedback potentiometer on the steering actuator. All of the signals and information measured by the feedback potentiometer is transmitted across this wiring harness and read by the aircraft computers. The harness is critical in ensuring that the data is reliably transmitted to the aircraft. Also, it is critical that the wiring harness is made to the correct dimensions so it does not rub or chafe against any other item on the aircraft.</p>
<p>The estimated award date is 11 MAR 2013 with performance expected up to 30 JUN 2014. First delivery of fully qualified production units is to begin within 15 months of award. The current estimate for delivery quantities is as follows: 28 JUN 2013 - 167 units, 30 SEP 2013 - 87 units, 31 DEC 2013 - 31 units, 31 MAR 2014 - 53, and 30 JUN 2014 - 11 units. This delivery schedule must be met or exceeded.</p>
<p>Note: The F-16 Wiring Harness and associated interface data is contractor proprietary and therefore not available. Any required qualification or integration testing costs, such as a First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) program, would be applied to the production price. The contractor must provide adequate production, test and logistics (warranty) support to ensure and maintain operational readiness and suitability of the F-16 weapon system for a minimum of 20 years.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government's intention to pay for information solicited at this time. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Christine Fukuda/ AFSC OL:H/PZAAB, (801) 777-6466. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman is Mr. Kevin Flinders/PKC, (801) 777-4392.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis. Information submitted should be addressed to AFSC OL:H/PZAAB (JDAM), Attn: Ms. Christine Fukuda, 6050 Gum Lane Bldg 1215, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide DOL, Office of Job Corps (OJC) with products and services to deliver one prime contractor to be responsible for providing background checks for approximately 200,000 Job Corps applicants annually.
<p><br />A. Background</p>
<p>A1. Background Information on the Job Corps Program<br />Job Cops is an open-entry/open-exit, career skills, academic, and life skills education and career technical training program for low-income youth, ages 16 through 24.<br />With 125 centers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Job Corps is primarily residential with a small non-residential component. The program was established in 1964 and is presently authorized under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Job Corps. In addition to a National Office, there are six Job Corps Regional Offices located nationwide.<br />Enrollees in the program must meet basic eligibility requirements. They must be low-income youth, ages 16 through 24. They also could meet one or more of the following categories:<br />&bull; A high school dropout<br />&bull; Homeless<br />&bull; A runaway or a foster child<br />&bull; Parents or individuals who require additional educational, career skills training, counseling and related assistance in order to participate successfully in regular schoolwork or to secure and hold employment</p>
<p>The typical youth served by Job Corps is an 18-year-old high school dropout who reads at the elementary school level, comes from an economically disadvantaged family and has been unemployed for many weeks, is underemployed, or has never had a job. The program provides educational, career skill, and life skills training, housing in dormitories, work experience, counseling, basic health care and other support services. Students receive a small allowance while enrolled to pay for personal needs, and they may be eligible for a transition payment if they complete career skills training and/or earn their High School Diploma or GED. Students also receive a clothing allowance.<br />The mission of the program is to attract eligible young adults, teach them the skills they need to become employable and independent, and provide the necessary transition assistance to attach them for the long-term to the labor market in meaningful jobs, further education, or military service. Ultimately, the training should enable the students to become self-sufficient members of society who contribute to the community as taxpayers and good citizens.<br />B. Goals/Objectives</p>
<p>B1. Goal: Job Corps is the nation's largest career technical training and education program for low-income students ages 16 through 24. One of the eligibility criteria is that the applicant does not have any court involvement and is not currently under agency supervision. Job Corp's Program and Requirements Handbook (PRH) mandates that each Admission Counselor (AC) must obtain the addresses where the applicant has lived in the last 3 years and any residential history arrest records during that time. The AC must obtain sufficient information from the applicable courts, institutions, and agencies in those jurisdictions, so as to determine whether the applicant has any current court or agency involvement. Currently, multiple sources are used to gather this data; OJC is looking for a single vendor to conduct the background checks for all applicants nationwide.</p>
<p>The background check contractor will support and assist Job Corps Outreach and Admissions staff in verifying that potential applicants are eligible for the program under the court involvement and/or agency supervision criterion.<br />C. Conduct Background Checks<br />The contractor shall conduct criminal background checks for individuals that are applying to the Job Corps program. The Outreach and Admissions (OA) office will provide the name, Social Security Number, and the addresses where the applicant has lived in the last 3 years. The background check is screening for any residential history arrest records or current court involvement.</p>
<p>C1. Report Data<br />The background check report for each applicant must contain sufficient information from the applicable courts, institutions, and agencies in those jurisdictions, so as to determine whether the applicant has any current court or agency involvement. The report should be provided within 5 business days of receipt of request for data from the OA office.<br />All contractors responding to this announcement must demonstrate their experience in the aforementioned work. Pertinent factors for consideration of qualifications are the primary contractor's demonstrated experience with the following: <br /><br />1. Experience from the past three years that is relevant in content, scope, and complexity to the requirements needed to provide national background checks.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall identify the use of efficient and effective methods and strategies when conducting applicant background checks.</p>
<p>Only vendors qualified to provide these services are invited to respond.</p>
<p><br />PROCEDURE FOR SUBMITTING RESPONSES</p>
<p>Each organization should submit only one response.

For those labs that would like to test the effectiveness of their SEDD electronic reporting capabilities, EPA is making available its test version of the Electronic Data Exchange and Evaluation System (EXES) that is being developed to support the CASC program.  Any laboratory that anticipates responding to the CASC solicitation is encouraged to utilize this tool prior to publication of the CASC solicitation currently scheduled for March 2013.  EPA foresees requiring both hard copy data package and SEDD electronic data as part of the CASC solicitation process.  Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) developers, and others who support laboratory SEDD electronic reporting capabilities, are also welcome to utilize this test environment.
Should you wish to take advantage of this opportunity to test SEDD files for the CASC procurement, please submit an email request to Michael S. Johnson, johnson.michaels@epa.gov and Ross Miller, miller.ross@epa.gov , with the following information:
1)	Full Name 2)	Company Name 3)	Address 4)	Phone Number 5)	Email Address 6)	Business Type (laboratory, software   developer, etc.)

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Suture. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is November 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil 210-292-3270 and Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Suture. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $8,585,350.40. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 15 consolidated line items (1828 sub-clustered line items) of the total 1864 line items account for 90.82% ($7,797,802.73) of the total volume in sales $8,585,350.40 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide <strong>an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil 210-292-3270 and Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. </strong>The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The seven requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /><br /></strong>1.

<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Vendor will be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. Vendor will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to make demonstration/in-service arrangements/appointments with the participating MTFs so that the instructions are available for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Vendor must provide in-servicing within the following 14 calendar days to be completed within a total of 28 days of notification. Arrangements must be made for product samples to be delivered to participating MTFs by the scheduled in-service date. Vendor who does not make the before mentioned arrangements by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative. Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the dates of the in-services for the participating MTFs. The vendor must coordinate all in-services so that all MTFs are in-serviced before the evaluation starts. Vendor will be allowed to be present during the in-servicing. Vendor will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitor's products. Vendor will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or price related factors. A vendor who speaks and/or attempts to speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluations, pricing or price related factors will be disqualified from this evaluation process.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately seven MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.<br /><br />1. Efficiency of Care/Infection Control - (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence based practices for preventing surgical site infections; FDA 21 Code of Federal Regulation 878.4493). The suture secures the edges of a wound without tissue trauma or leakage. Clinicians understand that maintaining skin integrity during and after suturing is important to prevent the adverse effects on skin barrier function. <br />2. Efficiency of Care/Infection Control - (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence based practices for preventing surgical site infections). Reliable and easy to knot--smooth tissue passage (glide) without tissue tear. Clinicians understand that maintaining skin integrity during and after suturing is important to prevent the adverse effects on skin barrier function, and that tying suture knot is of paramount importance. <br />3. Efficiency of Care/Infection Control - (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence based practices for preventing surgical site infections; Additionally, complies with the FDA Quality System Regulation, CE Specifications, and ISO 13485; 21 CFR 820.120 governing labeling). The suture packaging allows for easy and safe identification of suture size, needle size and suture type. Clinicians understand the need to readily and quickly identify products by package labeling.<br />4. Efficiency of Care/Infection Control - (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence based practices for preventing surgical site infections). The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. The principals of infection control are of significant importance to the clinician and the package must be designed in a way that allows the clinician to open it and remove the product from the packaging and deliver it to a sterile field without risk of contamination of the product or the sterile field.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes</strong>. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<p><br />MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>

Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

(End of clause)<br />1352.209-74: Organizational conflict of interest (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>____________________________</p>
<p>1. General Principles:</p>
<p>The incumbent is the primary point of contact and coordinator of U.S. Government (USG) activities, schedules and events related to the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the country. The PEPFAR Coordinator plays a key role in the planning, inter-agency implementation, and inter-agency reporting on program performance. The role of the Coordinator is becoming more essential as the size and complexity of the PEPFAR/Ukraine program grows from a few projects to 23 discreet activities.</p>
<p>The Ambassador leads the in-country PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker under PEPFAR Guidance to all program plans and activities submitted to the US Deputy Principal's Group, with final authority to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator for approval. The first line supervisor for this position is the Ambassador or his designee. The PEPFAR Coordinator is an internal USG facilitator, a communicator, and ensures the timely roll-out of PEPFAR reports and implementation plans. The PEPFAR Coordinator is responsible for maintaining an electronic interagency tracking report. The Coordinator is not a technical director and is not expected to provide technical oversight of programs, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Country Operational Plan (COP) and other performance review information.</p>
<p>The PEPFAR/Ukraine Country team currently has an interagency working group comprising agency leads. The Coordinator is accountable to ensure this group meets regularly, has an agenda, and is achieving objectives. As required or needed, the management working group may consist of smaller interagency technical working groups (TWGs) around themes such as medication assisted therapy, prevention or disease surveillance. In general, the PEPFAR Coordinator, in collaboration with Agency leads, will be accountable to ensure that these groups are established, have an agenda, are achieving objectives and maintain a clear file on actions taken, results and key issues.</p>
<p>Agency leads should be copied on communications between the Coordinator and TWGs or staff as well as on substantive communications between the Coordinator and the Country Support Team Lead in headquarters. This procedure is essential to retain trust and respect between agency leads and the Coordinator. In addition, it is critical that the Coordinator be copied on internal agency communication related to matters of PEPFAR program strategy, implementation, and management and staffing.</p>
<p>The Coordinator will periodically meet with the host country and technical partners, particularly when the nature of these contacts and meetings is related to bilateral coordination and information sharing. When the Coordinator meets with host country government counterparts, s/he should include Agency leads or, if not possible, consult with Agency leads. Regarding meetings that are of a technical nature or for purposes of negotiating with partners, this function will be maintained by the Agency leads.</p>
<p>The Coordinator is the USG lead for coordinating and assembling the country operations plan (COP), Semi-Annual Performance Review (SAPR), and Annual Performance Review (APR) development. The Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that reports are submitted to Washington on time, for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work, and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.</p>
<p>2. The Ukraine Context and Background:</p>
<p>The PEPFAR/Ukraine portfolio is a $22.0 million annual program currently supporting HIV/AIDS prevention, including medication assisted therapy (MAT), safe blood supply, disease surveillance and HIV/TB integration and referrals, support for pharmaceutical management and commodity supply chain management for HIV, TB and other co-infection drugs and medication for MAT. The PEPFAR/Ukraine programs works with both the public sector and leading HIV non-governmental organizations (NGOs) across the country and a select number of private sector groups in leveraged partnerships. The program also engages a number of partners in academic institutions, foundations, international and bilateral organizations as well as the multilateral funding mechanism, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), which is the largest external HIV/AIDS donor. The USG is the largest bilateral donor providing funds, technical assistance and some commodity support for HIV/AIDS programs.<br /><br />USG HIV/AIDS activities in Ukraine fall under the responsibility of the PEPFAR/Ukraine Team, under the leadership of the Ambassador, with principle membership being the US Agency for International Development (USAID/Ukraine), the US Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office (HHS/CDC/Ukraine), the US Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMSHA) the US Peace Corps, which currently has over 500 volunteers making it the largest PC program in the world, and the Office of the Defense Attach&eacute; (DOA). Issues addressed by the Team include PEPFAR program implementation (program planning, budgeting, oversight, and reporting), support and assistance to Global Fund activities and coordinating with other health sector donors on issues regarding HIV/AIDS. In FY 2010, PEPFAR/Ukraine managed a $12 million program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Tunis, Tunisia as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Tunisia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2011, long-time President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled Tunisia after one month of youth-led protests fueled by socioeconomic grievances, corruption, and political repression.  The revolution ushered in a wave of political excitement for Tunisia and prompted the initial steps towards democracy and political reform.  USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) seeks to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society and more equitable, responsive, and legitimate governance.  In particular, the program provides material and technical support to communities, civil society organizations, and local institutions to help build democratic resiliency, increase citizen participation in democratic life, and bolster positive change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Country Representative to provide oversight and management of OTI's country program in Tunisia.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p><br />MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>RFP 225198 <br />One X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (XSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered XSAPRs and the new XSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as XSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the XSAPR-2 and the associated infrastructure to install XSAPR-2 at the ARM site on Graciosa Island in the Azores.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed in the Azores, Portugal.</p>

<DESC>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330. <br>  <br> The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified commercial sources technically capable of providing the below: <br> 	 <br> The Signal Center of Excellence (SIGCoE), Capability Development Integration Directorate's (CDID), Experimentation Division (ED), Fort Gordon, GA is tasked to support the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Capabilities and Integration Center (ARCIC) in both Concepts (FY20) Branch and Live Experimentation (FY13) Branch.   <br>  <br> Concepts Experimentation includes participation in the TRADOC approved Experimentation Campaign which integrates Army 2020 initiatives during Joint Warfighter exercises.  The Experimentation Campaign will leverage a 3-star Mission Command Training Program (MCTP) exercise to validate Army 2020 concepts and future force designs.  The intent of experimentation of future concepts is to identify future Army requirements and to perform capability assessments across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leader Development and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains thru supporting a series of simulated exercises and wargames played in the Battle Lab Collaborative Simulation Environment.   The contractor must understand and provide through detailed and in-depth analysis of areas such as the ability for the Signal 2020 force structure to support a full war and/or excursion; the ability of a Signal Corps G-6 section to function as a J-6; or analysis of capability gap specifications for the aerial tier.   The contractor must understand and be able to utilize the TRADOC distributed simulation environment to conduct required analysis, communications effects models, development of Learning Demands and Objectives, and the MCTP to plan and design experiments, collect data, conduct analysis, and provide final reports. <br>  <br> Live Experimentation is intended to mitigate risks to investment in materiel and non-materiel solutions by conducting analysis and experimentation on prototype solutions in an attempt to place capabilities in the hands of soldiers as soon as possible.  The primary focus is on the soldier and small unit functions examined during the Army Expeditionary Warfighting Experiments (AEWE).   During annual AEWE experiments the ED provides technical integration of prototype equipment and networks to support concept assessments, analysis of requirements and materiel development issues.   Live Experimentation provides the analytic rigor and learning to inform concepts and to accelerate capabilities development across all warfighting functions.  The contractor must provide hands-on systems engineering network and data expertise to conduct actual hardware and software integration into experimentation venues.  The contractor will provide network planning, design, setup, integration, configuration, spectrum management, information assurance, execution, data collection, technical procedure manual development and formal written analysis.  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates the tasks and deliverables defined within this sources sought will require ten and a half (10.5) personnel.  The personnel shall be broken down to include (1) Program Manager/Technical Lead/ Principal Engineer - ONSITE; (3) Operations Research Systems Analysts; (3.5) Network Engineers; (2) Engineers (1- Radio Frequency (RF) Engineer and 1 - Satellite Engineer); and (1) Computer Software Application Engineer. <br>  <br> Period of Performance shall consist of a 12 month base year plus 2 option years beginning 1 June 2013. <br>  <br> Potential offerors having the skills, experience, professional qualifications, certifications, clearances and capabilities necessary to perform the described requirement are invited to provide a capabilities statement via e-mail.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command, Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201), intends to competitively award a single firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to either ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS INC. (ATK) (CAGE Code: 70272) or KDI PRECISION PRODUCTS, INC/L-3 COM (L-3) (CAGE Code: 66126), for the acquisition of the FMU-139C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze, (NSNs: 1325-01-535-6160, 1325-01-535-6164, 1325-01-517-2822 and/or 1325-01-517-2828) for the United States Navy (USN) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The objective of this effort is to contract with either of the two currently approved and qualified sources to produce and deliver a limited quantity of FMU-139C/B fuzes. This competition is restricted to existing qualified sources and this award will not be delayed to qualify additional sources. Both of the above listed firms are currently under contract to produce and deliver FMU-139C/B fuzes in accordance with FMU-139C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003. In addition, both firms were found, via a previous limited competition effort, to have technically acceptable proposals for the production of FMU-139C/B fuzes produced in accordance with Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003A. L-3 is currently under contract, and in production to deliver, FMU-139C/B fuzes in accordance with Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003A. The production units intended to be procured under this effort shall meet the requirements of the Performance Specification PMA201-03-003A. It is noted that the First Article Test (FAT) requirement is part of the specification. Use of qualified sources will mitigate risk of invalidation of previously obtained FMU-139C/B safety certifications and flight clearances for military aircraft. The above listed firms are the Original Equipment Manufacturers for their respective designs of the FMU-139C/B fuze and all associated technical data is proprietary. As the only designers, developers, manufacturers and suppliers of the FMU-139C/B fuze, the above listed firms possess the peculiar engineering capability, resources, expertise, intricate knowledge and proprietary technical data necessary to satisfy the Government's need and schedule requirements for the FMU-139C/B fuze. Initial production deliveries are required twelve months after contract award. This acquisition is being pursued under the statutory 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A determination by the Government to limit this competition to qualified sources is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data required to purchase this component from other sources. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought by contacting the above listed firms.</p>
<p>Comments shall be submitted via electronic mail (email) in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel format, or Portable Document Format (PDF). When submitting, please include company name, address, point of contact, email address, phone number and fax number. All responses must be unclassified. If including proprietary information in the response: (1) ensure proprietary information is marked appropriately; and, (2) identify disposition instructions. Any information that is not marked as proprietary will not be considered as proprietary and may be subject to disclosure to third parties. Comments must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. on XX December 2012 to either Mr. David Andreoli at david.andreoli@navy.mil or Mr. Jamie Billig at jamie.billig@navy.mil or mailed to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT, ATTN: Jamie Billig, AIR 2.4.4.3, SUITE 256, BLDG 2272, Patuxent River, MD, 20670.</p>
<p>The Government will review all comments or requests for information received prior to the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP), but will only post responses if deemed necessary. No response will be provided to any question or comment with proprietary or restrictive markings.</p>
<p>Industry is reminded that responses to this synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective Offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation, though requests for information related to this posting may be considered. This synopsis IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government in determining or planning its acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse interested sources for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in Fed Biz Opps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Once NAVAIR finalizes its requirements for the subject effort, a prerequisite for receiving a contract award is in the DOD's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. For more information on the CCR, contact the CCR Assistance Center at (888) 227-2423 or website at http://www.ccr.gov. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W900KK-13-R-0019  <br>  PEO Simulation, Training and Instrumentation, Air Traffic Control (ATC) Common Simulator (ACS) Sources Sought Notification (SSN) and Industry Day/Demo  <br>  This SSN is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this SSN will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  The information provided may be used by PEO STRI in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSN or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this SSN.  PEO STRI is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as described in the attached Statement of Work and Specification.   <br>  The intent of this SSN is to understand what products are, or will be, available to support an ACS capability.  The requirement is for an ACS system that provides realistic training for US Army air traffic controllers when not engaged with actual air traffic while operating in an ACS system. The ACS system will simulate a start to finish control effort, meaning Tower (Mobile Tower System (MOTS)) simulation at the airfield for take-off/landing under day or night conditions, Visual Flight Rules (VFR), Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Special Visual Flight Rules, and radar simulation for surveillance and precision approach (Air Traffic Navigation, and Coordination System (ATNAVICS)).  <br>  ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates this requirement will be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery order in a Full and Open competition in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The Government intends to award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated herein and to submit a written response by the closing date of this posting.  The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections in order to allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.  Estimated Award date is September 2013.  <br>  QUANTITIES:  The acquisition will be for a quantity of 78 Common Simulator Systems delivered over a five year period of performance, with first deliveries required no later than 6 months after contract award.  <br>  ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $25 million over five years.   <br>  Interested parties shall respond, and describe existing or near-term mature (next six months) capabilities, estimated costs, features or products that meet or exceed the requirements of the attached SOW and Specification.  Respondents are encouraged to describe additional features and capabilities supported by their solutions.  A written response shall address which capabilities are supported and describe the vendor's approach, support, and limitations for these capabilities and any unique or special variations or extensions to these capabilities.   Additionally, each respondent should address each of the following areas:  <br>  1. What do you see as the largest cost drivers based on the document provided in with the SSN?  <br>  2. How long would it take your company to produce the first simulator following contract award?  <br>  3. How do you plan to have your system meet the interoperability requirements referenced in the system requirements document paragraph, 3.3.1.3.1 and 3.3.1.3.2?  <br>  4.  What kind of technical and logistical system support will your company provide?   <br>  5. What is your annual production capacity, minimum and maximum?  <br>  6. What methodology will you use to create a user friendly scenario generation tool?  <br>  7. How will you accurately emulate the ATNAVICS and MOTS functions?  <br>  8. How will you insure reliability and maintainability requirements are met?  <br>  9. How does your software comply with synthetic environment core, distributed interactive simulated, and high level architecture requirements?  <br>  10. How will you provide the necessary accuracy for the voice recognition system?  <br>  11. During training scenarios, how will controller errors be identified, level of severity quantified, and saved for playback?  <br>  12. What mapping software will be used to accurately emulate the ATNAVICS mapping function?  <br>  13. Which requirements are the most difficult?  <br>  14.  How will you address software licenses/government rights?  <br>  15. If vendor is a small business, and you are interested in participating as the prime contractor, please provide how you plan on meeting the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  If vendor is a small business and you are only interested in subcontracting opportunities, please be specific in identifying the areas you are interested in supporting.  <br>    <br>  RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The Capability package must be clear, concise, complete and shall also include (in additional to the technical aspects), at a minimum; 1) Identify their organization's name, address, telephone number, and point of contact (also with title, phone, fax, and email) on packaging and title pages (The organization name should appear clearly on every page of your submittal and proprietary information must also be clearly marked.); 2) Organization Size/ownership of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Women-owned Business, and Hub-zone; 3) Cage Code, DUNS# and Tax ID# (TIN#).

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Through this contract the Government of Nepal's (GON) capacity to plan, manage and deliver high quality and equitable family planning, maternal, newborn and child health services will be greatly improved with cross-cutting health system strengthening interventions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>H4L interventions directly address key health system constraints in the following areas: local health systems governance; data for decision-making and evidence-based policy development, human resources; quality improvement systems; logistics systems; and, knowledge and behavior change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Contracting Officer determined that the contract would be competed as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Completion type contract. The selection of a cost reimbursement type contract was based on the cost uncertainty involved in the contract performance. due to the degree to which the contractor lacks exclusive control in the achievement of the objectives, and in particular, the degree to which the project is expected to engage third parties such as the GON, Ministry of Health. The [perceived] risk and lack of attribution when a contractor works with third parties to achieve project results and deliverables warrants a determination of a cost-plus-fixed fee versus no fee. It is also proper as compared with other types of fee arrangements that inappropriately credit or penalize contractor performance in third-party collaborative projects.</span></p>

The long standing security risks associated with the area may be reduced owing to increased economic opportunities leading to improved lives of the local population.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The project is considered feasible by the GOP as detailed in the completed and approved PC-1 (July 2011). It will contribute to meeting energy and other vital development needs of a restive region of Pakistan and improve the security situation in the country. It will use mostly domestic resources, promote labor in agriculture and reduce dependence on imported hydrocarbon fuel. The project is very high priority with the provincial government of KP, a province beset with terrorism, underemployment and poor living conditions. Its overall effect will be highly visible as it will bring investment to a neglected corner of the region. The social and economic benefits to the deprived 3.5 million residents will be appreciable.</span></p>

<DESC>&nbsp;A lack of energy, particularly a growing shortage of electricity, remains the number one constraint on economic growth within Pakistan and has the potential to create further political instability. Regular, rolling blackouts plague much of Pakistan and increasingly "load Shedding" occurs for 8, 10, or even 12 or more hours per day in Pakistan's major cities during certain months of the year. In Karachi, protests over power outages have turned violent. In Pakistan's industrial base, insufficient power has shut down textile factories, putting thousands out of work. Sixty-four percent of public schools have no electricity, and domestic natural gas supply is rationed with no import capability in place. For these reasons, energy is the number one priority for U.S. assistance in Pakistan.
<p>The U.S. aims to support the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and Pakistan's private sector to improve the quality and reliability of energy services to 60 percent of the population in five years and also make longer-term progress toward solving its energy crisis, thus contributing to economic growth and reducing the tendency for instability and social unrest. This will be achieved by improving the quality and quantity of energy supplied to customers (including increasing energy supplies and reducing load shedding). Phase I and II of the U.S Signature Energy Program in Pakistan invested in policy reform, capacity building and efficiency improvements, as well as small-and medium-sized infrastructure investment to increase electricity generation. As we enter Phase III, the FY 2011 budget will support large-scale projects with the Government of Pakistan to increase the power supply in the long-term, as well as smaller projects to immediately increase access to power.</p>
<p>Therefore, this project is designed to conduct Environmental Assessment of Kuram Tangi Dam Construction.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, Gainesville VA Medical Center The North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NFSGVHS).

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: The NFSGVHS has an ongoing need for Home Oxygen Services for approximately 1,900 home oxygen-using patients. This need is currently being met by contract, VA248-12-0-0145 with Commonwealth Home Health Care, Inc., which ends on 11/30/2012. The solicitation for a new Home Oxygen contract is currently undergoing final revisions and the FedBizOpps posting is forthcoming. In order to allow for uninterrupted care provision and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, a 2-month Interim Home Oxygen is required. It has been determined that this can only be accomplished through a sole-source award, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), to incumbent contractor, Commonwealth Home Health Care, Inc. for a 2-month period of performance of 12/1/2012- 1/31/2013.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: Home Oxygen Services are required for the 2-month Interim Contract at a total estimated value of $425,635.00. The period of performance for this interim Home Oxygen contract is 12/1/2012 - 1/31/2013.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy
Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(   ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(   ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(   ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(   ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(   ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(   ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): The rationale for this 2-month Interim Home Oxygen contract is to reduce potential harm to the Government that an interruption of patient care could cause, as well as the substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Additionally, in order to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, a 2-month Interim Home Oxygen is required, which will provide the additional time required to complete the posting and award of a new contract. Accordingly, it has been determined that this can only be accomplished through a sole-source award, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(11), to incumbent contractor, Commonwealth Home Health Care, Inc. for a 2-month period of performance of 12/1/2012 - 1/31/2013.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Facilitating competition for this acquisition was not deemed practicable as the probability of avoiding a break in the provision of these vital services was deemed to be low and the potential of encountering unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements was deemed to be high, should another contractor attempt to transition/take-over this requirement from the incumbent for this 2-month period of performance, at this time. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The anticipated cost for this interim contract is considered fair and reasonable as it is in agreement with pricing for the current contract, which was already determined to be both fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: The rationale for not conducting market research for this 2-month interim Home Oxygen contract is addressed in #'s 2, 5, and 6 above.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Competition for a new Home Oxygen contract is being sought through the posting of the solicitation for that specific requirement, anticipated for release on FedBizOpps, on or before 12/3/2012.

12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
