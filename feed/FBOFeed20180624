Veterans Point of Service (VPS) Hardware Refresh
June 24, 2018
36C10B18R2931

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  Significant revisions have been made since the RFI Posting 36C10B18R2664.  This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes   it does not constitute a Request for Quote/Proposal (RFQ/P) - or a promise to issue a RFQ/P in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFQ/P, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will NOT be returned.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification. 

Overview:  The Office of Veterans Access to Care requires a Commercial- Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware refresh product solution (e.g. self-service kiosks with appropriate peripherals devices and accessories, digital signage, and digital queuing displays) that shall include being powered Vecna s VetLink proprietary software.  The Contractor shall replace existing kiosks (all form factors), queuing displays, and digital signage throughout VA with new kiosk hardware, to include optional task for additional quantities as needed on a site by site basis as well as for extended warranties on legacy hardware.  The Contractor shall provide new kiosk hardware that is compatible with VetLink software, as the VA infrastructure will remain operating with the existing VetLink software.  In addition, the Contractor shall establish service desk support teams and procedures that support both the newly deployed kiosk hardware and legacy kiosk hardware until decommissioned by means of only one service desk support number from day one of award.  Since the VA infrastructure will remain operating with the VetLink software, the service desk support team shall also be required to sustain the operation of the VetLink software.  In addition to service desk support, the Contractor shall provide capacity planning and management services, support the kiosk production environment, provide training, and report accurate data for making informed decisions and monitoring program success.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the safe, consistent, controlled, and efficient operations of all kiosks in production environments.  

Additionally, the Contractor shall provide the warranty support necessary to keep all new kiosk hardware operational throughout all performance periods to meet an uptime metric of 98.0 percent as well as any warranty support necessary to maintain the legacy hardware until decommissioned.  The warranty requirements are further detailed in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) under Section 5.2.8 provided.  

Be advised the software application installed currently on the servers is VetLink proprietary software and no replacement is anticipated.  The VPS program is currently operating with VetLink software within the platform, which has a patient-facing User Interface (UI), a Veterans Health Administration staff-facing UI, and a provider-facing UI that empowers Veteran patients, Caregivers, and VA medical facilities /Community Based Outpatient Clinics to efficiently and easily transact and perform a variety of administrative, financial, and clinical tasks related to delivery of healthcare services and benefits management in VA and  non-VA care environments. VA does not possess the rights to the VetLink software codes nor does VA have the software licensing or data rights to the VPS system.  As a result, VA cannot provide the software as Government Furnished Property.
  
Please submit the following:
In accordance with the draft PWS, the Government is anticipating to refresh the existing legacy kiosk hardware with new procured COTS hardware products.  However, as part of this RFI, the Government is requesting that respondents provide one (1) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for procuring the COTS hardware and one (1) for Hardware as a Service (HaaS) strategy.

If SDVOSB or VOSB, is your company and/or partners registered in the Vendor Information Pages repository (https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/)?
