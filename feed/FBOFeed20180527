FOB Destination shall be Savannah, GA 31409<BR><BR>The MICC End User requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Modular Step Deck Trailer Ramp System (PN: STEP-DECK-20K)(Item #: 23-20-192-02-02M)
20" width
Manufactured from high-strength, lightweight aluminum
Kits include four aluminum ramps with double pin-on ends, and two heavy-duty adjustable lower ramp support stands (18"-24")
Available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities
Extra-wide serrated cross bars offer maximum traction in the rain, mud, or snow
Versatile and fully adjustable ramp system sets up in minutes
The step deck trailer ramp is the most versatile ramp system for loading tractors, loaders, trucks, and heavy equipment onto step deck trailers, loading docks, or flatbed trailers. These high-strength, lightweight aluminum ramps are easy to set up, and are available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities.

These heavy-duty ramps feature a reinforced stubbed toe so that they may be used as a modular system, or used as 8’ ramps on the rear of a trailer. The stubbed toe also prevents ramps from bending under the weight of heavy loads. This system breaks down into sections weighing just 74 lbs. each, allowing it to be set up quickly and easily by just one person.

The ramps pin to an adjustable center support stand and skid seat ramp bracket on the trailer or loading dock. The stands can change the loading angle onto trailers and docks by creating an offset angle or arch. The required skid seat brackets (sold separately) are available in steel or aluminum and must be welded or bolted to the trailer or loading dock. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Complete your ramp system by adding lockable ramp hangers and stand hangers (sold separately) to conveniently store your ramps and stands underneath your truck or trailer., 2, EA;<BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>36" Steel Ramp Attaching Bracket (PN: SKID-SEAT-36)
Includes a steel attaching bracket and pin
Measures 36" L x 2" W
Safest and most secure method of attaching a trailer to a dock
For use with pin-on end ramps only
Welds onto a truck, trailer, or dock
These heavy-duty ramp attaching brackets are designed to secure pin-end loading ramps directly to a truck, dock, or trailer deck for optimal safety and security. By pinning loading ramp tubes in the skid seat channel, ramps will stay fixed to a trailer deck or dock and won’t slip off while heavy equipment is being loaded. These brackets allow you to quick set up and take down your ramps, as well as quickly swap between ramp sizes. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide the ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Steel brackets must be welded at the top and bottom of brackets.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is HAAF175AML0039_2 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is  423860 with a small business size standard of 100.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.  The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2018-05-29 15:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Savannah, GA 31409<BR><BR>The MICC End User requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Modular Step Deck Trailer Ramp System (PN: STEP-DECK-20K)(Item #: 23-20-192-02-02M)
20" width
Manufactured from high-strength, lightweight aluminum
Kits include four aluminum ramps with double pin-on ends, and two heavy-duty adjustable lower ramp support stands (18"-24")
Available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities
Extra-wide serrated cross bars offer maximum traction in the rain, mud, or snow
Versatile and fully adjustable ramp system sets up in minutes
The step deck trailer ramp is the most versatile ramp system for loading tractors, loaders, trucks, and heavy equipment onto step deck trailers, loading docks, or flatbed trailers. These high-strength, lightweight aluminum ramps are easy to set up, and are available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities.

These heavy-duty ramps feature a reinforced stubbed toe so that they may be used as a modular system, or used as 8’ ramps on the rear of a trailer. The stubbed toe also prevents ramps from bending under the weight of heavy loads. This system breaks down into sections weighing just 74 lbs. each, allowing it to be set up quickly and easily by just one person.

The ramps pin to an adjustable center support stand and skid seat ramp bracket on the trailer or loading dock. The stands can change the loading angle onto trailers and docks by creating an offset angle or arch. The required skid seat brackets (sold separately) are available in steel or aluminum and must be welded or bolted to the trailer or loading dock. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Complete your ramp system by adding lockable ramp hangers and stand hangers (sold separately) to conveniently store your ramps and stands underneath your truck or trailer., 2, EA;<BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>36" Steel Ramp Attaching Bracket (PN: SKID-SEAT-S36)
Includes a steel attaching bracket and pin
Measures 36" L x 2" W
Safest and most secure method of attaching a trailer to a dock
For use with pin-on end ramps only
Welds onto a truck, trailer, or dock
These heavy-duty ramp attaching brackets are designed to secure pin-end loading ramps directly to a truck, dock, or trailer deck for optimal safety and security. By pinning loading ramp tubes in the skid seat channel, ramps will stay fixed to a trailer deck or dock and won’t slip off while heavy equipment is being loaded. These brackets allow you to quick set up and take down your ramps, as well as quickly swap between ramp sizes. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide the ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Steel brackets must be welded at the top and bottom of brackets.

<DESC>CANCELLATION NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is HAAF175AML0039_1 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 2005-97 with a small business size standard of 100.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2018-05-31 15:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Savannah, GA 31409<BR><BR>The MICC End User requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Modular Step Deck Trailer Ramp System (PN: STEP-DECK-20K)(Item #: 23-20-192-02-02M)
20" width
Manufactured from high-strength, lightweight aluminum
Kits include four aluminum ramps with double pin-on ends, and two heavy-duty adjustable lower ramp support stands (18"-24")
Available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities
Extra-wide serrated cross bars offer maximum traction in the rain, mud, or snow
Versatile and fully adjustable ramp system sets up in minutes
The step deck trailer ramp is the most versatile ramp system for loading tractors, loaders, trucks, and heavy equipment onto step deck trailers, loading docks, or flatbed trailers. These high-strength, lightweight aluminum ramps are easy to set up, and are available in 20,000 lb. or 23,500 lb. per axle weight capacities.

These heavy-duty ramps feature a reinforced stubbed toe so that they may be used as a modular system, or used as 8’ ramps on the rear of a trailer. The stubbed toe also prevents ramps from bending under the weight of heavy loads. This system breaks down into sections weighing just 74 lbs. each, allowing it to be set up quickly and easily by just one person.

The ramps pin to an adjustable center support stand and skid seat ramp bracket on the trailer or loading dock. The stands can change the loading angle onto trailers and docks by creating an offset angle or arch. The required skid seat brackets (sold separately) are available in steel or aluminum and must be welded or bolted to the trailer or loading dock. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Complete your ramp system by adding lockable ramp hangers and stand hangers (sold separately) to conveniently store your ramps and stands underneath your truck or trailer., 2, EA;<BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>36" Steel Ramp Attaching Bracket (PN: SKID-SEAT-36)
Includes a steel attaching bracket and pin
Measures 36" L x 2" W
Safest and most secure method of attaching a trailer to a dock
For use with pin-on end ramps only
Welds onto a truck, trailer, or dock
These heavy-duty ramp attaching brackets are designed to secure pin-end loading ramps directly to a truck, dock, or trailer deck for optimal safety and security. By pinning loading ramp tubes in the skid seat channel, ramps will stay fixed to a trailer deck or dock and won’t slip off while heavy equipment is being loaded. These brackets allow you to quick set up and take down your ramps, as well as quickly swap between ramp sizes. Consider purchasing brackets wider than your ramps so you can slide the ramps in or out to accommodate different vehicles. Steel brackets must be welded at the top and bottom of brackets.
