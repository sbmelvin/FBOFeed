<DESC><p>This is a corrected/updated Sources Sought Synopsis for previously issued Sources Sought Synopsis W9128A-17-Z-0014. If your firm continues to have interest in this project, please re-submit your firm's response.</p>
<p>The Honolulu District, US Army Corps of Engineers, is contemplating the award of a multiple Indefinite-Delivery Architect-Engineer Services (Architectural) Contract for Miscellaneous Projects in the Pacific Ocean Division Area of Responsibility, which include Alaska, Japan and Korea. The IDCs will consist of a one year base period and four one-year option periods. The total contract capacity will not exceed $49,000,000 for all contracts awarded under the solicitation, over the five year period. Each task order issued will be firm-fixed price (as negotiated). Note the original Sources Sought Synopsis W9128A-17-Z-0014 estimated this project would not exceed $80,000,000.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes.

Each task order issued will be firm-fixed price (as negotiated).</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541310 which has a small business size standard of $7,500,000.</p>
<p>If a requirement is a Small Business Set-Aside, then Small Business firms are reminded that under FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting, they must self-perform at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of concern for service-type procurement.</p>
<p>Selection of A-E firms will be made in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (Brooks Act), FAR 36.6 and Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7. Anticipated solicitation issuance date is on or about 1 Oct 2017.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process. Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In the event this procurement is a total small business set-aside, the following shall apply: For small business set-asides other than for construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer unless the SBA has granted either a waiver or exception to the nonmanufacturer rule.  In industries where the SBA finds that there are no small business manufacturers, it may issue a waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule. In addition, SBA has excepted procurements processed under simplified acquisition procedures, where the anticipated cost of the procurement will not exceed $25,000, from the nonmanufacturer rule. Waivers permit small businesses to provide any firm's product.<BR><BR>Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.<BR><BR>
