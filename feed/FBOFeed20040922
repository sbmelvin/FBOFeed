<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to EaglePicher Technologies (EPT).  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund and FAR 6.302-1on behalf of the Naval Air Warfare Center for the HARM Missile Program.  Fit, form,  function and performance requirements of the component specifications necessitate the use of  EPT Telemetry Batteries.  Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government.  To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the progress the HARM program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay completion of the test program by a minimum of one year. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement forNASA/MSFC has a requirement for a one-year extension to the Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Mission Services Contract, NAS8-00179, with Hernandez Engineering, Inc. (HEI). The existing cost-plus-award-fee contract has a period of performance from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2005. This one-year action will extend services through September 30, 2006. The services contemplated for the one-year extension fall within the scope of the existing statement of work. These services include the overall S&MA support to provide the necessary management, personnel, equipment, and supplies to provide mission services associated with the planning, implementation, and assessment of safety, reliability, maintainability, quality assurance, and risk management programs for the MSFC Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate. The services include the overall S&MA support to the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), the International Space Station (ISS) Program, the Constellation Systems/Exploration Program, the Project Prometheus, to all Government-furnished equipment developed at MSFC, to both SSP and ISS hardware and operations, and to SSP, ISS, and Expendable Launch Vehicle payloads. The services also include real-time support as required in the MSFC Huntsville Operations Support Center, reviewing in-flight anomalies, and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements and represents a safe course of action for the program(s).  NASA/MSFC intends to extend the existing contract with HEI supported by a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  The increased risks associated with HEI and S&MA personnel attempting to support critical Return to Flight (RTF) and re-competition activities at the same time are unacceptable. Only the incumbent is uniquely situated to satisfy the Government's requirements within this timeframe without increasing program risk to unacceptable levels associated with initiating re-competition activities while critical Space Shuttle RTF activities are ongoing and relying heavily upon the services provided by HEI and S&MA civil servant personnel. Postponing the re-competition for one year and continuing to obtain support services from HEI during the RTF period will mitigate program risk.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 7, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A -- Modular Guidance Architecture (Modular IMU) Research and Development
<SOLNBR>FA8204-04-R-AAAG
<CONTACT>Trina Andreasen, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-777-5928, Fax 801-586-0700, Email trina.andreasen@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice to announce the pending issuance of a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) for the Long Range Planning Branch of the Global Deterrence and Strike Program Office (OO-ALC/LMX) within the ICBM System Program Office (OO-ALC/LM).  LMX is seeking firms to conduct research and development of innovative concepts and technologies in the field of Modular Guidance Architecture (Modular IMU).  THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTICE AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE ANY EXPENSES INCURRED BY CONTRACTORS RESPONDING TO THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.

The objective of this project is to develop and mature technologies for future modular strategic missile guidance systems.  This effort should leverage ongoing government development activities in navigation and guidance instruments or contractor Independent Research and Development (IRAD) efforts, as appropriate.  Priorities include:  increased accuracy, decreased cost of ownership (low production cost, very high MTBF), modularity, and decreased weight.

The inertial instruments are a major driver in accuracy, cost, modularity, and weight in the guidance system.  It is anticipated that technology improvements will make future accelerometers/gyroscopes preferable to those chosen for initial fielding of a system.  Current guidance system architectures are highly integrated, and, therefore, insertion of individual inertial instruments that use new technologies has proven too complicated and costly.  It is desired that new guidance systems use a modular architecture that will enable affordable replacement of inertial instrument components.
GOVERNMENT EXPECTATIONS
It is expected that program participants will conduct analyses, perform trade studies, conduct simulations, and develop a concept(s) to meet objectives for strategic missile guidance systems.  In addition, the contractor may evaluate alternate concepts and identify technologies requiring further development.  The contractor is expected to develop, construct, and demonstrate proof of concept hardware and software. 

This effort will consist of two phases, as follows:

Phase I: Trade Study and Design
Conduct trade studies and design efforts to develop an objective system concept(s).  Recommend adjustments, where appropriate, to the goals and thresholds specified.  Identify and assess technology risks, and formulate a mitigation strategy.  Design a proof of concept modular guidance architecture test-bed that integrates multiple inertial instruments and demonstrates the accuracy, cost, modularity and weight improvements associated with the concept.  Forecast accuracy, cost, modularity, and weight improvements that would be expected from an objective system that implemented these concepts.

Phase II: Proof of Concept Test-bed Demonstration
Program participants will construct a proof of concept modular guidance architecture test-bed and conduct laboratory level tests to demonstrate project objectives by the end of 2007.  

TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
Accuracy:  Threshold: less than Peacekeeper CEP.  Goal: less than 0.8 Peacekeeper CEP. 
(Total operational CEP, including all error sources reduced, at 5000 Nmi range and 28 degree reentry angle.)  Global Positioning System (GPS) is not expected to be required.  Allowance for the later addition of a GPS receiver is desirable, as well as the ability to delay release of the Reentry Vehicles (RVs) in order to minimize the separation errors’ contribution to CEP if GPS is added.
Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):  Threshold: greater than 50,000 hrs, including any required ground cooling equipment. Goal: greater than 100,000 hrs, including any required ground cooling equipment.
Nuclear Survivability:  Threshold and Goal:  Retain current Nuclear Hardness requirements.
Modularity: Ensure overall system compatibility (e.g., connections etc…)
Weight: Threshold: 225 lbs maximum. Goal: 150 lbs maximum. The weight for the guidance system includes the IMU, mission computer, cables, battery, power distribution, and downstage control amplifiers required to drive the post boost and boost control systems, assuming the current MM III solid booster stack is retained. The weight of the structure is allocated to the propulsion subsystem, and is, therefore, not included in these weights.
Technology Maturity: This effort is intended to mature IMU technologies and concepts to achieve the above objectives.  It is envisioned this effort will enable the Technology Development phase for potential future programs.  A concept demonstration test-bed is expected to be produced and tested, demonstrating these concepts in a laboratory environment by the end of FY 2007.  The technology readiness level (TRL) achievable in this period is to be proposed and discussed by the contractor.   A minimum TRL level of 5 is expected by the end of FY 2007. The offerors shall provide in their proposal what they believe to be the current TRL level of their architecture and what TRL level they expect to achieve in this project by the end of FY07.

DELIVERABLES 
Monthly Reports:  Provide status.  Identify and analyze cost, schedule, and performance risks, to include assessment of potential impacts.  Propose risk mitigation, to include corrective actions and expected results, to ensure project achieves technical objectives within the projected cost and schedule constraints. Monthly status reports shall provide the Government adequate financial controls and insight to contract execution, addressing planned, actual, and forecasted expenditures, with cost to complete the basic/option.
Reviews:  Technical reviews will be conducted at key program milestones to be proposed by the contractor in order provide the government insight into technical, financial, and schedule performance and risk. Additional technical meetings may be required for coordination and planning.  A final review will be conducted to review results and recommendations.  Following the review and discussions, action items and issues will need to be addressed and entered into a final report that is due no later than 30 days after the final review.
Final Report:  A final report, including final, comprehensive technical results, analyses, and recommendations, will be submitted at the completion of phases I and II.  The phase I report will include a plan and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for phase II.

ELIGIBILITY
All firms with current applicable experience in strategic missile systems may submit white papers.  Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not authorized for this acquisition.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.1102 – Policy all prospective contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to award of a contract or agreement:  http:www.ccr.gov 

SUBMITTAL
White papers:   White papers shall reference solicitation number FA8204-04-R-AAAG, include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and a brief description of the offeror’s capabilities and applicable experience.  Include a description of technical approach covering the items addressed in Phase I and Phase II.  The offeror shall explain the current TRL and projected end of FY07 TRL for their proposed approach(es).  The submittal should include an original and (5) copies.  White papers are limited to a total page count of (10) ten pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  
  
Proposals: Upon completion of evaluation of white papers, the government will solicit proposals from selected contractors.  All proposals shall include a statement of work and  comply with all provisions of FAR 52.215-1 (Jan 2004) “Instructions to Offerors – Competitive Acquisitions”.

<DESC>The Government has a need for the further development of a micro impulse radar medical scancorder.   Without receiving acceptable capability information that addresses the specific technical & operational background that is required for this equipment it is the Government’s intent to solicit only Advantaca as their medical scancorder is the only device that currently meets our requirement.  The current scancorder detects the presence of life signs.  This effort will expand on that by requiring a display of heart and breathing rates measured from up to 100 feet away from the patient, by requiring the device to operate while being held instead of being placed on a patient, by requiring the device be lightweight and small enough to fit in a BDU cargo pocket, and also by requiring the scancorder to store this data for 20 casualties for up to 24 hours.  
The contractor will be responsible for design, development, and delivery of medical scancorder prototypes based on the Government’s performance specifications.  It is anticipated the RFP will be released on or about 13 Oct 04.  For further information contact Mr. William Keihl at (210) 536-6318, email:  william.keihl@brooks.af.mil or Maj Cathy Blacklock at (210) 536-1748, email:  cathy.blacklock@brooks.af.mil.

The applicator will replace the M17 Lightweight Decontamination System and expand its capability to apply decontaminants for thorough decontamination.  The goal for decontamination is to provide an effecti ve decontamination capability that is more environmentally friendly and reduces the logistics footprint. The objective of the JSTDS-SS program is to provide an increase in the warfighters decontamination capability through the fielding of JSTDS-SS over base year and four option years.  A Statement of Objectives (SOO) approach is chosen to identify the services and supplies.  The draft solicitation request for proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 describes the objectives that must be achieved, instructions for offerors, evaluation commercial items. Contractors will develop a performance work statement for production of a transportable decontamination system, including training support and materials, and implementation of performance based logistics optimizing availability at the lowest possible life-cycle cost.

<DESC>The Spanish Government has issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) of its Intention for Bidding (IFB) from all NATO countries related to its plan to extend the Allied Command Europe (ACE) Automated Command and Control Information Systems (ACCIS) Core Capability to the Management Information Systems (MIS) Bi-Strategic Command (Bi-SC) project 51503024 at Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Land Madrid Temporary (Spain).  The project is to be funded under the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).  Summary of Requirements: 

1. Bi-SC CP 5A0050/9B0020 identifies resource requirements to provide Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT), the Regional Headquarters (RHQs), the Joint-Headquarters (JHQs) and the component Headquarters (HQs) with an AIS Core Capability to operate effectively across the spectrum of conflict and will ensure a seamless C2 across all levels of command, both static and deployed.

2. Project 51S03024, titled ‘Extent the ACE AIS Core Capability to the MIS’ will take the ACE ACCIS Increment 1 software baseline and install it on all current Command MIS systems. The benefits of such a move are in rationalization of the support for these systems and the creation of a common level of capability across all the Commands. As well as installing the common software baseline, this project will also implement local networks where needed at the NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) and NATO RESTRICTED (NR) (i.e. BUSINESS SENSITIVE) level and provide a common solution to Internet connection.

3. NSIP Project Joint Office (NPJO) with this Notification of Intent (NOI) intends to procure the works package through the use of the Basic International Competitive Bidding Procedure.

4. Host Nation Spain, through NPJO, intends to invite bids for the provision of the Public Access LAN at LCC-Land HQ temporary facilities Madrid.

5. The reference of the Invitation for Bidding (IFB) related to this NOI is NPJO/2001/51S03024-0/IFB-1/NOI-1 and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.

6. The IFB related to this NOI is planned to be issued in July 2005, with a bid closing date in December 2005 and a contract award in January 2006.  However, every effort will be made to anticipate these dates.

7. It is requested that JNPO be provided with a list of qualified and certified firms, which may be interested in receiving an IFB for this project, not later than May 31 2005.

8. The National Delegations are advised that the IFB package will contain material of a classified nature. All firms acting as bidders, and the successful contractor, may be required to have access to information or restricted areas classified as ‘NATO SECRET’, therefore prospective bidders must have the appropriate security clearance.

ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMININATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED ‘DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY’. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED.  YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security intends to issue a sole-source Firm Fixed Price contract to Kling Architect and Engineers, Inc. to provide A&E services to support the final completion and acceptance of the existing construction of a power generation facility at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), Plum Island, NY.  In 1998, Kling Architect and Engineers Inc. was contracted with by the United States Department of Agriculture on a competitive basis to design a new power generation facility for the PIADC, consisting of generators and boilers to replace the existing structure and its associated equipment.  That contract was subsequently transferred to DHS.  During the transfer of the contract to DHS there was a delay in the construction of the power generation facility and Kling Architect and Engineers was not able to complete the contemplated effort.   No other firm can provide these services and meet the Government’s timeline for completion of the power generation facility without causing considerable delay.  Any cost savings that could be potentially gained by using a different contractor would be lost in the expense of the learning curve causing further detriment to the mission.  As the designer of record, Kling Architect and Engineers, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) is considered the only responsible source and no other service will satisfy the agency’s requirements.   See note 22.

<SUBJECT>A --THERMAL MASINT  ANALYSIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>TIR
<RESPDATE>102204
<ARCHDATE>11302004
<CONTACT>DAVID R. FORTSON,(937)257-5666, EXT. 4550
<DESC>NASIC/DEMZ Thermal MASINT Analysis Request for Information 1. PURPOSE:  This is a special notice requesting information to ascertain the  resources and capabilities of commercial industry to satisfy the needs of the  National Sensors Exploitation Branch (DEMZ) within the National Air + Space  Intelligence Center (NASIC).   Specific areas of interest include the  industrial capabilities along with an estimate of the magnitude and  availability of contractor resources available for the processing and  exploitation of Thermal Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) data.  The government desires an industrial partner to provide intelligence production  and associated infrastructure support to intelligence community customers. 2. DISCLAIMER: This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request for  Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a  contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information  submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not intend to award  a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information  solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in  subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal  Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Any responses received will not  be used as a proposal. 3. BACKGROUND: DEMZ serves as the Department of Defense (DoD) executive agent  for the processing, exploitation and dissemination of Thermal-IR (TIR)  intelligence data collected by National and Air Force technical sensors.  Exploitation activities conducted include rapid response crisis support and  detailed analysis on target facilities worldwide for warfighter, peacekeeping,  and national agency clients. DEMZ maintains data repositories of historical  event data to support signature development and analytical tool development.   DEMZ provides collection system technical advice, guidance for sensor  improvements, and the development of new capabilities. These efforts directly  support NASIC+s mission and goals to provide integrated intelligence products  to the warfighter and to the intelligence, operations, policy, and acquisition  communities. 4. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Request for Information is to ascertain  interest, capabilities, and availabilities of contractors to provide support  for current and future DEMZ programs. The scope of DEMZ programs will include,  but not be limited to, analyzing and exploiting present and future MASINT  sensor data. This includes data processing, data analysis, software  maintenance, analytic support, and providing training on any software modified  or maintained by the contractor. The contractor would also have a focus on  providing the government accurate and timely management updates on all efforts,  to include funding status, technical progress, and potential production  solutions.  Analysis would be performed within the NASIC, with possible  augmented support occurring at the contractor's local facility.  The contractor  may be required to show the ability to leverage past experience in the  operational intelligence exploitation arena in order to document processes,  streamline exploitation timelines, and deliver standardized intelligence  products to operational users in a short period of time after collection.  Currently, intelligence production timelines are driven by the Global War on  Terrorism and the unique needs of many of NASIC's operational customers.  5. MANNING REQUIREMENTS: The manning requirements required to execute  NASIC/DEMZ's mission are as follows:  a.	Contractors must support 24/7 manning of at least 2 persons at a time  in NASIC's time-critical exploitation cell. Day duty hours can be factored out  of this 24/7 requirement, so "24/7 support" can be construed as 16 hours/day. b.	Contractors must support at least six full-time, day-shift thermal  analysis positions. Prior imagery analysis or thermal analysis experience will  be desired for these positions. c.	Contractors must provide two lead analysts who function as team leads.  These lead analysts will work day shift and must have a scientific/engineering  background and supervisory experience. d.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Nicole Wohl, 1.703.325.2854
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-04-R-0033, soliciting proposals in support of the Standoff Mine Detectoion STO (SMDS), has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  This BAA is sponsored by the U. S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) NVESD, Ft. Belvoir, VA, in support of the Standoff Mine Detection STO (SMDS).  This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulatio n (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directora te (NVESD) Countermine (CM) Division to support the Standoff Mine Detection, Science and Technology Objective (STO) [SMDS].  The objective of this research project is to evaluate and demonstrate approaches for standoff detection of mines and mine-like targ ets from a ground vehicle platform.  The target set of interest includes: surface laid anti-tank mines, buried metal anti-tank (AT) mines, buried plastic anti-tank mines with high metal content, and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The technical goal i s to demonstrate detection and location of targets far enough in front of vehicles to advance at a minimum of 20 kilometers per hour (kph).  Techniques should lend themselves to modular and bolt-on applications.  Size, weight and power consumption are impo rtant.  The proposed research technologies are required to collect data and eventually demonstrate at NVESD mine lane facilities and test areas.  Also, some testing outside of the continental US (OCONUS) may be required.  Proposals should include a technol ogy demonstrator, to include all system hardware and software costs as well as the cost of a demonstrator vehicle.  The specific STO performance parameters are described in the complete BAA posting located on the website noted above.  Award(s) against this  BAA can be made for two years after notification of selectability.  Specific costs and terms and conditions will be negotiated prior to award. The Government contemplates the awarding of Cost Reimbursement (i.e., Cost Plus Fixed Fee) type contract(s); how ever, proposals based on other contract types will be considered. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. The maximum length of an award will be three years.  Prospective offerors should note that  this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allow able direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Prior to submittal of proposals, questions concerning technical issues ma y be directed to the attention of the Countermine Division Subject Matter Expert.  However, there shall be no discussion between offerors and Government technical staff after proposal submission.  Instead, all questions and discussions must directed to the  Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer.   The Countermine Division Point of Contact is Mr. Steven Bishop, Tel: 703-704-1037   (DSN: 654-1037), E-mail:  Steven.Bishop@nvl.army.mil.  The CECOM Acquisition Center Contract Specialist is Ms. Nicole Wohl, T el:  703-325-2854 (DSN:  221-2854), E-mail:  nicole.wohl@cacw.army.mil.  The CECOM Acquisition Center Contracting Officer is Ms. Peggy A. Melanson, Tel:  703-325-6096 (DSN:  221-6096), E-mail:  peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil.  The selection of one or more pr oposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the over all merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  The basis for award, submittal instructions, and evaluation criteria are set forth in the BAA.  Funds are not presently available for the research interests represented in this BAA; however, fund s are planned in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) for this research.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Offerors are again directed to access the BAA at the Army Single Fa ce to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  The URL for the IBOP is https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  In order to be able to access the BAA solicitation W909MY-04-R-0033, and submit a proposal, a contractor must first be registered on th e IBOP.   A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the regis tration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.

Cotton Samples  - as referred to in this document denotes a cotton sample consisting of two portions, each portion is approximately six (6) inches wide, twelve (12) inches long and four (4) inches deep.  Each portion weighs approximately four (4) ounces for a total sample weight of eight (8) ounces.

Process Described

The Quality Assurance Branch contains instruments and classers that test, grade and dispose of approximately 1000 cotton samples per hour.  The Quality Assurance Branch contains 14 instrument stations that test and dispose of a small portion of the sample.  There are 8 manual classer stations of which predominantly only 4 dispose of the entire sample.  However, on occasion all 8 stations would be required to dispose of samples based on the daily cotton grading demands.  The workstations combined will dispose of approximately 500-700 pounds of cotton per hour.  Although the majority of the entire sample is disposed of at the classer station, there are times that the instrument station will be required to dispose of the entire sample.  Therefore, the loose system shall provide the flexibility of disposing of an entire sample at either workstation.  Both of the workstations are able to accommodate the holding of approximately two or three samples prior to disposal.  Therefore, the system shall empty each of the workstations in the required amount of time so as to limit the amount of samples that are accumulated between evacuations to only three.  The loose removal system at each of the workstations shall be controlled by a timed sequence activation of the valves through some type of automated control system via a PLC.  A manual push button device at the HVI and classer workstations is not acceptable.

Three additional loose removal stations (floor sweeps) shall be provided in three separate rooms for the manual removal of waste cotton that is accumulated on the floor.  The classing lab, receiving room and the bale press room shall contain the floor sweeps.  The three additional stations shall be manually controlled by a push button or similar device that shall be designed to work in conjunction with the automated loose removal described above for the HVI and classer workstations.  The additional loose removal stations shall be able to accommodate the same size of sample that was outlined in the previous paragraph.

The Quality Assurance Branch is required to operate under various scenarios based on the samples that are to be tested.  This requires a great deal of flexibility within their lab.  The following scenarios must be provided for in the design of flexibility of the installed loose removal system.  A design layout and procedure shall be submitted prior to the award to verify that these requirements are satisfied.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has tested the cotton samples, the samples are transported into the receiving room and discarded at a central dumpstation.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for HVI testing.  Once the samples are tested, they are transported to the manual classing station.  After the samples have received a manual classification, they are discarded at the manual classer station.  There are four to eight manual classer stations that shall be used at various times for the disposal of the cotton samples.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has completed the testing, the samples are discarded at the HVI workstation.  There are 14 HVI workstations that shall be capable of discarding the entire sample.



Installation Requirement

The piping and valve installation in the classing lab shall adhere to the following requirements.  The piping and valves shall be installed within the constraints of the above ground conveyor system and the finished floor level.  It shall also be contained within the support frames of the conveyor.  The piping shall be attached to the floor or frame of the conveyor to provide a stationary installation.  These dimensions are approximately 34 inches wide by 20 inches tall.  Each valve shall accommodate the loose removal for two workstations.  The piping in the receiving room shall turn into the trench within 4 feet of the separating wall of the lab and receiving room.  The underground trench is approximately 4 feet deep by 4 feet wide and contains a belt conveyance system that is approximately 2 feet tall and 3 feet wide.  The piping shall not interfere with the sample flow on the trench as it will be maintained for a backup system to the newly installed air loose removal system.

The installation shall provide for the utilization of the trench conveyance system as a backup system.  Therefore the conveyance system and the air system shall be designed and installed to allow both systems to simultaneously feed into the Quality Assurance bale press in the event of a malfunction of the Classing Office bale press.  This shall require some additional sheet metal work in the Quality Assurance bale press in the form of a slide or chute that will feed the cotton into the bale press and allow the conveyor to cross feed onto the slide or into a chute.

The receiver tanks will be suspended above the baler on an 8’x 20’ platform with access ladder and guard rails.  The system will be PLC controlled with panel mounted operator interface for adjustment of CYCLE TIME, TANK DUMP TIME, and FLOOR FILTER CLEAN TIME.  The 36”x 36” x 8” NEMA 12 panel will also include vacuum exhauster controls fire protection interlock with dry contacts, and vacuum exhauster surge controls.

The exhauster and the secondary filter shall be mounted on the floor of the bale press room.  The exhaust air from the exhauster shall be piped outside the building from the bale press room within close proximity of the exhauster.   These locations shall be approved by a USDA representative prior to installation.


Equipment Specifications

The exhauster required shall be a Hoffman Model 74106 six-stage or equivalent, cast iron, centrifugal arranged for direct coupled connection to a 100 HP 3,600 RPM premium efficiency electric motor with structural steel base plate, motor pedestal, coupling guard and mounting pads, also to include: (2)  Flanged Tube Adaptors 8"

<DESC>Following are questions and replies submitted today are for information purposes. This will not change the response date. 

1.  If 1000 inches of loose medical record material is the minimum, how much do you actually have, and if significant, is there consideration of lengthening the contract to ensure completion of all backlog that currently exists at all three locations?

1. We are still looking at 1000 inches as a minimum.  No consideration on lengthening the contract.

 

2.  Will we be working with your internal staff to complete this project or will we be on our own? 

2. Initial instructions will be provided to the contractor.  After the introduction phase, the contractor will be on their own.

 

3.  Are all 1000 inches of loose records in one location or are they spread between the three (Wilford Hall, Lackland AFB and Kelly AFB)?  

3.  Primarily focus on WHMC and other locations are secondary as time permits.

 

4.  Will there be sufficient space for quantity (estimated at 12 people) of required personnel to perform the work in the time frame you have specified?  

4. We only requested 3-FTE personnel and they will be sharing office space with our internal staff.

 

5.  Can you provide examples or descriptions of exactly what we would be filing (i.e. clinical chart documentation, laboratory reports, x-rays, operative reports, surgery records, financial data)?

5.  During the initial introduction, internal staff will provide any additional information on specific medical documents/forms.  Note: AFI 41-210 (Patient Administration    

     Functions), para 6.3.6 states the arrangement of content and record filing methodology in maintaining the Health Records.

 

6.       Since review of medical record processes is desired, do you also wish for a review/analysis of ALL medical records at the three locations (Wilford Hall, Lackland AFB, and Kelly AFB) to ensure compliance with proper documentation order (contract requirement 2.4.2.5.)?   If you do not want a full review, do you want a sampling review/analysis to be completed?  

6.  We request a full review/analysis on our health records process.

<DESC>Formal posting of Request for Proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 for Joint Services Transportable Decontamination System - Small Scale (JSTDS-SS).  The Governments intent is to procure a commercial off the shelf (COTS) technology/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) in support of the Joint Services Family of Decontamination (JSFDS) under the Joint Program Manager for Decontamination (JPM-DC).  The JSTDS-SS goal is to acquire a small scale decontamination system to include applicators and decontaminants, with full logistical support. The applicator will replace the M17 Light-weight Decontamination System and expand its capability to apply decontaminants for thorough decontamination.  The objective of the JSTDS-SS Program is to provide an increase in the warfighters decontamination capability through the fielding of JSTDS-SS over base year and four option years.  The goal for decontamination is to provide an effective decontamination capability that is more environmentally friendl! y and reduces the logistics footprint.  A Statement of Objectives (SOO) approach is chosen to identify the services and supplies.  This solicitation request for proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 describes the objectives that must be achieved, instructions to offerors, evaluation of proposals.  Contractors will develop a performance statement of work (SOW) for production of a transportable decontamination system, including training support and materiels, and implementation of performance based logistics optimizing availability at the lowest possible life-cycle cost.  Note: a separate procurement action will be implemented to support testing (Phase II Downselection) for those offerors in the competitive range for Phase II, therefore offerors must address ability to meet quantities identified in Clause 52.212-2 (Phase II will require test samples, interim contractor support for duration of thise phase).  The primary North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) is 33! 3999.  All questions regarding the contents of this RFP are to be directed to the points of contact: Nannette Carter-Jafri (email: carter-jafrind@logcom.usmc.mil) at 229-639-6166, or Larry McNutt (email: Larry.McNutt.ctr@usmc.mil) at 229-639-8088.

<DESC>DRAFT: Questions and Answers Joint Service Transportable Decontamination System—Small Scale  (JSTDS-SS) Industry Day 8 June 2004 Additional website information can be found at: UID Website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid CCR Website: http://www.ccr.gov NECO:  http://www.neco.navy.mil WAWF Registration: http://rmb.odgen.disa.mil/ You are invited to address any other questions to the Marine Corps Logistics Command, email to mcnuttlr@logcom.usmc.mil anytime before COB 4pm EST on Tuesday, 15 June 2004.  All questions should include the company name, address, CAGE code, and point of contact info including email address.  Information Purposes Only -All information provided prior to release of the final RFP is considered to be non-binding.  Comments provided by industry will be considered and included in the final RFP at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  The Govern ment is bound only by the information contained in the final RFP and its amendments. Questions & Answers: The Government reserves the right to defer answers until questions are properly staffed, therefore any question rendered not appearing below will be addressed and posted as soon as possible (ASAP). Legend:		Answers O	Other			7  (unchg) TS	Testing			9  (TS-9) TC	Technical		35 (TC-23 thru TC-35) L	Logistics		5  (unchg) C	Contract/Legal		19 (C-11 thru C-19) No.	Question & Answer TS-9	Q: How will reliability and availability be measured?A: Reliability is the probability that an item can perform its intended function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.  Reliability will be evaluated as follows: 1)Testing will be conducted for using the procedures and conditions specified in the service Concept of Operations.  2)Test length will be sufficient to de monstrate the 303 hour mean-time-between-operational-mission-failure (MTBOMF) requirement with high statistical confidence. 3)Test incidents will be scored using an approved Failure Definition and Scoring Criteria. 4)Failure data will be used to calculate the MTBOMF and reliability for each system.Operational availability, or Ao = uptime ¸ (uptime + downtime) where uptime is that time when the system is considered to be ready for use and downtime is the time the system is down for repair of critical failures and/or for restoration from mission critical faults, including off-board logistic delays.  Also, please consider the Mean Logistics Delay Time (MLDT) of 133 hours mentioned in the rationale for the JSTDS RAM to be a maximum MLDT calculation. ----------------------------------------------------------- TC-23	Q: At what distance from the unit is the sound pressure level (8 5dB) measured. A: The performance specifications state that noise levels produced by JSTDS-SS, excluding audible indicators, shall be less than 85 dBA to allow operation of the JSTDS-SS without hearing protection. Noise levels will be measured at distances of 18 inches from the control panel and one meter from the rest of the system, on all sides.   TC-24	Q: Why are you defining the process instead of the objective?  You are severely limiting your options.A:   The technical specifications and the Statement of Objective are performance based.   The JSTDS-SS RFP does not define the process other than to continue to have the capability to be able to apply hot soapy water for decontamination of aircraft and other equipment.  This capability is required based on market surveys which indicate that there are no Commercial Off-The-Shelf solutions that will meet the warfighters deconta mination needs for these assets as well as the time required to obtain approval for use of any new product on aircraft. User representatives presented current decontamination operations so that offerors would be in a better position to focus their proposals on how their proposed product/processes will provide benefit to the Department of Defense and mitigate the burdens shortfalls of current decontamination operations.  Offerors are required to identify in their proposal the processes followed to perform decontamination operations using their proposed system. TC-25	Q: Is a RAM document available?A:  No unique Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) document is available.  The performance specifications identifies in the concept of operations that mission duration equals 22 hours every 24 hours.  Mission duration allows 22 hours run-time (2 hours for refueling/prev entive maintenance).  Run-time includes the time to replenish decontaminants. The Operational Availability requirement notes that for calculation, Mean Logistics Delay Time is 133 hours.   TC-26	Q: In para 3.2.6 in performance specs – what do you mean by “standard components) (Military, industry, NATO, etc)A:  The JSTDS-SS shall use standard components and interfaces to the maximum extent possible.  “Standard components" refer to equipment that is not so uniquely designed that there is only one source for procurement or replacement (i.e., equipment should be available from commercial or military sources.)  No special tools or other specially-designed equipment (outside the Joint Services inventory) shall be required to remove, install, or replace the equipment. TC-27	Q: Are the materials to be tested for compatibility specifically listed in the RFP?A: No.  The requirement is  to be compatible with all materials on the assets to be decontaminated. The subset of materials to be tested against in Phase II testing will be identified in the final RFP.  JPO is deriving a representative set of materials to be tested.  The finished list will be comprehensive of all possible systems which may be exposed to JSTDS-SS, small enough to feasibly be tested and accepted by all services.  The materials not tested in Phase II testing will be tested after contract award. TC-28	Q: Can efficacy data on decontaminate be supplied as independent from spraying applicator or does efficacy data have to come from being sprayed from the actual applicator?A:  Yes, efficacy data can come from the decontaminant alone, however, convincing rationale needs to be provided to relate this data to the efficacy that can be expected from the proposed system using the proposed process. TC -29	Q: “52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” per paragraph A.(2)(f):   Is terrain decontamination included in the scope of this solicitation? If not, what is the significance of the reference to “amount of decontaminant required to decontaminate 1000 square meters…”A: The 1000 square meters technical parameter was inadvertently based on terrain decontamination.  This number will be modified to 5000 ft2 to be more representative of the mission of JSTDS-SS. TC-30	Q: “52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” A.(2)(j)1.:  What are the temperature requirements for hot soapy water?A: 120-140 degrees F.  This will be included in the Final RFP. TC-31	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraphs 3.1.1.5.1 and 3.4.3: Is it intended that the JSTDS-SS could be mounted on either the vehicle or the trailer of each of the listed vehicle/trailer combinations? If  yes, please provide the dimensions of the space available for the JSTDS-SS on board each of the vehicles and the respective trailers.A: The JSTDS-SS must be able to be mounted on each of the identified vehicles and trailers. Diagrams (which include dimensions) of those platforms with the smallest dimensions are in the Industry Day brief (which will be posted on NECO as soon as possible). TC-32	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.1.1.6.2: This references applying compounds to aircraft. Is this just a measure of throughput and not a decontamination performance spec? The Industry briefing on June 8th (verbal information) indicated that aircraft decontamination is objective requirement. Please clarify.A: Paragraph 3.1.1.6.2 of the performance specification is a throughput requirement.  The throughput requirement for aircraft is based on the rate of application and not  on decontamination efficacy.  It is an objective to provide a JSTDS-SS decontaminant for use on an aircraft to meet the efficacy requirements.   TC-33	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.2.2: Does the 500 lbs weight referenced include standard accessories? Optional accessories?A: No.  The 500 pounds is the maximum weight of the JSTDS-SS applicator module (without fuel) and does not take into consideration the JSTDS decontaminant or accessories. TC-34	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.1.1.4:  Does this mean that the decontaminant is required to be effective in removing POLs, or does it mean that the decontaminant must be effective in decontaminating agents (C,B,R, TIM, etc.) that are embedded in POLs?A: Offerors proposed system used in accordance with their proposed methods must be able to decontaminate tactical vehicles (including undercarriage),  external shipboard surfaces, crew–served weapons and individual equipment, which have been exposed to Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POLs). Agents may or may not be embedded in the POLs.   TC-35	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.7.2: The last four items listed are not climatic conditions.  What are the test parameters for these four items that the JSTDS-SS has to be measured to?A: The last four items are not climatic conditions but are ambient or induced environments that the system will need to operate in and/or survive.  The specific test parameters will be addressed in detail in the performance specifications included in the final RFP. ----------------------------------------------------------	 C-11	Q: 5 units 1 MAPO is aggressive.  Lead times for some commercial items can be 6-8 weeks.A; The delivery schedule will be modified in the final RFP to two units  due every two weeks beginning four weeks after purchase order, with final delivery no later than 12. C-12	Q: Please confirm the period of performance: July 2005-June 2010??A: The period of performance for the base contract is one year, with an estimated award date of 3rd qtr FY05 (July 2005).  There are four option years, with the final option year estimated to concluding by 2nd qtr FY10 (June 2010) based on the estimated award date. C-13	Q: Is the JSTDS-SS Program funded? What is the funding profile by fiscal year?A: The only publicly available budget information is in the Presidents Budget.   C-14	Q: Will bidder technical support be included in Purchase Order for DT/OT prior to contract award?A: Yes, if selected for Phase II.  Offerors should identify in logistical support available during Phase II for their system. C-15 	Q: Since logistics support is undetermined at thi s point and will be driven by the Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Business Case Analysis (BCA), how will contracting for this be handled?  Directed to successful JSTDS-SS bidder?A: Contractor must identify in their proposal Statement of Work their PBL.  Offerors contracting method to implement PBL will be assessed during the PBL BCA.  Also see L5 Q&A. C-16	Q: Will there be small business, small disadvantaged business and/or 8A set aside with this procurement?  Will there be subcontracting and teaming requirements and SB/SBD participation requirements?A: The Draft RFP does not identify total or partial set-asides for socio-economic programs.  However, the Final RFP will address requirement for offerors (large business concerns) to identify their Subcontracting strategy/plan I/A/W FAR 19.704.  Note: the subcontracting plan would become part of any contract award.  Final RFP wi ll be compliant with FAR Part 19, small business concerns are encouraged to submit their prime vendor proposals. C-17	Q: “52.212-2  EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” Under “Phase I  Completeness of Proposal.”  The listing starts with items (k) through (s).  Are there items (a) through (j) that were inadvertently omitted?A: The paragraphs were numbered incorrectly.  There were no omissions.  The numbering will be corrected in the final RFP. C-18	Q: Will CLINs for the option years be included in the final RFP?  What are these option years CLINs?A: Yes, the final RFP will cover the base year, plus four option years. C-19	Q:  Is it acceptable to propose a JSTDS-SS system with more than one applicator and/or more than one decontaminant?A: Yes.  However, each JSTDS-SS system offered must have a complete proposal package (Volume I, II, and III).  All proposals will be evaluated based on  best value to the government.

<DESC>The one-time pre-solicitation project site tour has been postponed until September 30, 2004, at 2:00 P.M. local time, at the Sugarloaf Recreation area. The project includes reconstruction of the Sugarloaf Campground. Reconstruction work includes installing and improving drainage structures, road and spur widening, constructing turnouts, hauling and placing fill and gravel surfacing materials. Also included in this project are the installation of two new accessible vault toilets and construction of tent and facility pads, and related signing. The USDA Forest Service intends to award one contract for this work. This project is located on the Laramie Ranger District of the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest/Thunder Basin National Grassland, approximately 11 miles west of Centennial, Wyoming. To access the Sugarloaf Recreation Area from Laramie, take Wyoming State Highway 130 through Centennial, Wyoming, and then approximately 11 miles west to the project area. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System. The estimated start date is July 1, 2005. Contract duration will be 120 days. The magnitude of the project is between $250,000 and $500,000. This is an unrestricted acquisition. Note: Due to access to the project site in the spring being difficult at best, the site visit is being held this fall.  All potential offers are invited to attend. If you plan to attend the pre-solicitation site visit, contact Ruth Brado at 970-498-1151 not later than September 29, 2004. If there are no calls indicating attendance, the meeting will be cancelled. If funding becomes available, the solicitation, including the specifications, will be published at www.fedbizopps.gov and will state the date that offers are due. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued and awarded this winter.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the Request For Information (RFI) which was posted 15 Sept 04.  Note changes in wavelength description in this paragraph, and the Technical POCs, along with information on the industry day.  Note that submissions are still due NLT 6 Oct 2004.  

This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, (AFRL), and DARPA/MTO do not presently intend to award a contract, but are in need of information on potential sources in the area of Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements.   The technical areas of interest are all technologies required to build an array of sub-apertures capable of transmitting, receiving, and rapidly steering spatially phased optical energy and images in which each sub-aperture should be transmissive.    AFRL and DARPA are potentially interested in demonstrating a modular, scaleable architecture capable of scaling to large apertures and high powers. A potential objective at program’s end would be for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  We are interested in company capabilities to manufacture and commercialize required components.  Applications of interest include: laser weapons, laser targeting/sensing, laser communication, and laser countermeasure.  Compensating for atmospheric effects is required as part of any technical approach.  The primary wavelengths of interest are approximately 1.5 microns and 1 micron.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 or 3 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months, with total program length expected to be up to 5 years. 

Potential goals for the first phase include: transmissive optical phased array sub-aperture elements of 2 cm diameter or more.  Actual shape of the sub-aperture elements is a trade space item. Less than 2 msec beam switching time, >50 % fill array factor, and, an array strell ratio of at least 60 %, and imaging on receive with resolution at least a factor of two beyond the diffraction limited resolution of a single sub-aperture.   The array of sub-apertures should include at least one sub-aperture surrounded on all sides by other sub-apertures.  Nonmechanical beam steering should be continuous to at least 20 degrees in any direction, covering a field of regard of at least 40 degrees.  Algorithms should be demonstrated to allow for necessary atmospheric compensation to meet final program goals.  Over-all transmission efficiency from electrical power to far field energy steered to 20 degrees in any direction should exceed 1 %, and be higher for smaller angle beam steering. 

Goals for the final phase(s) would be as follows:
Demonstration of a half meter array of sub-apertures using 100 or fewer sub-apertures, including the ability to compensate for any atmospheric effects in real time.  The demonstrated technology should be scaleable to powers of at least 100 kW for the weapon application and one or more kilowatts for the sensing application.   A significant fraction of those power levels should be demonstrated in this program.  An array fill factor of greater then 90 % is desired and a strell ratio >90 %.  Efficiency from electrical power to a far field transmitted beam steered to a 45 degree angle in any direction should exceed 7%.   Total efficiency at smaller steering angles should be higher.  Imaging resolution through moderate turbulence should be within a factor of 1.5 of a monolithic unsteered beam emitted from a half meter aperture through clear air or vacuum.  Steering time should be under 1 millisecond from any location in the field of regard to any other location.  As a goal any sub-aperture, or any combinations of sub-apertures, should be capable of being used independently for all functions. 

Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in the design, development, and production of optical phased array beam steering, phased lasers, sub-aperture receive technologies, atmospheric compensation techniques, and/or the integrations of these technologies and should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement including their capability to manufacture and commercialize the end-product.  Comments on the above objectives are also welcome. Corporate capabilities are of strong interest, preferably with a discussion of technologies actually demonstrated, and of laboratory/manufacturing facilities already in place.  

Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to:

Pages shall be double-spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Submittals via e-mail are preferred.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In addition, a security clearance will be required.  Interested parties must maintain, or have the ability to provide, secure facilities and possess, or have the ability to obtain, a US Secret level security clearance.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) – AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY.   In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of market research relative to recompetition of the MAUI SPACE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (MSSS) and STARFIRE OPTICAL RANGE (SOR) OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE and TECHNICAL/RESEARCH OVERSIGHT. RFI includes all commercial and academic institutions.  POC:  Ms Caroline Pultz, Procurement Contracting Officer, 505-846-2240, Caroline.Pultz@kirtland.af.mil.   BACKGROUND:  The current MSSS and SOR contracts expire in 2005 and will be recompeted.  An Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been formed to conduct market research associated with site operations and maintenance, and the long-term research strategy for the MSSS and the SOR facilities. REQUIREMENTS:  1) Industry Day:  AFRL will host an Industry Day at the Energy Training Complex (ETC), 1401 Maxwell St, Kirtland AFB-West, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 12 October 2004, from 0800-1100 to review the MSSS and SOR site capabilities and other programmatic discussions.  This event will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.201 -- Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.  2)  Oral presentations from potential offerors will be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 12 October 2004 beginning at 1300.  The AFRL is encouraging oral presentations covering planned operations and maintenance of the MSSS and SOR, business development strategies for moving MSSS and SOR towards self-sustaining sites by 2010, and support of existing directed energy and space situation awareness technology transition programs.  Additionally, presentations should address the potential for combining contract solicitations for MSSS and SOR that could provide consolidated support (operations, maintenance, and research thrusts) to both MSSS and SOR under a single contract.  Analysis should include resource consolidation, technology transition opportunities, links to customer requirements, and intensity of the competition to determine the best business strategy for a consolidated operation.  Offerors should also look at the strategic business/ technological opportunities and threats.

<DESC>The Applied Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Science, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the School of Public Health, University of California at Los Angeles, a contract for a twenty-month base period and 4 options for renewal to conduct a state-wide health interview survey in California, called the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer in the population of the United States because it will enable better estimates of health related behaviors and cancer risk factors for small racial-ethnic minority populations.  NCI anticipates conducting comparative analyses with the CHIS and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data.  California, the most populous state in the nation, is also the most racially and ethnically diverse.  One-third of Asians living in the US are resident in California and California has the largest urban Indian population of any state in the US.  Due to the rich diversity of the California population, data will be collected on a randomly drawn sample and it will not be necessary to over-sample to obtain detailed information on specific populations and/or health topics.  Specific populations of interest include Asians, Native Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders and Africian Americans.  With these CHIS data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer risk factors and screening among racial-ethnic minority populations.  Analyses will provide county-level and ethnnic group-specific information on cancer prevention and control behaviors and health services utilization, and will examine factors responsible for underutilization of preventive services.  The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set fort in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted

ABSTRACT:

The Airbase Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Tyndall AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of advanced technologies that develop chemical reactor systems.  These reactor systems are intended to (1) produce, or deliver, weapon system specific chemicals in combat quantities, under deployed force conditions, (2) convert waste chemicals and materials from combat weapon system maintenance and sustainment operations to benign compounds, or (3) efficiently produce thermal, mechanical or electrical energy on demand using new high-energy chemistry and reactor systems.  In addition, reactor systems are desired that (1) utilize compact unit operations (2) are compatible with force deployment constraints, (3) recover waste energy for redistribution, and/or (4) recover water for reuse.  Systems developed under this effort must be capable of being easily integrated with existing deployed base utility systems and concepts while anticipating the requirements of the AF Expeditionary Aerospace Force doctrine for the future.

Proposals should describe scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas.

This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts:
PART I - Research Interests
PART II - Proposal Preparation
PART III - Proposal Evaluation
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals. 

PART I
RESEARCH INTERESTS

A.  INTRODUCTION
This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Airbase Technology Division (AFRL/MLQ) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984   For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AFRL/MLQ contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Deployed Base Infrastructure, and Force Protection.  This BAA is intended to cover technology associated with the sustainment and logistics support of advanced weapons.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MLQ should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/MLQ technical person identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MLQ may have in a specific research project.

Prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are to submit white paper on their proposed research topic not to exceed three (3) pages in length.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms Kim Jones, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Invited proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open.

A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate.  We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.  Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources.  While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), or Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  The division goal is to award thirty percent (30%) of the contracts to Small Businesses, ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, over the life of this BAA.  For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source.

B.  MISSION

The mission of the Airbase Technology Division is to conduct research and engineering development that results in the demonstration of high-risk, high-payoff technology needed to meet the current and future requirements. Long-term technology development is needed to produce lighter, more rapid bare-base deployment; a more secure and protected force structure; and rapid, effective deployment of advanced Air Force weapon systems.  Technological advances in these key areas will ensure sustained global superiority of the Air Force for the foreseeable future through improved Air Force and Joint Operations readiness, rapid exploitation and utilization of the space mission, the successful deployment of advanced, complex weapons, and more effective peace-time training.

PART III
PROPOSAL EVALUATION

A.	Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.
1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MLQ mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this Division’s overall research program.
2.  The offeror’s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds.
B.	Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MLQ technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review.
C.	It is the policy of AFRL/MLQ to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation within the Government.  The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.
D.	Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MLQ program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

<DESC>The Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Program Office of the Space Superiority Materiel Wing, Space and Missile Systems Center is seeking interested parties capable to conduct studies, capability analyses, and develop solutions which bring together enabling technologies and system concepts for possible use in a future RAIDRS system of systems.  Small Businesses with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate. The Small Business size standard is NAICS 541710. RAIDRS is a Defensive Counterspace System with requirements to identify, characterize, and geolocate attacks on US space systems. The RAIDRS program has defined the first spiral of systems development and is looking to define the architecture and possible technologies for the future RAIDRS System, to follow Spiral 1. The goal of RAIDRS is to provide an attack detection capability for all US owned and used space assets, differentiate detections from natural/unintentional events, and reporting these attacks up to decision makers while allowing timely employment of defensive responses to threatening situations.  For many systems, this can be accomplished utilizing or leveraging existing technologies, data, sensors, and commercial or non-developmental capabilities.  In the case of future satellites and systems, RAIDRS will help define Protection/Detection requirements and interfaces.  For existing systems too far along to change design, RAIDRS will determine where shortfalls exist and help develop sensors, technologies, or algorithms to provide attack identification, characterization, and geolocation information.  RAIDRS Spiral 1 (a separate acquisition) will use commercial technologies and leverage information to accomplish a subset of the total RAIDRS requirements.  RAIDRS Spiral 2 will build on the yet to be fielded Spiral 1 architecture, system coverage, and capability.  In order to reduce risk on RAIDRS Spiral 2 and beyond, the Air Force needs to define possible system architectures to include interfaces, equipment, databases, required technology development, and decision support tools/fusion concepts. Interested companies capable of participating in RAIDRS Spiral 2 studies/development are requested to review the attached Statement of Objectives and submit any feedback, no later than 4:00 p.m. PDT, 6 October 2004 to Captain Amy Esparza via electronic mail at amy.esparza1@losangeles.af.mil.  Respondents should also include the following information: business size, GSA contract and interest in RAIDRS Spiral 2. All related communications that contain proprietary information shall be marked as such. Non-response does not prohibit participation in the upcoming Spiral 2 Studies RFP release. The government will make available additional technical material upon request, including the RAIDRS Concept of Operations (CONOPS), the RAIDRS Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), and the Spiral 1 Enabling Concept.  The government intends continued pre-solicitation activities via request for proposal (RFP) through the Federal Business Opportunities or via GSA E-buy/GSA Advantage with intent of a solicitation release in mid October 2004 and potential multiple contract award in late November 2004.  Upon eventual solicitation release, a 30-day response time for proposal submittal is anticipated. The goal for this future solicitation will be a competitive award without discussions.  The government may make up to 4 awards. To achieve this, the government is actively engaging the contractor community to ensure thorough understanding of the requirements and objectives.  This announcement does not constitute a solicitation or commitment of future contract award.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD intends to negotiate a follow-on SOLE SOURCE procurement with Environmental Monitor Service (EMS).  The contractor will provide services to install an opacity DAS that will properly interface with the two existing opacity monitors (manufactured by Environmental Monitor Service, Inc.) and to provide startup, training, and EPA-approved maintenance and audits.   The Clean Air Act required Fort Detrick to install co ntinuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS) on new boilers.  EMS is EPA-certified to manufacture, install, calibrate, audit and maintain this equipment.  EMS DAS is a propriety system that uses EMS monitoring parameters.  Only EMS product will provide th e required interface with the COMS.  EMS factory-trained service engineers are qualified both to audit and maintain the COMS and to program the monitoring parameters into the DAS.  Competitive bidding would result in significant, project delays, would requ ire duplication of cost to the government, and would not result in cost savings.  This is SOLE SOURCE procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, statements of capability to fulfill this requirement  received from other responsible businesses prior to close of business on 27 September 2004 will be evaluated.  Offerors responding to this notice must provide a statement of capability to the Contract Specialist. Please contact the Contract Specialist at 301-619-7434 or email: Kathy.Guertin@det.amedd.army.mil

The System Requirements for the quantity of one (1) each are as follows:

The system to be purchased is a Linux based visual imaging workstation, which includes dual 2.4 GHz Opteron CPUs with 4 GB main memory, a PCI Express bus integrated with the NVidia FX3400 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and 256 MB graphics memory, plus an ORAD VR-X video compositor card, 73 GB hot swap system disk, four 146 GB SCSI 320 RAID 0 disk array, DVD-RW drive, 3.5” floppy, Real-Time Clock & Interrupt Module, Gigabit Ethernet port, serial ports, USB ports, keyboard/mouse, parallel port, video port, Linux Real-Time Operating System modifications to a standard Red Hat Linux distribution, with hardware and software documentation.  Special system support software requirements include the following integrated tool capabilities:

Non-intrusive GUI-based, real-time Linux software tools which include an event analyzer, source-level debugger, frequency-based scheduler, data probe monitoring and software API, with user documentation for all software

System integration support is required as a part of the acquisition, which provides for factory or field integration and test of all hardware and software components as a complete system, including successful execution of all applicable hardware diagnostics, device drivers, and factory test procedures.  On-site maintenance and software support for the system is required for a minimum of one year as a part of this acquisition, including any system software upgrades during the period of coverage.

There are four features associated with this system acquisition which, in combination, provide a unique system configuration to satisfy the requirements for integration with the SCW Digital Video Integrated TSPI System (DVITS), for processing and display of high-speed, high-resolution digital video data at real-time data rates and the ability to generate CAD model projections with frame-buffer read back and compositing operations for overlay of projected CAD model images with Z buffer scene composition with sequential input digital video image frames.  These uniquely combined features include the following:

·	Real-time Linux operating system.  Standard commercially available distributions of the Linux Operating System do not include all the features required for successful real-time system operation.  The requirement for this acquisition is that a standard Linux distribution (Red Hat O/S, for compatibility with existing DVITS software architecture) be modified and compiled with the addition of software patches to support real-time system operation which provides the following features:

o	Shielded CPU real-time approach for dual CPU implementation, keep end-to-end latency in milliseconds time range
o	Interface with real-time clock and interrupt module which accommodates real-time interrupts in sub-millisecond time range
o	Deterministic support of scheduled real-time tasks, including graphics and image processing tasks with multiple threading applications
o	Debug real-time software tools which provide a system level view, including inter-task communications and intra-process operations (including APIs for application program interfaces)

·	PCI Express bus with PCI Express graphics processor unit (GPU).   PCI Express bus interface with the high-end GPU must support x16 PCI Express data throughput option, 128-bit IEEE floating-point precision graphics pipeline, with 128-bit color, 32-bit floating point frame buffer, 28.8 GB/sec memory bandwidth for minimum of 256 MB graphics memory, up to 2048 x 1536 pixels for dual screen display or 3840 x 2400 pixels for single screen display, 12-bit subpixel sampling precision and support for high dynamic range imaging, greater than 1 GB/sec image buffer frame read back capability, dual Digital Video Interface (DVI) output for digital display and video compositor card input (1600 x 1200 resolution at 24 Hz rate for dual DVI outputs or 3840 x 2400 resolution at 24 Hz rate for single DVI output), next generation shading architecture (OpenGL 1.5 graphics standard compatibility).  Graphics interface must be fully programmable, providing optimized compilers for Cg and OpenGL shading language standards, with complete XFree 86 X-windows device drivers for the Linux operating system installed.

·	Dual AMD Opteron 2.4 GHz 64-bit processors and HyperTransport bus.  The AMD Opteron CPU supports both 32-bit and 64-bit CPU operations in native mode, at a peak computation rate of over 4 Gflops per CPU.  The HyperTransport system bus supports a peak aggregate bandwidth of 12.8 GB/sec and is compatible with I/O interface requirements for up to 10-Gb Ethernet ports for external data I/O as well as the multiple dual-port Gigabit Ethernet ports required for interface with the new DVITS high-speed data storage server, the Hewlett-Packard Scalable File Server (HP-SFS), based on the HPC-developed Lustre file server protocol.  These high-speed computation and data transfer rates are required by DVITS to support processing requirements for high-speed, high-resolution digital video.


·	Video Compositor cards for compositing operations on dual DVI outputs from up to two GPUs per card.   The ORAD VR-X video compositing card is based on a new technology using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for combining the DVI outputs from two GPUs (normally used only as the inputs for LCD screen displays, but used by this card as true digital data input sources).  This compositing capability allows the user to decompose and share the graphics-processing task among multiple GPUs, combining the inputs of two GPUs  (or one GPU and another video compositing card output) into a separate video compositing card for the generation of a single composite video output.  The dual DVI inputs can be combined under external software program control (with software APIs provide for the video compositor card control) and selecting among the following video compositing options:

o	Frame buffer source selection and synchronization control
o	Image compositing using any of the following:
§	Sample division (for anti-aliasing)
§	Time division
§	Image division
§	Eye division
§	Scene division
§	Volume division
§	Video-on-texture capability (for input scene images)
o	DVI output chaining/linking control
o	Support for dual DVI inputs up to 2048 x 1536 pixels @ 60 Hz frame rates

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 (June 2004).  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (AR&SC) intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Field Operation Center services.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The period of performance shall be for one base year plus three option years.  

1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  The US Coast Guard (USCG) has been and continues to perform substantial depot-level repairs to their fleet of HH-60J aircraft at the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center (ARSC) HH60-J Product line, Elizabeth City, NC.  The USCG presently employs the use of ARSC technicians and Sikorsky artisans to perform these tasks.  The Sikorsky artisans are employed temporarily using task orders against a Sikorsky Sustaining Engineering contract.  As a result, the Coast Guard incurs travel and per diem costs associated with maintaining the team onsite.  In order to maintain present operational requirements, the USCG has requested a permanent twelve-man (12) team to supplement ARSC technicians performing depot level airframe repair tasks.  This will a) stabilize the augmented Sikorsky workforce onsite, and b) reduce overall costs to the Coast Guard while obtaining the same service level.

2.0.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary tools and labor to operate a depot level support team whose specialties shall include the repair and replacement of HH-60J major and minor airframe components, to include but not limited to, Main Transmission Beams, LH and RH Main Landing gear fittings, Tailcone and Tail Pylon bulkhead fittings, and all other airframe repairs directed by ARSC management.  Local ARSC Product Line Management and or their designees will determine the actual tasking.  All aircraft will be worked at USCG rent-free provided facilities at USCG Station Elizabeth City, NC with the exception of any off-site field repair requirement.  In that case the field team will perform in Government provided facilities that are environmentally friendly and safe and provided on a rent-free basis.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide any administrative and logistics requirements such as timekeeping, payroll, unrestricted material / shop supplies not supplied by USCG/ARSC, but required to perform the tasks.  All prerequisite removals and subsequent installation and checkout of components will be the responsibility of ARSC and or USCG personnel.  All aircraft and removed parts shall remain in the custody of ARSC and ARSC will be responsible for all aircraft logbook entries.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATION.  The ARSC repair taskings will be depot level maintenance in nature as defined by US Government Manuals H-60-CA/HA-SRM-000-400 and –100.  The Contractor shall have access to all necessary maintenance, rework and overhaul manuals, technical publications and applicable updates, performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that components are reworked/modified, calibrated and meet current specifications after task completion. 

4.0.	  SPECIFIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor shall perform depot-level
maintenance as necessary to meet current minimum functional performance specifications as required by paragraph 3.0.

4.1.  SITE ACTIVATION AND SUSTAINMENT.  The Contractor shall establish a full-time twelve-man (12) depot level maintenance team on location at ARSC, Elizabeth City, NC.  The team shall consist of eleven (11) aircraft sheetmetal technicians and 1 working team leader.  The team leader will act as a liaison between the Contractor and ARSC management personnel for all matters.  All repair tasks requirements will be directed through the team leader.

4.2.  STRUCTURAL REPAIRS.  The Contractor shall perform structural repairs and component replacement on OEM specific aircraft as directed by ARSC management via a weekly task requirement report.  The specific task description and associated required man-hours for these repairs will be annotated on the ARSC weekly task requirement.  Additional repairs found after/during the initial task repair requirement will be annotated and reported to ARSC maintenance management for disposition.  After completion of repairs, the aircraft will be reassembled by ARSC/USCG personnel. Any/all post assembly rigging/checkout requirements will be the responsibility of ARSC/USCG.

4.3.  ON-THE-JOB TRAINING:  The Contractor shall provide over-the-shoulder on-the-job training to ARSC personnel on a non-interference basis with the overall task.  This will be a non-certifiable type training and should be viewed by ARSC as familiarization of basic rework/repair procedures only.  

4.4.  TOOL CONTROL:  The Contractor shall be responsible to maintain a tool control program, which establishes policy and responsibilities for implementing, maintaining, controlling, storing, replacing, and inventorying common and special hand tools.  The tool control program shall be in compliance with ARSC Instruction 13600.1F “Aviation Tool Control Program”, 23 Apr 2004, as a minimum.  Any missing tool investigations will be provided in the biweekly report.

4.4.1.  EXPENDABLE TOOLS.  The Contractor shall be responsible for providing tools such as drill bits, abrasion wheels, wire brushes, paint brushes, gloves, etc. for their depot team when not readily available at the USCG E-City facility. 

 4.4.2.  COMMON HAND TOOLS.  The Contractor shall be responsible for providing their depot team with common hand tools in addition to all Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).

	4.5.  REPORTS:  The Contractor’s designated team leader shall provide a bi-weekly status report to ARSC management indicating such information as work in progress, completed tasks, logistics/material deficiencies, and parts requirements.  The bi-weekly status report will also be used to document any schedule delays and long lead material requirements.  
	
4.6.  HAZARDOUS MATERIAL:  The Contractor shall follow all approved procedures for the storage, inventory, use and disposal of hazardous material.  

4.7. TRAVEL:  Any depot team travel requirements for repairs in locations other than ARSC
shall be negotiated separately and assigned via individual delivery order.  All travel/perdiem/odc expenses shall be in accordance with current US Government JTR standards.

4.8.  ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT:  The Contractor shall provided administrative support to include, but not limited, to the following:
·	Routing and approval of all timecards and task man-hour tracking.
·	Management and administration of depot team payroll and Human Resources issues.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: FA4809-04-Q-0399
SEPT. 20, 2004 SITE VISIT MINUTES

SITE VISIT START: 0730	                                                         SITE VISIT END: 0830

	The following subjects and questions were discussed at the September 20, 2004 site visit at the Navy Dare Co. Bomb Range (DCBR) for synopsis/solicitation FA4809-04-Q-0399, Dare Co. Wetland Restoration Magnolia/Spring Roads:

1)	Mr. Doug Back of USAF DCBR Forestry began the site visit explaining the roadbed area and elevation.

a)	Mr. Back stated that the roadbed elevation on both Magnolia and Spring roads grades down from 3’ above the canal water level to the canal water level itself.

2)	Mr. Back stated that all vegetation on the right side of the roadbed must be pushed into the canal to match the roadbed level to the level of the canal on the right-hand side.

3)	Mr. Back stated that there is not enough fill dirt to totally fill the canal, so the contractor must push the brush into the canal in 100’ to 200’ segments in accordance with pg. 11 of the Statement of Work.

4)	Mr. Back stated that he will mark the left side of both Magnolia and Spring Roads with color coated flags


a)	Mr. Back stated that the orange flags will mark the sections of the “Enhancement Area” to be pushed back.
b)	Blue flags will mark the sections of the “Enhancement Area” not to be touched.
c)	Mr. Back stated that the areas are determined to remove Sweet Gum and Red Maple to make room for the new species.

5)	The question was asked as to what the contractor should do if they encounter small patches of Sweet Gum and Red Maple not in flagged areas to be pushed down.

a)	Mr. Back answered that they should be left in place if not in designated “push down” areas of the “Enhancement Area” by the appropriate orange flags.

6)	Mr. Back stated that all brush and trees pushed down in the “Enhancement Area” may be left in place.

7)	Mr. Back also stated that Deer predation and other types of animal predation and destruction on the tree seedlings are not counted toward the 80% survival rate of seedlings as stated on pg. 5 of the Statement of Work.

8)	Mr. Back asked whether the large rusted machinery frame that is dumped in the “Enhancement Area” of Magnolia Rd. could be buried in the canal section.

a)  Johanna Arnold stated the piece of equipment shall be left in place and not moved or placed in the canal section.  Pushing in the Enhancement Area near the machinery shall be done around the equipment.

9)	Mr. Joe Lafferty, DCBR Range Manager, stated that the period of performance is still Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays as stated in the Statement of Work.  However, the contractor may coordinate times during the Monday-Friday workweek on a day-by-day basis with Mr. Lafferty.

10)	 Mr. Lafferty asked how long it would take to plant the 6,000 tree seedlings proposed 
       in the Statement of Work

a)	Contractors stated that one day should be sufficient    
      to complete the planting of all 6,000 tree seedlings.

11)	The question was asked as to whether the debris on the right side of   
       the roadbed should be moved into the canal.

a)	Mr. Back said yes, all debris from the right-hand side may be used in the canal.

12)	 The question was asked as to if the contractor would be allowed to de-water the canal 
       section.

a)	Mr. Back stated that the contractor could de-water the canal only while working and not permanently.

13)	 The contractors asked if an excavator could be used to uproot and bury the brush and 
       trees from the left-hand “Enhancement Area” side of the roadbed. 
a)	Mr. Back stated that it would be allowed.

The following minutes were taken between the hours of 0900 and 0940 while completing a site visit on Magnolia Rd. with the 3 contractors who arrived late to the site visit:

1)	Mr. Back explained that work began on both Magnolia Rd. and Spring Rd. past the blue flag markers.

2)	Mr. Back stated that he would provide dimensions on how far to push back brush marked in the “Enhancement Area”.

3)	The contractors asked what was to be done with the water that is in the canal sections to be filled when the contractor fills the 100’ to 200’ sections.
a) Mr. Back stated that the water will either stay and move naturally or be de-     
                  watered for this project only and not permanently by the contractor.

4)	Mr. Back stated that the roadbed will be pushed into the canal sections from the point where the roadbed meets normal elevation on the left side “Enhancement Area” all the way into the right side canal.

5)	Mr. Back stated that the tree seedlings may be 1yr. old seedlings.

6)	Mr. Back stated that herbicide is not permitted.

7)	Mr. Back suggested that the contractor start from the backside of the roadbed on both Magnolia and Spring Roads and move forward towards the road entrances.

8)	Mr. Back stated that there will be a one-time pre-job meeting with the awarded contractor prior to the actual project performance.

The following statement was received by Mr. Doug Back on September 20, 2004 following the Dare Co. site visit:


            The segments of the enhancement areas (east side) to be pushed or reserved have been flagged as we discussed at the site visit.  The totals for each road are as follows:

Magnolia           Push 3823 feet              Reserve 1926 feet          Total 5749 feet

Spring               Push 2356 feet              Reserve 3439 feet          Total 5795 feet

Total                 Push 6179 feet              Reserve 5365 feet          Total 11,544 feet
 
            Areas between 2 orange flags are to be pushed.
            Areas between 2 blue flags are to be reserved.
 
            The large piece of discarded equipment we saw is located on the east side of Magnolia Road approximately 612 feet south of the Air Force/Wildlife Refuge property line.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure a Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance, with Calibration and Training, for the United States Naval Academy.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) N00140-04-Q-4205 contemplates a firm fixed price contract.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions, which may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.arnet.gov/far and www.dtic.mil/dfars.  The NAICS code is 423490.   It is requested that qualified sources submit a quote for the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs): CLIN 0001: 1 (each) Six Component Wind Tunnel Under Floor Force Balance; CLIN 0002: 1 (lot) Calibration and Training; CLIN 0003: 1 (each) - Shipping.

The Specifications are as follows: The proposed balance shall be of an external configuration design, with six-component measurement capabilities: 3 orthogonal forces (normal, axial, and side forces) and 3 orthogonal moments (rolling, pitching, and yawing moments). The balance/system provided by the supplier must meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the Request for Quotation, meet or exceed all conditions and specifications stated in the suppliers documentation and perform all functions stated in the supplier's documentation in a satisfactory manner.  The proposed balance shall resolve six load components.  The ranges for the static design loads of the proposed balance are defined as follows: Normal Force (lift) -  Load Magnitude Range: 600 +/- 50 lbs, Load Offset: -600/+0 lbs; Axial Force (drag)- Load Magnitude Range: 200 +/- 20 lbs, Load Offset: -200/+0 lbs, Side Force: 600 +/- 50 lbs, Load Offset:  +/- 600 lbs; Rolling Moment- Magnitude Range: 250 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset:+/- 250 ft-lbs; Pitching Moment- Magnitude Range: 180 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: +/- 180 ft-lbs; Yawing Moment - 130 +/- 20 ft-lbs, Load Offset: +/- 130 ft-lbs. These ranges are based on prior wind tunnel tests and planned future capabilities.  The proposed balance shall have the capability to easily offset the applied loads with no degradation in performance. These offset loads are to be included within the positive and negative design load ranges as designated above. The external balance and all associated equipment shall possess a minimum factor of safety in design loading of 2.5.  All calibrated forces and moments shall be resolved about the Moment Reference Center (MRC).  The MRC of the external balance shall maintain a spherical tolerance of 1/32 inch diameter or less during all wind tunnel operations (wind on). This tolerance includes (but is not limited to) model loading and motion as defined herein. The MRC of the proposed external balance shall be aligned vertically along the turntable axis of rotation of the Wind Tunnel Test Section (21 inches above the turntable). This position shall be within a tolerance which prevents fouling between the balance metric and non-metric components.  The MRC of the proposed external balance shall coincide axially with the test section midplane (52 inches – 57 inches downstream of the test section inlet plane) within +/- 1/32 inch.  Balance system accuracy (defined as the accuracy of the complete balance system - including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) must meet standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) located in the United States. The Quoter, as part of his quote submission, shall indicate balance system accuracy. It is desired that the balance system be accurate to within +/- 0.01% of full-scale load or moment including hysteresis, non-linearity, and repeatability. The accuracy required is at the final point of the measurement chain (i.e., computer screen) and, hence, includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.).  Balance system resolution is to be defined as the minimum measurable load or moment that the external balance system (including but not limited to balance frames, load cells, signal conditioning equipment, data acquisition system, etc.) shall indicate. The minimum system resolution for each component of the balance system is as follows: Normal Force (lift) - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Axial Force (drag)- Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.005%; Side Force - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.060 lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Rolling Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.025 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.010%; Pitching Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.015 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%; Yawing Moment - Maximum Component Resolution: 0.010 ft-lbs, Percent Full Scale: 0.008%.  Repeatability: The external balance system shall be able to repeat identical loading conditions to within the requirements listed in this document at long and short durations. The Quoter shall specify in his quote the intervals for checking repeatability of the balance system. The repeatability required is at the final point of the measurement chain and includes all balance system components (e.g., load cells, connections, signal conditioning, computer interface, etc.). Interactions - To simplify balance operations, checks, and calibrations, Quoter shall ensure that interactions between the balance components will be well defined and will behave as linearly as possible. The balance shall be a six component design with a maximum interaction into any one component by all other components for any given loading not to exceed two (2.0) percent of the full scale range.  Load Cells - Load transducers shall resolve to at least 1 part in 8000 with a total repeatability and hysteresis of 0.005 percent of full scale or better.  It is desired that the balance load cells be compatible with the existing wind tunnel data acquisition system (Agilent E8408A VXI Mainframe/VXI Technology VT1419A).  Load cells with analog or digital output per current IEEE standards are satisfactory as long as overall balance requirements are satisfied. Proprietary or vendor-specific interfaces are not acceptable. The load cells shall require certificates of conformance for span and zero temperature compensation at the time of acceptance. Quoter shall specify the proposed maintenance and calibration schedule for load cells.  The load cells shall have a maximum combined static error band consisting of hysteresis, non-linearity, and repeatability that satisfy all balance system requirements.  The balance shall have a simple and quick load cell swap-out capability to be used to replace failed or out-of-calibration load cells. Load cell swap-out shall not affect the calibration in effect at the time of the change.  Load cell electrical outputs must be properly shielded, grounded, and insulated to assure overall balance measurement accuracy.  Load cells shall utilize standard connectors (IEEE) and interfaces. Proprietary and/or custom connectors or interfaces shall not be used.  Load cells shall have a self-calibration feature to enable the tunnel staff to determine faults in the load cell with relative ease.  Quoter shall, in his quote, propose and estimate cost of one complete set of spare load cells to be stored on-site during normal operations.  Balance Installation - The balance shall be fastened to the laboratory floor beneath the wind tunnel test section.  The balance must be capable of being removed, if necessary, for off-site maintenance and calibration. The installation shall be positioned on a solid, elevated pier of height 30 +/- 6 inches to minimize or prevent future flood damage.  The balance must be enclosed within the space available below the test section of the wind tunnel. This space is approximately 60 inches x 96 inches x 39 +/- 6 inches high. The balance turntable mechanism shall be mounted flush with the floor of the test section. The mechanism shall be located below the test section with provision for a removable floor fairing that will minimize airflow from interfering with the turntable or the force/moment measurements.  The balance space shall have a provision for being sealed off from the surrounding room, to prevent airflow around the balance components and into the test section. Deflections between the metric and non-metric components of the balance shall be less than 1/32 inch in any axis of travel.  Quoter shall ensure in his quote that all flexures, load cells, and other critical components of the balance that require periodic inspection or maintenance shall be easily accessed and maintained without altering the calibration of the balance.  Model Support - The balance shall be capable of supporting a model in the center of the test section using one-, two-, or three-strut configurations to accommodate a variety of models. The two-strut spacing shall be variable over the (30 inches) diameter of the turntable.  The balance shall be capable of supporting a half-model or a semi-span wing mounted to the balance turntable.  The balance shall be capable of supporting a half-model or a semi-span wing mounted flush with the Academy's boundary layer splitter plate that is installed at a variable distance above the balance turntable.  The external balance and associated system components should be adaptable to many model mounting hardware configurations. Interface with Data Acquisition Instrumentation - The proposed balance and all associated system components shall interface (electronically) with the existing data acquisition system and meet the stated requirements of this document. The existing data acquisition system is compatible with the HPIB (IEEE 488.1) bus and follows IEEE standard 488-1978 'Digital interface for programmable instruments which is also published as ANSI Standard MC1.1' and also comply with IEC Publication 625.1.  The Quoter agrees to use only standard electrical connectors and associated components (such as IEEE standard interface connectors, wires, etc.) to ensure that the system retains the capability to interface potential future data acquisition technologies. No proprietary or company-specific custom components shall be used to connect the balance to other parts of the system. Environmental Conditions - The external balance including all system components shall be designed to perform to the stated requirements of this document within the laboratory temperature range of 55 Degrees F to 95 Degrees F or ensure that all requirements of this document are met under Quoter’s quote. The external balance including all system components shall be designed to perform to the stated requirements of this document within the laboratory relative humidity range of 50% to 80% or ensure that all requirements of this document are met under Quoter’s quote.  All external balance and associated system components shall be properly finished with paint or other conditioning that will protect it against environmental effects.  Model Motion - The external balance shall have the ability to remotely and automatically position the wind tunnel model during testing to the requirements specified below, using existing and new model mounting hardware.  Turntable- The proposed balance must interface and operate properly with a 30 inches diameter, 1/2 inch – 1 inch thick turntable and associated systems.  Rotation- The external balance shall have the ability to rotate a model around a vertical axis of rotation (yaw).  Model yaw angle shall be continuously variable up to +/- 150 degrees (minimum range) with an accuracy of at least 0.05 degrees and a resolution of at least 0.02 degrees.  A variable-speed mechanism shall rotate the model at a rate between 0.5 and 2 degrees per second.  The model yaw mechanism shall be actuated by a stepper or servo motor. The angle shall be positioned both directly via a user-operated switch and remotely through software.  The model position shall be indicated by an LED panel meter that has at least 3 1/2 digits of accuracy. The meter shall display the yaw angle in degrees.  Pitch- The external balance shall have the ability to rotate a model around a horizontal axis of rotation transverse to the axis of the test section (pitch).  Model pitch angle shall be continuously variable up to +/- 35 degrees (minimum range) with an accuracy of at least 0.05 degrees and a resolution of at least 0.02 degrees.  A variable-speed mechanism shall rotate the model at a rate between 0.5 and 2 degrees per second.  The model pitch mechanism shall be actuated by a stepper or servo motor. The angle shall be positioned both directly via a user-operated switch and remotely through software.  The model position shall be indicated by an LED panel meter that has at least 3 1/2 digits of accuracy. The meter shall display the pitch angle in degrees. Calibration - Besides quick proof-loadings, the external balance shall have the ability to be fully calibrated to established standards a minimum of once per year with reasonable and minimal effort, as installed at the Academy. The Quoter shall indicate in his quote how he intends to design and build an adequate calibration fixture for the external balance. Full Calibration- The Quoter shall agree to provide documentation that the balance is properly calibrated and meets the Academy specifications as outlined in this document.
