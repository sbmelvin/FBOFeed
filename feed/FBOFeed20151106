Current qualified sources are:  Boeing (Cage: 43999), Thomas Instruments Inc. (Cage: 5h860), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources solicited may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered. It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Data package will be provided. Qualification Requirements: Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. EXPORT CONTROL ITEMS: Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Program Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capabilities, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified sources require acquisition of the part from the approved sources.

All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  The Government will not hold up award pending qualification.
The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8421.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-16-32046, N0038315MO07022 BASIC, of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) intends to award multiple commercial, indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for vaccines and vaccine combinations effective against Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5 clade 2.3.4.4 (EA H5) in order to establish an emergency vaccine stockpile.
<p>The APHIS National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) is the nation's repository of critical veterinary supplies, equipment, and service resources. It exists because of the nation's concern over animal diseases of catastrophic proportions that would<br />&bull; deplete State and local response inventories, <br />&bull; generate surge requirements that would overwhelm commercial sources, and<br />&bull; prevent unaffected States from providing significant help for fear of the threat crossing their borders.</p>
<p>NVS's ability to deploy within 24 hours large amounts of critical veterinary resources ensures states have what they need to respond to catastrophes and other outbreaks. The arrival and subsequent evolution of Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 lineage (EA H5 viruses) in North America has resulted in a catastrophic epiornitic, affecting both domestic poultry and captive avian wildlife. These viruses may persist within the wild bird compartment which could serve as a reservoir and pose a significant threat to U.S. poultry and avian collections.</p>
<p>Therefore, NVS seeks sufficient supplies of vaccine, to be used singly or in combination with other vaccines that are effective against EA H5 viruses, suitable for use in chickens and/or turkeys ranging from one-day of age up to &ge; 3 years of age. The goal is to acquire and maintain an emergency/supplementary stockpile of EA H5 vaccines available for delivery anywhere in the United States within 24 hours of order by the NVS.</p>
<p>Such products might include but not be limited to the following formulations/platforms: finished vaccine with shelf-life &ge; 1 year; vaccine precursors that can be rapidly processed into finished vaccine (e.g., antigen concentrates for inactivated vaccines) with potency retention of &ge; 2 years; and modified-live, or nonviable/nonreplicating vaccines that can be stored in a manner to ensure potency retention of &ge; 2 years. This vaccine stockpile would be used for emergency vaccination and to supplement commercial supplies as part of a larger vaccination campaign. All finished vaccines or vaccine precursors would be stored and maintained at the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Nationally, the placement rate of laying hens and meat turkeys is approximately 20 million birds per month. With each bird requiring two doses of vaccine prior to placement, 80 million doses per month will be needed just for these two sectors alone. Therefore, vaccine companies should minimally have a production capacity &ge; 100 million doses per month to address these two sectors.</p>
<p>NVS seeks a contract that will have the following components: <br />1) Production and banking of AI vaccine or vaccine precursors: Contractors would produce and store product and must demonstrate a storage capacity of a minimum of 100 million doses to a maximum of 500 million doses of vaccine or vaccine precursor that are effective against EA H5 viruses, whether used alone or as combinations of different vaccines;<br />2) Vaccine must be fully licensed, conditionally licensed, or permitted (only products permitted for general distribution and sale will be considered) in accordance with the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulations in order to be eligible for award. Delivery anywhere within the continental U.S. of up to 100 million doses of finished vaccine eligible for distribution and sale must be made within 10 calendar days of order as directed by the NVS;<br />3) Vaccine or vaccine precursor must be stored in a manner consistent with the longest potency viability of the product, and demonstrate satisfactory potency when tested at twelve (12) month intervals throughout the duration of the contract;<br />4) Small serials of finished vaccine from vaccine precursor will be produced by the manufacturer every twelve (12) months and potency tested by the manufacturer and provide potency data for review by the CVB;<br />5) Samples of finished vaccine and/or serum samples from vaccinated birds will be provided to CVB if requested by the CVB; <br />6) Product will be stored by the manufacturer in a manner that ensures the longest shelf life while retaining satisfactory potency as determined by the CVB (e.g., vaccine antigen concentrate) which shall be no less than two years;</p>
<p>The contracts will have a guaranteed minimum of $6 million worth of doses up to a maximum of 500 million doses of vaccine or vaccine precursor effective against EA H5. The North American Industry Classification System code is 325414 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation number AG-6395-S-16-0005 will be will be issued on an unrestricted basis and posted on FBO during the latter part of November, 2015. Any questions or inquiries must be e-mailed to Jim Roloff, contracting officer, at james.g.roloff@aphis.usda.gov.</p>

 Synopsis: 
Please note that this is NOT a request for quotes or proposals. The Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 3, Network Contracting Office 3 (10N3NCO) is currently conducting a market survey for firms capable of providing the following service:


STATEMENT OF WORK

Title: THYROSEQ V.2 Next Generation Sequencing Assay.

1.	INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW: 
Fine Needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a common approach to evaluate thyroid nodules. It offers definitive diagnosis of a benign or malignant nodule in the majority of the cases. However 10-25% of nodules yield one of three indeterminate cytological diagnoses leading to suboptimal management of these patients. Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) are a common indeterminate diagnosis with cancer risk ranging from 6% to 48%. Current guidelines recommend that most of these patients undergo diagnostic thyroid surgery to assess whether nodules are benign or malignant. Approximately 70% to 80% of the time, the nodules prove to be benign by surgical pathology.
The ThyroSeq v.2 multigene Next Generation sequencing (NGS) panel of molecular mutational markers conducted provides both high sensitivity and high specificity for cancer detection in thyroid nodules with AUS/FLUS cytology, which should allow improved management of these patients by avoiding many of the diagnostic surgeries currently performed for benign nodules, with associated decreases in health costs and postsurgical complications. Through ThyroSeq v.2 over 400 hotspots and fusion points on over 60 genes are tested to classify both benign and malignant nodules.
By doing a Next Generation Sequencing of gene to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant ThyroSeq v.2 we comply with VA's mission of providing exceptional care that improves the health and overall well-being of the Veteran.

1.1	Background:
The ThyoSeq v.2 FNA Analysis is a diagnostic service provided for the assessment of thyroid nodules. The ThyroSeq v.2 Next Generation sequencing combines specialized cytopathology experts from incumbent vendor who properly identifies and categorizes biopsies allowing for further testing on only truly indeterminate FNAs. Physicians submit to incumbent vendor thyroid nodule FNA samples collected in a single patient visit. The combination of cytopathology screening with reflex to molecular testing is what makes ThyroSeq V.2 the most accurate diagnosis allowing patients to avoid unneeded surgeries and receive the right surgery. 

1.2	Scope of Work
Patient samples obtained through fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies are collected for both cytopathology assessment and ThyroSeq v.2. Initially cytopathology assessment is conducted. If the cytopathology diagnosis is benign, suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic, the Cytopathology FNA Analysis is complete. If the cytopathology diagnosis is indeterminate (includes Follicular lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS)/Atypia of Undetermined significance (AUS) and (suspicious for) Hurthle/Follicular Neoplasm), the thyroid nodule is greater than or equal to 1 cm and the patient is 21 or older, The ThyroSeq v.2 Next generation gene sequencing is performed. Thyroseq v.2 measures gene mutation which classifies both benign and malignant nodules by identifying actual mutations. Over 400 hotspot genes and fusion points on over 60 genes are tested. All results will be reported by the incumbent vendor.

1.3	Objectives:
By combining specialized cytopathology and Thyroseq V.2 next generation sequencing
1.3.1	Enables physicians to identify patients who may avoid surgery
1.3.2	Empowers confident and timely clinical decisions from a single patient visit
1.3.3	Integrates seamlessly into a physician's practice workflow
1.3.4	Ensures quality and convenience in collecting and shipping patient samples
1.3.5	Allows patients to receive better care at a lower cost.

1.4	Period of Performance
This Statement of Work (SOW) is submitted for the processing Cytopathology and ThyroSeq v.2 tests for Base plus four option years.

<DESC><p><br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a non competitive, sole source basis, with Wake Forest University, entitled "The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) Suite of Studies". This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for five years.</p>
<p>The WHIMS Suite of Studies is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this contract is to continue prospective follow-ups, including adjudicated diagnostic assessments and cognitive evaluations, of women in the WHIMS-ECHO studies, to provide the scientific community with biostatistical support and infrastructure for analysis of existing and new cognitive and MRI outcomes collected through the WHIMS Suite of Studies, and to provide support for retrieval of WHI biospecimens for investigations of factors related to cognitive and brain aging.</p>
<p>The proposed extension of support for the WHIMS Suite of Studies will provide a unique opportunity to gain further insights into the antecedents of cognitive impairment and resilience in a large sample of the "oldest-old" women who have been followed for 20 years. In addition, the vast array of data and biospecimens available through the ongoing WHI studies will provide an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline, impairment, and resilience. <br /><br /><br />Wake Forest University is uniquely qualified to conduct these studies as the WHIMS study began at the University with private funding and Wake Forest has developed and maintained the cohorts and procedures in the initial assessment periods. The raw data resulting from the initial contract period of this study under private funding are owned by Wake Forest University and are not publicly available or transferable. These initial data include the information at pre-treatment baseline evaluation (before any hormone or other intervention) that are necessary to examine the earliest risk and protective factors that may be associated with cognitive impairment, including dementia, and cognitive resilience as long as 20 years later. <br /><br />It is not possible for another vendor to perform the follow-on study because the required data collected at study baseline are owned by Wake Forest University and are not transferable. In addition, Wake Forest University has permission to conduct the WHIMS study as an ancillary study to the WHI parent study and obtained informed consent from participants at the initiation of the study. Neither is transferable and a new contractor would have to submit a new request for an ancillary study to WHI and would have to reconsent participants, resulting in a 6 to 9 month delay of the study and added costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, these baseline data will be used to identify risk and protective factors for cognitive decline and impairment more than 20 years later in relation to the HT interventions administered through 2002 and 2004 for combination HT and CEE-Alone, respectively. It is not possible to repeat this study as it is no longer ethical to conduct a large scale study investigating effects of these hormonal treatments on cognition in older postmenopausal hormone therapy because the WHI studies showed that the health risks of these treatments in older women exceeded the benefits. The FDA now recommends HT use for treatment of menopausal symptoms for the shortest possible duration. Thus, the WHIMS study, including data collected under the initial private funding to Wake Forest University, provides a unique opportunity to investigate risk and protective factors on long-term cognitive outcomes within the context of a randomized clinical trial of HT.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy (HT) were designed to determine whether HT had beneficial effects on health outcomes, especially cardiovascular health, in postmenopausal women. Women without uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg (Premarin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), or a matching placebo, and women with uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either CEE, 0.625 mg, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg, (Prempro, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or a matching placebo. The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) was an ancillary study to the WHI and enrolled 7,427 women aged 65 years and older. WHIMS investigated the effects of HT on risk of probable dementia and any cognitive impairment and on changes in global cognition over time. Because WHIMS did not include detailed cognitive assessments of women without cognitive impairment, the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) was designed as an ancillary study to WHIMS to assess memory and other domain-specific cognitive functions in women free of dementia. WHISCA enrolled 2,305 WHIMS participants at 14 clinical sites on average 3 years after WHI randomization and was conducted under contract number N01-AG-9-2115. The WHI and ancillary WHIMS and WHISCA studies were stopped earlier than planned for both the combination therapy (in 2002) and CEE-Alone (in 2004) because these treatments increased health risks and did not protect against coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>Although study medications were discontinued, follow-up assessments have continued. Contrary to expectations, the WHIMS studies showed that CEE+ MPA versus placebo was associated with a significant increase in risk for probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment (Shumaker, Legault et al. 2003), poorer performance on a measure of global cognition (Rapp, Espeland et al. 2003), and greater verbal memory decline over time (Resnick, Maki et al. 2006). CEE-Alone treatment versus placebo in women with prior hysterectomy was associated with a trend toward increased dementia risk (Shumaker, Legault et al. 2004), significantly poorer performance on a measure of global cognition (Espeland, Rapp et al. 2004), but no significant effects on domain-specific cognitive change over time (Resnick, Espeland et al. 2009). <br /><br />WHIMS-MRI was conducted post-trial in approximately 1,400 WHIMS participants to determine whether potential effects of HT on cerebral ischemic disease could explain the adverse effects of HT on cognitive outcomes. Contrary to expectation, HT was not significantly associated with ischemic lesion burden on MRI (Coker, Hogan et al. 2009), but women who had been randomized to active treatment had smaller total brain, frontal and hippocampal volumes compared with women who had been randomized to placebo (Resnick, Espeland et al. 2009).</p>
<p>In 2008, WHI clinic visits ceased and WHIMS transitioned to an annual telephone-administered cognitive assessment battery (Rapp, Legault et al. 2012) for the WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (ECHO) study, which remains active and incorporates some components of the WHISCA assessment. In addition to the WHIMS-ECHO continuation, the WHIMS-Y study to test the "window of opportunity" hypothesis was initiated in 2008, using the telephone assessment protocol to evaluate cognition in WHI participants who had been randomized to HT or placebo at age 50-55 but had not previously received cognitive testing. The WHIMS-Y study tested the clinically relevant hypothesis that HT shortly after menopause would confer benefit to cognitive health later in life. The recently published initial results from WHIMS-Y showed neither harm nor benefit of early postmenopausal HT treatment on cognition more than 10 years later (Espeland, Shumaker et al. 2013).</p>
<p>The WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y studies continue through 2016 (under contract HHSN271201100004C). By the end of the current contract, data collection for WHIMS-Y will be sufficient to address the original scientific questions. It is expected that approximately 2,000 older women in WHIMS-ECHO will remain active in 2016 and that these women will have an average age of 88.2 years.<br /><br /><br />This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-15-006 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-15-006.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractors. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair, by design-build or design-bid-build, of general building construction at various government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, maintenance/repair facilities, aircraft control towers, hangars, fire stations, office buildings, laboratories, dining facilities and related structures.
 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000. Task orders will range between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.
 The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two: Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Small Business Utilization, Factor 6 - Technical Solution, Factor 7  Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 8 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).
 Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no formal pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and/or the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about October 7, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.
 Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above.  A sources sought notice was posted on April 10, 2015 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.  As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with one contract reserved for a highly qualified small business.  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

<ARCHDATE>04212016
<CONTACT>Fuchs, Samantha

<a href="mailto:Fuchs.Samantha@epamail.epa.gov">Samantha Dawson Fuchs</a>
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with the University of Michigan for the procurement of Development of Near-Field Human Health Characterization Factors for Life Cycle Assessment
Specific tasks and deliverables in this Statement of Work are as follows: 
-	Task 1: Create and Implement a Quality Assurance Project Plan
-	Task 2: Develop a list of chemical/archetype combinations which will be required to characterize significant chemical exposures and determine the chemical/archetype combinations which are expected to have the most significant near-field exposures.
-	Task 3: Survey the field and determine at least one suggested methodology to develop characterization factors for the major archetypes.
-	Task 4. Develop a model and characterization factors that are consistent with current LCA practices, including a functional unit approach.
-	Optional Task 5: Expand characterization to include professional use of selected consumer products.  
EPA has identified the University of Michigans Dr. Olivier Jolliet and the Impact and Risk Modeling Research Group (iMod Research Group) as the only known source able to satisfy the Governments requirements.  Specifically, The iMod Research Group is responsible for and/or has access to a broad array of datasets which can be directly applied or leveraged in the accomplishment of this Statement of Work and which are not publicly available. In particular, these include files underlying the USEtox model, a global, consensus-based human and ecosystem toxicity life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) model widely used in LCA modeling, and its more recently developed indoor air and near-field exposure modules. The iMod Research Group has developed and maintains the IMPACTWorld+ location-specific life cycle impact assessment method. The underlying datasets and pathways for all of these models can be used to develop ontologies for linking product use to life cycle assessment and risk assessment. In addition to these academic models, the iMod Research Group has access to relevant EPA datasets including ToxCast, ExpoCast, AcTOR and CPcat, through on-going collaborative research efforts. Inclusion of this information is necessary for connecting this research with the EPAs computational toxicology program, a cornerstone of the next-generation assessment tools. The iMod Research Group has developed a preliminary ontology to relate AcTOR and CPcat categories to an exposure modeling oriented classification valid for both risk assessment and life cycle assessment. This work will provide the necessary knowledge for the contractor to assist with the ontology development. The iMod Research Group has explored a novel approach to estimate exposure at workplaces through combining the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) exposure database containing more than 50,000 substance-industry sector observed concentrations with manual labor hours worked in each of the US manufacturing sectors.
The life cycle assessment and risk assessment research communities include a diverse set of individuals and research groups, many of whom hold data, models, and perspectives relevant for this work. 
The iMod Research Group has already built collaborative relationships with many of the project partners and stakeholders intended to engage. As a leading team in the development of toxicity methodologies for life cycle impact assessment (since 1993), Dr. Jolliet, with the support of the iMod Research Group, initiated the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative and co-developed the USEtox model as a consensus project, giving them access to a large group of teams working on human health impact assessment modeling. Finally, Dr. Jolliet is the founding member of the University of Michigan Risk Science Center and leads the Computational Risk and Exposure Modeling (CORE-MOD) initiative to develop computational models to understand the sources of adverse health impact risks associated with chemicals including direct, near field exposure of consumers and workers and far field exposures via the ambient environment. This activity provides the iMod Research Group with a unique profile within the research community and provides an intrinsic motivation consistent with the goals of the project.
The anticipated award date is December, 2015. 
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The 25 AF/NICC is seeking possible sources to provide Linguists and Analysts services (under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541930/$7.5M) in support of the United States (U.S.) Forces Operations.
<p>Subject Sources Sought is for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect charges will arise as a result of contractor submissions. The information obtained from industry responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFPs. If you are not an 8(a) Company please do not respond.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates an 8(a) competitive set-aside under the Small Business 8(a) program. Businesses are advised that FAR clause 52.219-14 -Limitations on Subcontracting will apply wherein by submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the offeror/contractor agrees that in performance of the contract at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a work force possessing the skills, knowledge and training to satisfactorily perform the services required. The Linguist and Analyst primary function shall be to furnish extensive linguistic and analytical services. The historical number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) required for this&nbsp;support has been&nbsp;approximately 160.</p>

They shall furnish the necessary management, technology, and personnel required to provide the requested Linguist/Analyst support as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide Global and Cryptologic language mission training to military forces in all the skills of linguist professional skills; develop new Global and Cryptologic training materials and curriculum where none exist.</p>
<p>The acquisition will require contractor personnel to have a final U.S. Government issued TOP SECRET security clearance and be DCID 6/4 eligible with a current Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).

For accuracy and continuity, a response to this sources sought will be considered a stand alone document.<br /><br />Any Prime Contractor candidate shall be able to provide a plan to cover ALL Linguist/Analyst Task requirements (see draft PWS).</p>
<p>Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be an 8(a) set-aside is that two or more 8(a) prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219- 14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) ... (b) by submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ".

<p><br />1. Only 8(a) small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Teaming arrangements or joint ventures are acceptable. See 13 CFR 121.103(h) for specific rules pertaining to joint ventures.</p>
<p>2. Provide documentation that supports your company's capability or a plan to meet<br />ALL of the PWS requirements. Failure to provide adequate documentation may prevent the government from being able to adequately assess your capabilities.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Program Development and Integration Directorate, Simulation and Analysis Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. This SSS does not constitute a commitment to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), or award of a contract. This issuance does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach. Wright-Patterson AFB is requesting information on Simulation and Analysis Capabilities Development and Integration Services (CDIS). This SSS is solely intended to obtain Market Research information in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation( FAR) Part 10 and its supplements to determine level of interest, and identify potential competitive sources capable of providing capabilities in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The proposed National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement action is 541712, Exception Aircraft with a size standard of 1,500 employees. The Government anticipates an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract with Firm Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursement contract line items, consisting of a five-year ordering period. The ordering period of performance is anticipated to be 1 July 2017 through 30 June 2022.

The NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM. Foreign firms are not authorized to participate. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply.<br />Responses should demonstrate capabilities and expertise by completing the attached Information Matrix and providing information in a narrative form which further demonstrates proficiency in the capabilities detailed in the Performance Work Statement. Do not include cost or pricing information. Responses shall be in 12 point font and not exceed 10 pages. No feedback or evaluations will be provided to respondents. Submit responses via e-mail to Mr. Dallas Strawsburg at Dallas.Strawsburg@us.af.mil. Responses shall be submitted no later than 12:00 p.m. NOON EST, 7 Dec 2015. No facsimile responses will be accepted. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.<br />This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes inclusion of proprietary information may be required in the response. If so, clearly mark such and present it as an addendum to non-proprietary part. No decision has yet been regarding the acquisition strategy for this requirement. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<CONTACT>Ronald K. McCall, Email ronald.k.mccall.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information on Dual Mode Semi-Active Laser (SAL) Imaging Infrared (IIR) Seeker Technologies.
<p>Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Request for Information. Any questions concerning this posting should be sent to the Contractual Point of Contact: Mr. Ron McCall, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, CCAM-RDB, Redstone Arsenal, AL via email at ronald.k.mccall.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only. No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received. Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. RFI Responses will only be accepted from United States Companies and Organizations. Foreign Participation is not authorized for this effort.<br /><br />AMRDEC is interested in obtaining US domestic sources of information to serve as a market survey to aid in programmatic planning for advanced technology development and demonstration of an affordable compact dual mode semi-active laser imaging infrared (SAL-IIR) terminal homing weapon solution. The objective of this process is to assess current capabilities within the US defense industrial base, particularly as they relate to an SAL-IIR seeker capability. As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical data describing the proposed concept and innovative methodology information to assist in programmatic planning. This information will be used to: (1) Determine the ability of current and near term emerging technology to support a SAL-IIR seeker capability; (2) Identify feasible design concept alternatives; (3) Determine the approximate/relative cost information for each proposed design concept and (4) Determine the estimated performance characteristics, goals, and/or projections associated with each proposed design concept.</p>
<p>The US Army has made considerable advances in reducing the cost per kill for small compact weapons as exhibited by the guided 2.75 inch rocket. AMRDEC is interested in technologies that will continue to extend the operational capabilities of small compact weapon systems while maintaining a level of affordability. Terminal homing semi-active laser (SAL) guidance has proven to be a low cost effective solution for small compact weapons and the soldier has come to rely on the performance attained from target designation with a laser. AMRDEC is looking to extend the operational capability of small compact weapons by adding an imaging capability to provide enhanced lethality for SAL guidance and to provide an additional mode of target engagement that does not rely on laser designation. In particular, AMRDEC is interested in technology to support the concept of a single-sensor, dual-mode SAL-IIR seeker suitable for packaging in a 2.75" form factor. Desired operational capability of the small compact weapon system is to acquire and hit stationary and moving targets via selectable mode to include: 1) SAL designation, 2) Passive designation (imaging only), or 3) Dual-mode SAL-IIR operation for enhanced SAL lethality.<br /><br />White Paper Submissions: Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper addressing the above area of interest. Submissions should focus on information concerning available, emerging, and/or required SAL-IIR seeker technologies. The white paper responses shall be written from a design solution perspective, showing how various proposed components would be integrated into a SAL-IIR seeker solution, and with consideration given to how that solution would affordably extend operational capability over single mode seeker solutions.<br /><br />The white paper should include the following: (1) A brief description of the threat/gap being addressed and a conceptual SAL-IIR seeker design, including major components; (2) An overall feasibility assessment of the conceptual SAL-IIR seeker design , including a high-level risk assessment for the conceptual SAL-IIR seeker design that articulates the respondents understanding of associated risks, and an estimate of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of major components, and the seeker system as a whole; (3) A discussion of potential Concept of Operations (CONOPS) resulting from implementation of a dual mode SAL-IIR seeker weapons concept; (4) A candidate high-level implementation roadmap that includes transition points; (5) SAL-IIR seeker cost and/or complexity drivers; (6) A brief description of any projects that the respondent's company is or has been involved in that are similar in concept to what that company is proposing for this request, including any relevant lessons learned; and (7) Any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent.<br /><br />Based on the responses, AMRDEC, solely at its discretion, may request unfunded, follow on, face-to-face briefings. Such presentation is in addition to the written response and is optional for each invited responder.<br />Only US based and owned companies are eligible to respond. Foreign participation is not authorized for this effort. <br />Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 10 pages, with one inch margins, and no smaller than 12 pt Times New Roman or Courier New font in Microsoft Word format.<br />&nbsp;<br />Responses may also include a quad chart in addition to the white paper containing any pictures or representations, prospective uses and/or applications, a technical description, purpose, payoff and any other relevant information the respondent wants to share. <br />Responses shall include only one concept per submittal, but multiple submittals are permitted.<br /><br />The Government requests that the respondents deliver one electronic soft copy via encrypted email if possible to the below POC in Microsoft Word or PDF format No Later Than (NLT) 1500 hours (CST), 15 December 2015 for each submittal. All submissions should include RFI Solicitation Number W31P4Q-16-R-0045 in the subject line of the email and the Solicitation Number and company CAGE code and DUNS number in the body of the email. Responses to this request for information may NOT be submitted via facsimile or they will be disregarded. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued if request for return receipt is included with the response. All information submitted will be adequately safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR Part 15.207. All responses must be submitted as described above.</p>
<p>E mail unclassified responses to:</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement REF0001, Rapid Equiping Force,&nbsp;Fort Belvoir, Virginia&nbsp;only and is not an intent to procure. A solicitation is not available at this time and any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.<br /><br />The government is only conducting market research and attaining information to identify contractors that are able to provide the item listed on the the attachment and the cost associated to acquire this item. All information provided is STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued for maximizing competition and should not be&nbsp;construed as limiting competition.<br /><br />This is NOT a request for quote, invitation for bids, or request for proposals. NO solicitation document is currently available. This notice does NOT constitute a commitment by the Government. The Government will NOT pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this sources sought. Any costs associated with this sources sought response submittals are solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to the RFI does not preclude participation in any future requirement.<br /><br />Background and Scope<br />The threat of UASs on Americans either within or outside of the Continental United States (CONUS) is an ongoing concern. Continued improvements to UAS technology are making the systems more available and at lower cost, with a larger payload ratio (payload weight divided by vehicle weight), and easier to fly, navigate and transport, increasing the opportunities to use the UAS in helpful or nefarious ways. This test event evaluates technologies intended to counter UASs through detection, classification, and defeat. Sources sought should be capable of:
<p>1. Detection of CLI UAS (&lt;20 lbs)<br />2. Identification of CLI UAS<br />3. Non-kinetic defeat of CLI UAS (RF and/or GPS jamming)</p>
<p>The primary focus will be on Group 1 UASs, both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and fixed wing that have a maximum weight of 20 pounds, maximum operating altitude of 1200 feet AGL, maximum speed of 100 knots, and maximum range of 10 nautical miles. They are typically hand-launched, self-contained, portable systems employed for a small unit or base security. They are capable of providing "over-the-hill" or "around-the-corner" reconnaissance and surveillance. They typically operate within visual range and are analogous to radio-controlled model airplanes. Examples of Group 1 UASs are the DJI Phantom and X-UAV Talon.</p>
<p>The REF is seeking to find existing products that can detect, identify, and defeat Group 1 UAS. The method of defeat must be non-kinetic in nature and operation. The standoff of UAS detection must be at least 800 meters. The system of detection and identification must be able to differentiate between multiple UAS, manned aircraft, and natural flora and fauna. <br />The REF will not provide funding for those responding to attend. Attendance at this event is the responsibility of those that are selected to attend. The REF will not publish results of the test to the general public or those that attend. A participant may request the release of their raw testing data, but will not be shown the raw data of other participants.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist in the selection of available counter UAS products at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) six (6) and greater ahead of an upcoming test event. TRL 6 is defined as representative model or prototype system tested in a relevant environment</p>
<p>Vendors who are able to attend a test event within the month of December 2015, and are able to perform all of the parameters set forth below, are asked to forward supporting information back to the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF).</p>
<p>Requested Information:<br />The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.

Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, so that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.</p>

	Performance Criteria	Performance Measurement	Performance
/Standard	Calculation
1	Contractor Service Response Time	The contractor repair person will respond to end user issues within SIX BUSINESS HOURS of
notification	Contractor must meet this requirement 95% of the time.	The measurement the Contractor Service Response Time is calculated by dividing the total number of calls responded to in six hours or less by the total number of calls during each month	2	Equipment Uptime

("Availability Hours")	Equipment must be fully operational during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are equal to the total number of working days per month times 8 hours for each shift.	Equipment must be fully operational at least   95% of the time during available hours	The measurement for Equipment Uptime is calculated by dividing the (Availability Hours- Equipment Downtime) by the Availability Hours.


Example:  One shift for the month of March with no holidays would be calculated as 8 hours x 21 days = 168 hours.


EXAMPLE:
Equipment Downtime = Response Time + Repair Time.

Total Service Response Time:  6 hours Machine Repair Time:  1 hour

Equipment Downtime = (6+1) = 7

Availability Hours (21 x 8)
= 168 hours



Equipment Uptime would be (168-7)/168 = 95%
2	Equipment Uptime

("Availability Hours")	Equipment must be fully operational during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are equal to the total number of working days per month times 8 hours for each shift.	Equipment must be fully operational at least   95% of the time during available hours	The measurement for Equipment Uptime is calculated by dividing the (Availability Hours- Equipment Downtime) by the Availability Hours.


Example:  One shift for the month of March with no holidays would be calculated as 8 hours x 21 days = 168 hours.


EXAMPLE:
Equipment Downtime = Response Time + Repair Time.

Total Service Response Time:  6 hours Machine Repair Time:  1 hour

Equipment Downtime = (6+1) = 7

Availability Hours (21 x 8)
= 168 hours

Equipment Uptime would be (168-7)/168 = 95%

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing one automated loadlock, two throttle valves and control software upgrades for two existing Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tools to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The sputtering tools are sited and used in the CNST NanoFab as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the automated loadlock, throttle valves and software that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>The NIST CNST NanoFab operates two Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tool to deposit thin films of various metals and insulators, designated by their serial numbers 49064 and 43814.<br /><br />a. S/N 49064.<br /><br />In its present condition, each user must spend an average of 60 minutes to perform one sputtering run. Of these 60 minutes, 45 are required to pump the chamber down from atmospheric pressure to the required 4 x 10-4 Pa (3 x 10-6 Torr) after loading the wafer. These 45 minutes can be reduced to 10 minutes by upgrading the tool with an automated loading chamber ("loadlock") system allowing the main chamber to remain under high vacuum during sample insertions, thus reducing the total run time from 60 to 25 minutes. The upgrade shall enable the operator to load a wafer without breaking the vacuum in the sputter tool chamber, and through software control automatically evacuate the loadlock, open an intra-chamber gate valve, transfer the wafer to the sputter tool, retract the loadlock manipulator, close the gate valve, and commence a pre-programmed sputter deposition process. After the process is completed, the loadlock system shall automatically return the wafer to the loadlock for removal by the user. This upgrade will more than double the throughput of this tool and thereby increase both productivity and customer satisfaction.<br />The throttle valve (sometimes referred to as "control gate valve") upgrade will provide control of the process pressure independently from the gas flows (argon, nitrogen and oxygen) which will give researchers the means of adjusting the stress in the deposited films. Presently, the sputter tool is equipped with a simple open/closed valve which does not offer such flexibility.<br /><br />b. S/N 43814<br /><br />This system needs to be upgraded with a throttle valve (sometimes referred to as "control gate valve") which will provide control of the process pressure independently from the gas flows (argon, nitrogen and oxygen) and will give researchers the means of adjusting the stress in the deposited films. Presently, this sputter tool is equipped with a simple open/closed valve which does not offer such flexibility.<br />This instrument also needs a software upgrade of its control system. Presently, operation of the tool is done via a touch screen allowing only deposition of one material layer at a time. The upgrade shall be substantially similar as the software already installed on S/N 49064, allowing complete automatic deposition of multilayer films, including operation of the new throttle valve.<br />This will enable redundancy between the two tools and allow users to operate either tool interchangeably.</p>
<p>1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION: S/N 49064<br /><br />a. The loadlock system and throttle valve shall upgrade a Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tool.<br />b. In order to accommodate the loadlock, a circular hole of diameter approximately 200 mm needs to be opened in the side of the sputtering chamber and a mating flange welded in place.<br />c. The loadlock shall be equipped with a motorized manipulator arm to transfer a wafer placed on a carrier plate into and out of the sputtering chamber.<br />d. The transfer sequences and sputter deposition process shall be completely automatic and consist of the following steps: pump down the loadlock to a suitable transfer pressure; open the gate valve; transfer the wafer carrier plate into the sputter chamber using a motorized manipulator; retract the loadlock manipulator; close the gate valve; pump down the sputter chamber to its base pressure; run the sputter deposition process; open the gate valve, transfer the carrier plate back into the loadlock; close the gate valve; and vent the loadlock to atmospheric pressure.<br />e. The loadlock and transfer mechanism shall be compatible with the existing sputtering tool features, including wafer heating to 400 &#8304;C, carrier plate rotation, and wafer RF bias.<br />f. The throttle valve shall have an inside diameter of 6 inches.</p>
<p>2. CONSTRUCTION: S/N 49064<br /><br />a. The loadlock chamber shall be made of electro-polished 304L-series stainless steel.<br />b. The throttle valve shall be made of electro-polished 304-series or 316-series stainless steel.</p>
<p>3. WAFER TRANSFER: S/N 49064<br /><br />a. The loadlock shall be capable of accepting and transferring one wafer at a time, with wafer diameters of 75 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm. Wafers shall be transferred by means of a carrier plate fitting the existing rotating platform in the sputter chamber.</p>
<p>4. PUMPING SYSTEM: S/N 49064<br /><br />a. The loadlock chamber shall be capable of reaching a vacuum of 6.6 Pa (5 x10-2 Torr) in &le; 5 minutes.<br />b. The loadlock may make use of the existing pumps on the sputter system.<br />c. The loadlock shall be equipped with the following:<br />i. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic high vacuum gate valve between the loadlock chamber and the sputter chamber;<br />ii. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic roughing valve to the loadlock chamber;<br />iii. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic vent valve;<br />iv. Vacuum gauge on the loadlock chamber interfaced to the sputter tool system controller; and<br />v. A quick-access-type loadlock door with viewport (minimum diameter 50 mm).<br />d. The throttle valve shall be capable of regulating the chamber pressure from 0.013 Pa (0.1 mTorr) to 13 Pa (100 mTorr).</p>
<p>5. SOFTWARE: S/N 49064<br /><br />a. The loadlock software shall integrate seamlessly with the existing sputtering tool software and the programmable logic controller.<br />b. The software shall be capable of an automated, unattended process sequence as described in section 1.d above from wafer-in to wafer-out.<br />c. The software shall provide the following options:<br />i. Manual operation of loadlock and sputter tool;<br />ii. Automatic operation of loadlock and sputter tool: auto-pump, auto-vent and auto-deposition;<br />iii. Operation of the sputter tool without use of the loadlock; <br />iv. Abort button to stop any process step.<br />d. The throttle valve controller shall integrate seamlessly with the existing sputtering tool software and the programmable logic controller.</p>
<p>6. SOFTWARE: S/N 43814<br /><br />a. The software shall be capable of an automated, unattended process sequence as described in section 1.d above from wafer-in to wafer-out.<br />b. The software shall be substantially the same as installed in S/N 49064.<br />c. The software shall provide the following options:<br />i. Manual operation of loadlock and sputter tool;<br />ii. Automatic operation of loadlock and sputter tool: auto-pump, auto-vent and auto-deposition;<br />iii. Operation of the sputter tool without use of the loadlock;<br />iv. Abort button to stop any process step.</p>
<p><br />7. THROTTLE VALVE: S/N 43814<br /><br />a. The throttle valve shall have an inside diameter of 8 inches.<br />b. The throttle valve shall be made of electro-polished 304-series or 316-series stainless steel.<br />c. The throttle valve shall be capable of regulating the chamber pressure from 0.013 Pa (0.1 mTorr) to 13 Pa (100 mTorr).<br />d. The throttle valve shall be integrated into the new control software.</p>

Links from PubMed, Web of Science&reg;, and the NIH Library website allow NIH staff to connect directly to the articles on the Springer website following a search of the various sites. Springer online resources allow DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators.

<DESC>Veterans Health Affairs, Network Contracting Office 4, is issuing this request for information/sources sought notice in order to identify homeless shelters/facilities in the city of Philadelphia, PA that can provide services for homeless Veterans, including those with serious mental illness and substance use disorders. 
General scope: the services will be provided for authorized Veterans within the catchment area of the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC).  PVAMC requires two separately located programs that provide two distinct types of services:
Low Demand Safe Haven (LDSH): LDSH are 24-hour staffed transitional residences with private or semi-private accommodations that target the population of hard-to-reach, chronically homeless Veterans with mental illness and/or substance use problems who require a low-demand environment. The low-demand or non-intrusive environment is designed to re-establish trust and motivate the homeless Veteran to seek needed treatment services and transitional and permanent housing options. Lengths of stay in LDSH programs are typically 6 months with the option to extend based on clinical need. 
Contracted Emergency Residential Services (CERS): CERS programs target and prioritize homeless Veterans transitioning from literal street homelessness, Veterans being discharged from institutions, including those in need of medical respite, and Veterans who recently became homeless and require safe and stable living arrangements while they seek permanent housing. CERS Programs, either directly or through linkage with community and other VA services, provide time-limited services such as supporting mental health stabilization, SUD treatment services, enhancement of independent living skills, vocational training, and employment services. Emphasis is placed on referral and placement in permanent housing or longer term residential programs utilizing VA and/or community resources. Lengths of stay in CERS typically range from 30 to 90 days with the option to extend based on clinical need.
General requirements: the LDSH or CERS facility must be licensed to operate and be located within Philadelphia, PA.  The facility must also be capable of passing an initial inspection conducted by select personnel from the PVAMC.
NCO 4 is seeking responses from LDSH and CERS facilities that are interested in this procurement and consider themselves to have the resources, capabilities needed to provide the services.  Please respond with your:
1.	Facility name, location, business type, socio-economic status (e.g., Veteran-Owned, Woman-Owned, Disadvantaged Small Business, 8(a), etc.), and person of contact (including telephone number & email address).
2.	Facility information regarding its capabilities and resources available to provide the LDSH or CERS services.
Responses must be submitted by 11:00 AM (EST) November 20, 2015.  Responses to the information requested above may be submitted (1) via email to james.whisner@va.gov, or (2) via postal mail to:

<p>Project Labor Agreements (PLA) on FY16 PN 80412 Health Clinic Addition, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) on the following large scale 2-phase design build construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the State of Hawaii:</p>
<p>FY16 PN 80412 Health Clinic Addition, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii</p>
<p>Project Description: Design and construct a new behavioral health and dental clinic, approximately 77,000 square feet, and three (3) stories high. The addition shall connect to the existing lanai/patio on building 673 via an exterior covered walkway. Supporting facilities shall include utilities, site improvements, and a new electrical substation with a switchgear building. The project shall be designed in accordance with the criteria prescribed in Unified Facilities Criteria 4-510-01, Evidence Based Design principles, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings 4-010-01, barrier free design in accordance with the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standard, and DEPSECDEF memorandum "Access for People with Disabilities 10/31/2008", and applicable energy conservation legislation. The project shall be designed to LEED 2009 for New Construction and Major Renovations, Silver Certified rating standard. Operations and Maintenance Manuals, Commissioning, and Structural Interior Design shall be provided by the Design Build Contractor. Comprehensive Interior Design package shall be by the Design Build Contractor's Designer of Record. The Deign Build Contractor shall demolish the existing dental clinic which is located at Building 660, Schofield Barracks. Due to the constrained nature of the proposed site the Design Build Contractor does not have to plan for future vertical or horizontal expansion of the building. The Design Build Contractor shall design for and provide all UFC 4-510-01 required Utility expansion. The Design Build Contractor shall be responsible for providing all other incidental work necessary to complete the project. The estimated performance of period is 36 months.

<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>FAR 22.503 Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) PLAs are a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of PLAs in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of PLAs will--</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law. (Refer also to FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for PLA and FAR 52.222-34 PLA).<br />(c) Agencies may also consider the following factors in deciding whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for the construction project:<br />(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.<br />(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.<br />(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />(4) PLAs have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.<br />(5) A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br />(6) Any other factors that the agency decides are appropriate.<br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs for this requirement. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions and tables:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation?</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>6. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>7. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please include information on projects completed in the last 2-5 years -</p>
<p><br />Project Name / Location Detailed Project Description <br />Initial Cost Est. / Actual final cost <br />Was the project completed on-time? <br />Number of craft trades present on the project <br />PLA (Y/N) Were there any challenges experienced during project? (delays, investigations, health and safety issues, labor shortages, management / organizational issues, etc)<br /><br />Please provide your project specific comments via e-mail to Mr. Graeme Silva, at graeme.l.silva@usace.army.mil, no later than November 20, 2015.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) is conducting a Sources Sought/Request for Information to determine any interest and capability of potential sources for the requirements described below.  
MVP is a national, voluntary research program funded by the VA's Office of Research and Development.  The goal of MVP is to partner with Veterans receiving care in the VA Healthcare System to study how genes affect health. To do this, MVP is building one of the world's largest medical databases by safely and securely collecting blood samples and health information from one million Veteran volunteers. Data collected through MVP will be stored and coded for use in research on diseases like diabetes, cancer, and military-related illnesses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. 
VA requests that interested parties review the VA MVP website at http://www.research.va.gov/MVP/
MVP is looking for information on commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) product(s) which is/are Application Program Interface (API) capable, utilizes a services-oriented architecture platform, and provides or can interface with an application that provides the following:
"	Secure Identity Management and Authorization utilizing existing industry best practices to provide identity management services in conjunction with VA, DOD, or MVP identity management services
"	Secure Identity Management and Authorization utilizing existing industry best practices to identify potential candidates for the MVP
"	Secure bidirectional communication between MVP and participants and/or candidates across multiple modes of communication (e.g. physical mail, email, text, mobile application, desktop application, interactive voice response) either natively or presents a platform that allows modular integration with other applications.  Maintain a library of content to enable easily customizable messages.
"	Support workflow requirements of MVP staff, MVP participants, and MVP candidates
"	Support most or all of the following and provide modular integration with other applications as needed to capture participant generated data including  MVP study surveys , demographic information, communication preferences, data from wearable, mobile, or "internet of things" sensors, bio-specimen identification and location, ambulatory or home medical devices or tests.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information for Local Exchange Services for US Air Force
<SOLNBR>FA8773-16-C-1000
<RESPDATE>121115

<CONTACT>Robin Wiley-Greene, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 4057341400, Email robin.wileygreene@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1. The 38th Contracting Squadron (38 CONS), Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma is seeking information to obtain solutions and approaches from industry regarding performance of local exchange access services for the Department of Air Force to include US Air Force Bases, US Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units located within CONUS and US territories.</p>
<p>1.2. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at https://www.fbo.gov/. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1. A communication service authorization (CSA) is for local exchange access services, analog and digital access transport services, and intra-Local Access Transport Area (LATA) interconnect functions. Currently, the Government's requirement is for telecommunications vendors to deliver Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability at the Government demarcation point at the site. Vendors usually provide all transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions at the designated demarcation point. This includes a vendor's ability to install PRIs and the capability to port all currently existing DIDs and Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSLs) where applicable. These services include any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure compatible with the Government's current infrastructure. The vendor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up to its termination point. Access to the local exchange includes: operator assistance, emergency 911/E911 services/functions, circuits/trunks to the base Demarcation Point (DMARC) and 911/E911 database maintenance where applicable. These services do not include residential/business services for non-Government entities or Government Contractors. Vendors must follow all Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Public Utility Commission (PUC), Department of Defense (DOD), Air Force (AF) and industry standards and guidelines for local exchange access requirements.</p>
<p>2.2. CSA Limitations: Long distance and wireless services are not authorized on a CSA. All long distance services are being provided under the Networx contract, or any subsequent follow-on contract, established by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Currently, Government funding limitations hinder the ability to upgrade from legacy switch/analog infrastructure to current market technology.</p>
<p>2.3. Standard Government Qualification Requirements for Vendors: Vendors should be able to provide local exchange access services to the AF per the site-specific requirements. Qualification requirements are:</p>
<p>&bull; Registered under NAICS Code of 517110 (wired telecommunications carriers)<br />&bull; Interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements with the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) in the states where services are provided, if applicable<br />&bull; Certification with the state PUC as a certified telecommunications service provider in the states where services are to be provided<br />&bull; Current applicable tariffs for the states where service is being provided<br />&bull; Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website and have no exclusions from doing business with the Government</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1. There are many vendors that provide local exchange access services to businesses and various entities in the commercial marketplace. The main goal of this RFI is to obtain constructive information from industry vendors to aid the 38th CONS in our review of policies and processes for the acquisition of local exchange access services. Your responses to the following questions will assist us in this goal and aid in issuance of future solicitations and contracts that are more conducive to industry standards and practices in the commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>3.2. Please provide a response to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What type of contract vehicle(s) has your company found to be most effective when providing local exchange access services for other Government Agencies (i.e., GSA contracts, Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), Basic Agreements, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA), C or D type contracts, etc.)?<br />2. How does your company provide local exchange access services for other commercial companies outside of the Government?<br />3. If your company is a current provider of local exchange access services for another Government Agency, how does the AF CSA process limit your company as a provider when compared to other Government Agency processes?<br />4. What contract type is more conducive to provide local exchange access services for the AF?<br />5. What pricing structure/Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) is more practical for your company (i.e., firm fixed price (FFP), fixed price with economic price adjustment (FP-EPA), etc.)?<br />6. Taxes, fees and surcharges fluctuate; therefore, what pricing structure does your company suggest for these services?<br />7. Does your company have any subcontracting/partnership/joint venture/teaming arrangements currently for local exchange access services? If so, does your company find this a successful approach in providing these services?<br />8. Is your company an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC), Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), or at times both?<br />9. How would your company, as a provider, prefer to receive payments (Government Purchase Card (GPC), Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD), and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF))?<br />10. Are there restrictions, such as local access and transport areas (LATA), which affect the way your company is able to provide services in different geographical areas? If so, explain.<br />11. Is there any condition or action in the CSA solicitation that may restrict competition to local exchange access services? If so, explain.<br />12. Are there other alternatives to provide services other than by individual site, such as regionally, by state, etc.? If so, explain.<br />13. Do LATA's still present limitations with current technology?<br />14. Does your company have tariffs on file with state public utilities commissions or does your company use catalog pricing? If so, please provide web address to information.<br />15. Does your company plan to discontinue providing legacy services, such as analog trunks and switches? If so, please provide dates of discontinuance and identify the legacy services your company will no longer provide. In addition, provide your company's replacement solution(s) for these legacy services.<br />16. In accordance with (IAW) Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 239.7405, the contracting officer may enter into a telecommunications contract for a period not to exceed a total of ten years. What is your company's preferred period of performance for local exchange access services?<br />17. IAW FAR 41, telecommunications are not considered a utility. Does your company perceive local exchange access services as a utility or a service? <br />18. Does your company have any active/current interconnection agreements with other companies to provide local exchange access services? If so, please provide a list of the companies' names and applicable states for the agreements.<br />19. If your company has an interconnection agreement with an ILEC, and the ILEC chooses to discontinue legacy services during your company's period of performance, how does your company plan to continue to provide legacy services for the Government?</p>

<CONTACT>Bari R. Brooks
<DESC>he U.S. Department of Energy `s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) intends to award a sole source contract to Standard and Poor?s Financial Services LLP (Standard & Poor), a large business, to provide licensed access to its Capital IQ (CIQ) and Ratings Direct services and Risk Solutions scorecards. The contract shall be for five years.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 , other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. Standard & Poor is the only top tier credit rating agency whose ratings are compatible with the LPO internal credit rating scoring system. Further LPO utilizes custom scorecards created by and modeled after Standard & Poor which are not congruent to the methodologies used by other top tier credit agencies.  As such, Standard & Poor is the only responsible source to fulfill the LPO requirement. 
This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. If a firm believes that DOE should not pursue this procurement with Standard & Poor then it should submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement by 11:00 a.m. EST on November 23, 2015 via email to Bari.Brooks@hq.doe.gov. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Mr. Roland Draxler provide support for the ARL HYSPLIT model.  Period of performance:  Requirement is for a one year period after award.
<p>NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) conducts research on the development and improvement of atmospheric dispersion models. These models are used by NOAA in a variety of applications ranging from relatively infrequent events such as nuclear accidents and volcanic eruptions to more routine air quality simulations of smoke from wild fires or airborne fine particulate from dust storms. The HYSPLIT model is the main modeling tool developed at ARL for these kinds of applications. The research supporting the development of this model is based on the continuous addition of new modules representing the most recent scientific advances in transport and dispersion simulations. The goals of this contract are to improve the HYSPLIT model's user interface and develop its training materials. This work requires deep knowledge of HYSPLIT's principles of operation, and familiarity with the different model applications. ARL is seeking a part time consultant that can provide advice and assistance in the development of  (1) new procedures to configure model simulations that would reduce the incidence of user input errors, (2) stand-alone computer based methods to update and analyze transfer coefficient matrices created by HYSPLIT simulations, (3) new and updated training materials that can be used by participants in the annual HYSPLIT workshop, (4) and participate in the annual HYSPLIT workshop as an instructor.  The consultant should also be available intermittently to participate in conference calls and face-to-face meetings as needed by ARL scientists.  The consultant is not required to be on-site except for the intermittent meetings and participation in the annual workshop.  The advice provided by the consultant will be in the form of computer software, web pages, written reports, telephone, and direct meetings. The consultant is responsible for their own computing requirements. No access to government computers will be provided.  ARL scientists will integrate the consultant's work products into ARL's computing environment.</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed<br />-1	Simulation error reduction encompasses the development of a program that will analyze all the HYSPLIT input files for consistency with respect to the user selected parameters and reset the inputs as needed, with user confirmation, to achieve the desired results.<br />-2	Transfer coefficient matrices (TCM) created by HYSPLIT simulations represent the mass contribution of each pollutant release time to all downwind locations.  A scripted procedure is required that can be easily run to use the most current TCM files and apply the time-varying emission rates to create various output graphics.<br />-3	The annual HYSPLIT workshop relies upon approximately 88 web pages of technical material describing the theory and operation of HYSPLIT using scripted examples.  These pages need to be updated based upon user and staff comments from the last workshop and new materials need to be added to describe new HYSPLIT features.<br />-4	The consultant should be available for the entire HYSPLIT workshop (3 to 4 days) to provide instruction to the workshop participants on any of the sections as required by ARL.<br />-5	ARL may request the participation of the consultant in meetings, in-person, by telephone, or through web conference calls to discuss the development of the existing tasks or to solicit advice on other dispersion model related issues.<br />Deliverables<br />&bull;	Brief quarterly reports summarizing work done in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required service.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  A contract will be issued in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This solicitation is a small business set aside.  The associated FSC for this is F999, and the associated NAICS Code is 541690.</p>

Replacing this system to restore full functionally is critical in order for NOAA to continue providing high-quality data acquisition during hydrographic, fisheries and oceanographic survey missions on NOAA vessels.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<p>Issue Date: 06 NOV 2015 - Closing Date: 20 NOV 2015 - 4:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for procurement of the Single color Diode Pumped Laser Designator (P/N 68800000-19), Dual Beam Emitter and Receiver (P/N 68902000-9), Tri-Beam Emitter and Receiver (P/N 68901300-19) as spare/replacement items, for failure analysis and repair of failed MTS units. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Northrop Grumman Guidance and Electronics Company, Inc., 2787 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Apopka, FL, 32703, (CAGE 34860). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of design specifications and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The duplicative cost and delay necessitated are from software release to incorporate new laser functionality, flight test, redundant Government depot infrastructure, training of artisans, updates to Government O, I, and D level manuals and weapons test. The Government is seeking information from companies mitigating the sole source basis listed above.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government requirement and qualification requirements for Single color Diode Pumped Laser Designator (P/N 68800000-19), Dual Beam Emitter and Receiver (P/N 68902000-9), Tri-Beam Emitter and Receiver (P/N 68901300-19) as spare/replacement items, for failure analysis and repair of failed MTS units.</p>
<p>Responses should include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution, as well as, whether a demonstration unit can be provided to expedite the Government decision making process.</p>
<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-16-S-NB08</p>
<p>Responses received may submit corporate expertise information if you would like to be considered a possible interested source. Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable option for future requirement; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.

<SOLNBR>YA1323-16-MS-0001
<CONTACT>Donna Cornish, Contracting Officer/Contract Specialist, Phone 3017634514, Email donna.cornish@census.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Census Bureau plans to acquire the services of a Prime Contractor that can manage the design, development, integration, testing, deployment, and operation of geographically dispersed, and possibly intricate subsystems, processes, and staff, into a cohesive and secure customer service solution for the 2020 Decennial Census Questionnaire Assistance (CQA) program. The 2020 Census will gather information from approximately 150 million US households. The 2020 Census operational model calls for a web-first approach, requesting respondents to use a Census Web interface as the preferred means of completing the 2020 Census Questionnaire. The 2020 CQA operations will provide multi-channel assistance to respondents completing the web-based 2020 Census Questionnaire or who have questions about the 2020 Census process itself, as well as have the ability to collect respondent questionnaire data over the phone. 2020 CQA will deliver human and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone assistance to callers as well as utilize email and Web chat channels. Outbound operations will provide support associated with maintaining and improving quality, such as verifying or completing respondent information. The Government plans to execute the 2020 CQA program through a series of phases, including two major exercises leading to the 2020 Census:<br /><br />Phase 1A: The 2017 Census Test will test selective elements of the 2020 Census systems along with the integration between the contractor's systems and those of the Census Bureau. The Government will work with the contractor to evaluate the 2017 Census Test and to incorporate lessons learned into the 2018 End-to-End Test Plan. The 2017 Test will run from approximately mid-March 2017 through mid-July 2017.<br /><br />Phase 1B: The 2018 End-to-End Test will test operational systems and their associated procedures to ensure that they are ready to support 2020 operations. The 2018 End-to-End Test will run from approximately late January 2018 through mid-July 2018<br /><br />Phase 2: The 2020 Census. April 1, 2020 is 2020 Census Day. Operations will run from approximately late January 2020 and end in early September.<br /><br />Phase 3: Lessons Learned/Closeout. <br /><br />The Government and the Contractor will take part in the 2017 Census Test and 2018 End-to-End Test jointly using realistic scenarios and selected geographical areas of the US. The contractor will support all phases of the 2020 CQA lifecycle including the planning and testing that leads to the 2020 CQA and Outbound Operations, the 2020 Census execution, and a limited period of post-production activities. <br /><br />The acquisition strategy will utilize the advisory multi-step process (hereafter called "voluntary down select") as described in FAR 15.202. "Step One" is the release of a Draft Request for Proposal/Pre-Solicitation Notice that will generally describe the scope and purpose of the 2020 CQA acquisition. The Draft Request for Proposal/Pre-Solicitation Notice is scheduled for release by about mid November 2015 and will contain sufficient information to permit potential offerors to make an informed decision about whether to participate in this acquisition (i.e., they possess demonstrated past experience as a prime successfully managing programs of similar size, scope, and complexity). The notice will request information on similar experience and prime contractor points of contact (POCs) for that experience. For evaluation purposes, POCs will be contacted to evaluate "how well" prime contractors performed work, and similar experience summaries will reflect "whether" prime contractors have performed work similar in scope and magnitude to the 2020 CQA requirements. In the "Step One" process, offerors will be evaluated on a "GO/NO GO" basis. The Census Bureau will evaluate only the Prime Contractor's performance and experience. Performance and experience submitted by any subcontractors or teaming partners will not be evaluated as part of the advisory down select process. The Government will only consider the performance and experience of the prime contractor. Offerors that are evaluated as "NO GO" will receive in writing the general basis for the Census Bureau's finding that it is unlikely the offeror is a viable competitor. In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), the offeror will also be advised, "Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition." After the voluntary down-select process, the Census Bureau will publish on their website the names of the Prime Contractors invited to proceed to step two. Small businesses are encouraged to contact these companies for subcontracting opportunities.<br /><br />"Step Two" of the evaluation process involves the release of the formal RFP in January 2016 to offerors invited to participate in the acquisition and all others who choose to submit a proposal in spite of the Government's finding that it is unlikely that the offeror is a viable competitor. Based upon the evaluations of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the Contracting Officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of all the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306(c)(2).<br /><br />All offerors that are within the competitive range will enter discussions/technical interchange with the government. During the technical interchange, offerors will provide a technical demonstration, at their own expense, of a contact center solution for a representative scenario. The expectations for the demonstration will be released in the draft and final Request for Proposal. During the technical interchange period, the Census Bureau will also hold discussions with the offerors followed by the request for final proposal revisions for evaluation.&nbsp;Contract award is scheduled for June 2016.<br /><br />The CQA Contract Management Office will conduct a pre-proposal conference at the Census Bureau Headquarters in January 2016. This conference will discuss the aforementioned contractual requirements in the context of the 2020 CQA technical and management requirements, as well as a discussion of the acquisition strategy.<br /><br />As soon as details become available regarding the pre-proposal conference, the Census Bureau will post the information on its website at <a href="http://www.census.gov">www.census.gov</a>.</p>

Performance of this contract requires contractor personnel to have a successfully adjudicated background investigation (BI), a secret security clearance, and a Federal government-issued personal identification card before being allowed unsupervised access to a DOl facility and/or information system. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be the sponsoring official, and will initiate the process for personal identity verification, BI, security clearance, and card issuance.
At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require physical and/or logical access for performance of work under this contract.

 PIV Form
Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination.  Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for an unfavorable security and suitability decision and denial or revocation of credentials.  Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.
Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary.
During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.  Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours.  Replacement will be at the contractor's expense.  If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>All quotes submitted will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability, Satisfactory Past Performance &amp; Price. The government will issue award to the offeror whose proposal is the Lowest Price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined technically acceptable &amp; that demonstrates satisfactory past performance.</p>
<p>Submittals;<br />It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to make a determination of your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>(1) Technical Acceptability - to be determined technically acceptably offerors shall submit, for evaluation, documentation of their capability to complete the required deliveries in accordance with the project Scope-of-Work, including but not limited to, the capability to provide the items specified, and complete delivery and installation on schedule and as specified.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide sufficient documentation of their technical capability, by including technical literature, brochures, equipment list, Key Personnel List, Resumes, or any other information to enable the Government to determine the offeror's capability to perform work.</p>

Past performance information of key personnel and crew may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available. The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>

In return, VA receives cash and/or goods, services, facilities, or other "in-kind" consideration. To date there have been over 60 EULs executed nationally. Examples of projects executed via EUL include senior housing for Veterans, transitional and permanent housing for homeless Veterans, affordable housing for Veterans, assisted Living for Veterans, medical and research facilities, parking garages, child care centers/adult day health care and VA Office Co-locations.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Regional Specialist position was developed in response to a significant increase in USAID's portfolio of countries that face various forms of fragility or crisis as well as an increase in demand for OTI's experience and programming methodology.  As USAID's lead operational unit for crisis intervention and political transition programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially-based technical advice and analysis, and explore countries that face possible political crises earlier in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.<br /> <br />As a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI  FPD Team, the Senior Regional Specialist will be based in Bangkok, Thailand and will report to the Washington-based OTI Deputy FPD Chief (Programs). As the senior OTI representative in the field, the Senior Regional Specialist will represent and serve as a liaison between OTI and a wide array of individuals and institutions including USAID Field Missions, other DCHA office representatives, regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad on political transition, conflict and post-conflict. The Senior Regional Specialist will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs as well as proposed and potential country program sites, when required serving as OTI's senior official. The Senior Regional Specialist will serve as the agent of  OTI FPD Management and the relevant Team Leader and, when designated, will have supervisory authority when working with OTI country teams. This position will include extensive travel and will be a resource for all OTI field programs.</p>
<p>The Senior Regional Specialist will train, mentor, backstop, and support OTI country teams, including Country Representatives, Deputy Country Representatives, and other staff, on the OTI business model, procedures, minimum program requirements, and best practices. He or she will help to determine the learning and training needs of in-country staff, and contribute to broader office policy and process discussions to promote state-of-the-art transition programming. Through coordination with OTI's Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will stay abreast of current thinking, policy determinations, lessons learned and best practices from other regions, while at the same time working closely with OTI ABC to cultivate, shape, document, and share best practices found in the field. Through on-the-ground knowledge of OTI country programs, the Senior Regional Specialist will contribute to the refinement of OTI's learning and training strategy, training regimes, and materials for staff in country programs as well as office surge staff known as the Bullpen.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Senior Regional Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Regional Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI FPD Chief or designee, with an additional direct line of reporting to the Director of the USAID Regional Development Mission, the OTI Senior Regional Specialist will perform the following duties:<br /> <br />&bull;	Provide technical assistance and support to regional and bilateral missions experiencing political transition, conflict, and post-conflict issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expertise to OTI, including the Senior Leadership Team, regional teams, and the ABC Team, on strategic planning for the office;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support ongoing OTI programs on a temporary duty (TDY) or remote basis, including but not limited to serving as Acting Country Representative when required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor developments related to OTI's mission and mandate. Provide ongoing analysis and regular reporting to the Deputy FPD Chief (Programs) and/or relevant regional team(s) on current political developments, security concerns and other pertinent information from the region for informed decision-making;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a lead mentor, trainer, and advisor to OTI field staff and other members of in-country Senior Management Teams (including implementing partner staff where appropriate) on OTI's business model, programming methods, knowledge management, and program performance management. In addition, support OTI's pool of intermittent Transition Advisors (i.e., the OTI FPD "bullpen") by developing their skills as trainers and practitioners in relation to the same range of topics;</p>
<p>&bull;	Lead the conceptualization and development of a comprehensive approach for training and supporting OTI and implementing partner (IP) staff on the full range of OTI strategic approaches, field systems, and program performance management processes;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with counterparts on OTI's ABC Team to design and procure, as necessary, appropriate tools and resources that support staff and program learning in complex environments;</p>
<p>&bull;	In consultation with OTI's ABC Team, contribute to the development of guidance and training materials on core OTI programming topics including context analysis, program and strategic design, knowledge management, monitoring and evaluation, program performance management, and staff development;</p>
<p>&bull;	As required serve as OTI's representative, regional focal point and liaison for new country start-ups, strategic analysis and dialogue with senior U.S. Government officials and representatives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Use initiative, under minimal guidance, to develop strategic approaches that further OTI's objectives in the field, particularly in the area of capacity development of field staff;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other related duties as assigned by OTI/Washington in support of OTI's worldwide mission, including other representational duties in support of OTI programs if required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Regional Specialist will be supervised by the OTI FPD Chief or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, and will also have additional reporting responsibilities to the relevant Mission Director when applicable.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives or influence on the overall program.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, country start-ups, and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

However, the position also requires travel throughout the region, which may require additional safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><br />COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a pre-priced blanket purchase agreement (BPA), etc. for commercial items, as described under the paragraph below titled "Requirement."&nbsp; The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. An agreement, if any, will be made with the responsible offeror who submits a proposal that (1) conforms to the requirements of the synopsitation; (2) represents the best value to the Government, prices and factors considered. The Contracting Officer may choose to issue multiple awards. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award at all depending upon (1) the quality of proposals received and (2) the price fair and reasonableness of proposals received.</p>
<p>Synopsitation Number: FA8601-16-A-0001</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 621511</p>
<p>Requirement: The 88 MDG is tasked to perform various lab tests to assist with diagnosing patient maladies. The Government does not have the in house capability to perform all tests required. Services are to be provided in accordance with the Performance Work Statement, which is located at Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 16 Nov 2015 through 15 Nov 2020. The BPA will be written for a period of five (5) years, during which the Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA. Therefore, a BPA does not include a minimum purchase requirement or maximum dollar limitation. The Government is not obligated to make any calls against the BPA, which may be cancelled by the Government or the contractor in accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the BPA Terms of Agreement. For additional information on BPAs refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.303.</p>
<p>All prospective awardees are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Prior to BPA award, your company must be registered with SAM.</p>
<p>All Contractors must also have a DUNS number. The DUNS number is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A DUNS number will be <br />Provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror.

<p>(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor.

<p>(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;</p>
<p>(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;</p>
<p>(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and</p>
<p>(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>

R - District II Tribal Court Review service for the Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Office of Justice Services (OJS), Tribal Justice Support. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541199.

This acquisition is being solicited accordance with FAR Part 13.003 and DIAR 1480.504-1, as a total Indian Economic Enterprise Set-aside. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be a multi-year contract from contract award to September 30, 2018. See the SOW for complete performance requirement details. The resultant contract will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract as defined in FAR 16.2. The Government intends to make a single contract award. See Clause and SOW section for details.

The mission of the Tribal Justice Support Directorate (TJS), a division within the Office of Justice Services (OJS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior (DOI) is to further the development, operation, and enhancement of tribal justice systems and Courts of Indian Offenses. The United States Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized that tribal justice systems are the appropriate forum for adjudicating civil disputes and some limited criminal actions within Indian country. Most recently, Congress expanded the criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts under the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010; and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  To that end, TJS is mandated to provide training, technical assistance and limited funding to tribal justice systems. 25 U.S.C.  3611. In an effort to assist tribal justice systems in administering justice fairly and with the utmost integrity, one of TJSs tasks is to perform tribal court assessments intended to assist in defining specific technical assistance and training needed by tribal courts. 25 U.S.C.  3612.

Tribal Court Assessments can assist TJS in focusing on the universal needs of tribal justice systems as well as the specific individualized needs of tribal courts. Thus, these assessments are intended to identify and provide areas of training and technical assistance in matters such as criminal prosecution, foster care issueincluding Title IV-E issues, Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) issues, juvenile issues, and guardianshiptribal probate issues, tort and liability issues which occur on Indian lands and are regulated by tribal codes. TJS has determined that the tribal court assessments will utilize the Trial Court Performance Standards (TCPS) model that defines optimal court performance and is viewed as a blueprint for improving the administration of justice by focusing on performance, self-assessment and self-improvement of the trial justice system. TJS also conducts regular in-service meetings that focus on creating a universally consistent document. 

In addition to providing guidance for TJS on appropriate training, these tribal court assessments provide a conceptual framework of performance areas, community perception, focus on tribal courts operational activities, codes, procedures, and budget limitations.  For tribes, the assessments may be used to formulate a baseline to measure improvement and performance. Moreover, the tribal court assessments are often a basis of one-time funding decisions made by TJS. The assessments are important in many BIA programmatic coordinated efforts. These reviews provide a detailed database of tribal courts that will include tribal codes, judicial decisions and court profiles.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems.

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Architect-Engineer services. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />1. GENERAL INFORMATION: <br /><br />The US Army Corps of Engineers, Middle East District, hereby solicits for A-E Services via Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) to be procured with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-582, as amended: 40 U.S.C. 541) and Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The services will include civil work requirements determined primary from requests by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that support multi-billion dollar infrastructure improvement programs. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award up to two (2) A-E Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOCs), with an estimated overall capacity of ninety million dollars ($90,000,000.00), ($45 million each) under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders not to exceed maximum limits. The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs. Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $15,000,000 in average annual receipts. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. The contract is anticipated to be awarded in second quarter of FY 2016 for the initial one-year period. All large business firms, selected for this contract, must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price or labor-hour task orders. It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed between the two design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. These large-scale civil works program requirements will primarily be within countries of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. <strong>The awarded contracts will be focused on projects in the GCC, but may be used to support other missions of the Middle East District.</strong> <br /><br />TAM subcontracting goals are as follows: <br />(a) 7% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women. Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS). This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. <br /><br />To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM internet site at https://www.sam.gov. <br />NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S. firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms. <br /><br />2. PROJECT LOCATION: <br /><br />A-E services to support mission execution throughout the CENTCOM AOR and, in particular, the GCC countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE (United Arab Emirates), and Oman. <br /><br />3. SERVICES REQUIRED: The specific nature of the work to be performed will be addressed within task order scopes of work.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-15-Q-0252. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) has a need for contractor to provide support to implement VA's Enhanced-Use Lease program so as to enable the Department to formulate, evaluate, and execute multiple enhanced-use leases on a nation-wide basis. The Enhanced-Use Lease Authority (EUL), Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to out lease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to improve services, provide facilities, and/or generate revenue. EULs are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VA's jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector. The facility can be used for both VA and compatible non-VA uses. In return, VA receives cash and/or goods, services, facilities, or other "in-kind" consideration. To date there have been over 60 EULs executed nationally. Examples of projects executed via EUL include senior housing for Veterans, transitional and permanent housing for homeless Veterans, affordable housing for Veterans, assisted Living for Veterans, medical and research facilities, parking garages, child care centers/adult day health care and VA Office Co-locations. VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firms must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by November 10, 2015 and a response to the questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 531390 (Other activities related to real estate). This solicitation closes on Thursday November 12, 2015 by Noon (EST). Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov or 202 461 6849. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified at www.vetbiz

<DESC>This amendment is to change the site visit date from 11/10/15 to 11/13/15 and to change the solicitation closing date from 11/24/15 to 12/01/15.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Eastern Logistics Service Area-ASO, College Park, GA, is issuing a Request for Offer (RFO) to perform the Supplemental Air Conditioning Installation at the Atlanta Network Management Center, Hampton, GA.

It is the intent of the FAA to attempt to award a contract on a set aside basis to an eligible socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) that has been expressly certified by the Small Business Administration for participation in its 8(a) program, provided that adequate competition is received and an award can be made at a fair market price.  

Adequate competition is defined as at least two (2) competitive offers received from qualified, responsible business concerns.

The NAICS code for this acquisition is 238220  Plumbing, Heating and Air-Conditioning Contractors and the small business size standard is $15 million average.
The estimated Cost magnitude for this project is:
	-Between $250,000 and $500,000

Projected Period of Performance for this project is 60 calendar days.

Per AMS clause 3.8.2-9, Site Visit, Offerors or Quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

<DESC>This amendment hereby replaces the original sources sought, posted on 30 October 2015.  Changes include an updated attachment A and attachment B that clarify and update the users requirements for this potential procurement.

NAVFAC is soliciting feedback regarding the eventual procurement of a commercial, non-armored, EOD vehicle that will replace the current Continental United States and Outside Continental United States (CONUS and OCONUS) shore detachment response capability of the vehicle.
  The EODRT will be a highly mobile, wheeled vehicle platform with a full suite of mission equipment and communications and electronics capabilities specifically designed for C4ISR, explosive hazards and EOD operations.  Some of the government equipment that will be used will be stored and transported within the vehicle requires power connections, storage bins and computer work station environments.

Additionally, NAVFAC is requesting feedback regarding what capabilities are commercially available, in accordance with stated requirements.   Interested parties are asked to identify any item(s) that may be difficult to install or integrate, or may be considered cost drivers for vehicle modification.

All interested parties are invited to submit responses (see revised Attachment B) describing their ability to perform the work requirements or describing any products with similar capabilities.

<DESC>The Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) located in Vallejo, CA is conducting market research regarding the use of Bundling for VA101-15-R-0148; Project Number is 664-401, Spinal Cord Injury/Community Living Center Building and Parking Structures at the San Diego VA Medical Center in San Diego, California.  Please provide comments to me within fifteen (15) days from the posting date of this announcement.  Contract bundling is defined as consolidating two or more procurement requirements for goods or services previously provided or performed under separate, smaller contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single contract that is unlikely to be suitable for award to a small business concern.

 Federal Acquisition Regulation states that market research may indicate that bundling is necessary and justified if an agency or the Government would derive measurably substantial benefits.  Measurably substantial benefits may include, individually or in any combination or aggregate, cost savings or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits. 

Both the Spinal Cord Injury/Community Living Center Building (SCI/CLC) and the two parking structures are critical to the success of the ongoing VA mission and delays to acquisition would be detrimental to both the overall project phasing (including future acquisition) and the ongoing missions being carried out on the VA San Diego campus.  Specifically, delays to acquisition and construction of the new SCI/CLC would adversely affect the delivery of healthcare to veterans while similar delay of the parking structures would result an unmanageable situation on the campus.  The parking structures are designed to be constructed adjacent to each other with the SCI/SLC building across from the parking structures.  Compounding this are two significant construction projects, the City of San Diego Trolley construction and the UCSD Gilman Road realignment project.  Both projects are within the proximity of the VA San Diego Campus and will exacerbate the issues with safety coordination, parking and work-area overlapping boundary problems during construction.

The SCI/CLC building is a single 4-story, 180,000 square feet building consisting of 3 SCI floors, with the top 4th floor assigned to CLC residents.  The road between the SCI/CLC and parking structures will involve utility trenches and extensive site grading.  Space for contractor staging/laydown and material storage is limited.  The estimated magnitude for this project is more than $100 Million.
The larger parking structure is designed for 800 spaces.  The estimated magnitude for this project is between $10 and $20 Million.
The smaller parking structures will contain 400 parking spaces.  The estimated magnitude for this project is between $5 and $10 Million.

Aspects of the construction associated with the SCI/CLC and two parking structures that could be separated without adverse impact to safety, schedule, or medical center operations have been broken out as separate contract packages to be advertised in later phases in an attempt to mitigate the adverse impact to opportunities for small business.  These separate contract packages are likely to generate interest from more than one small business and market research may demonstrate them suitable for small business set asides.  These projects include: (1) CLC Hospice, estimated magnitude between $5 and $10 Million, (2) Building 11 seismic retrofit estimated magnitude between $10 and $20 Million.

Within fifteen (15) days of the posting date of this announcement, please provide comments to noella.bond@va.gov.

<DESC>A sole source award was made to North Carolina University, Office of Research, Innovation and Economic Development.<br /><br />USDA-ARS acquired 40 lanes of genetic sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq Platform.&nbsp; The relevant&nbsp;research is a continuation of ongoing wheat and barley genotyping protocols being conducted over an extended time period. Using the same supplier for the completion of these studies minimizes the study variables and maximizes consistency of study results. Proximity of the North Carolina State Genomic Sciences Laboratory to the Plant Science Research unit allows ARS personnel to oversee sample preparation and quality control. This close proximity also allows for quick turn-around for time sensitive projects and ease of transfer of very large data files.
