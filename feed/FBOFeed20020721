The purpose of this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from qualified firms interested in competing for this requirement, 2) identify possible opportunities for small business participation, 3) identify the nature of the requirement and 4) to identify the acquisition strategy for this procurement.  The potential contractor(s) selected for award must meet the qualifications stated in the Act, and have the expertise, experience, resources, financial capability (must be financially capable to start up operations, hiring, uniforms, etc.), and evidence of successful past performance for like or similar work, and judged to offer the lowest risk and provide the highest probability of success.  It is anticipated at this time that a Time & Materials type contract award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Contract type recommendations will be solicited from potential vendors.  TSA may make one or more awards for this effort.  Please read this announcement carefully and if you plan to respond, please do so in accordance with the specific instructions provided.  

TSA has established the following subcontracting goals for the program: 40% of subcontracting dollars awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5% to Women owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business.  This announcement is seeking sources that can best meet the Small Business and Small Business subcontracting goals of the Agency.  Evaluation criteria will reflect these goals.  

Purpose of Requirement - 

This pilot program is a two-year program, which begins on November 19, 2002, and will require one or more qualified private screening companies to conduct checkpoint screening, gate screening, and checked baggage screening.  At the conclusion of the two-year period, TSA will evaluate the effectiveness of the private commercial firms.  TSA has selected the following five airports for this pilot program:

San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, CA,
Kansas City International Airport, Kansas City, MO,
Greater Rochester International Airport, Rochester, NY,
Jackson Hole Airport, Jackson, WY,
Tupelo Airport, Tupelo, MS.

TSA will provide oversight of all screening at each airport participating in the pilot program and provide Federal Government law enforcement officers at the airport, however, each selected contractor will be responsible for the successful performance of all requirements of the contract for their respective airport(s).
 
Below are the minimum requirements to be a qualified private screening company:

QUALIFIED PRIVATE SCREENING COMPANY- A private screening company is qualified to provide screening services at an airport participating in the pilot program, if the company will only employ individuals to provide such services who meet all the requirements applicable to Federal Government personnel who perform screening services at airports and will provide compensation and other benefits to such individuals that are not less than the level of compensation and other benefits provided to such Federal Government personnel (see TSA vacancy announcements for Transportation Security Screener, Lead Transportation Security Screener, and Supervisory Tranportation Security Screener at www.usajobs.opm.gov).  The firm must have prior experience in aviation passenger and property security screening at airports.

STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE SCREENING COMPANIES- The TSA will enter into a contract with a private screening company only if the private screening company is owned and controlled by a citizen of the United States.  Provide documentation to support your ability to meet this requirement.

TSA may terminate any contract entered into with a private screening company to provide screening services at an airport under the pilot program if the TSA finds that the company has failed to comply with any standard, regulation, directive, order, law, or contract applicable to the hiring or training of personnel to provide such services or to the provision of screening at the airport.

If interested, you are required to submit evidence that your company meets the minimum qualifications to receive the complete Request For Proposal (RFP).  Only those private screening companies that submit all required information and meet these minimum qualifications will receive the RFP and be eligible to submit a proposal.

Any firm interested in being a prime contractor for this effort must submit a capability statement, not to exceed five pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks identified above.  The information must include a statement of qualifications, a proposed technical concept, staffing resources, and a list of applicable past performance references. Any firm interested in being a subcontractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  Do not merely state that you can meet the requirements, please provide detailed qualifications and references that demonstrate how you meet the requirements.  All subcontracting capability statements will be forwarded to the prime contractors by TSA.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Any information that exceeds the page limitations will be discarded.

All capability statements from potential prime contractors and subcontractors are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at daryl.shall@tsa.dot.gov by no later that 4:00 PM Eastern time on August 5, 2002.  
TSA will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued in August of this year.  As part of the RFP, TSA will forward a Statement of Objectives (SOO) and will ask the potential offerors to respond with their solution to the requirement.  The SOO will include the purpose, scope, period of performance, background, program objectives, and constraints (including security, safety, and accessibility issues).  The selected contractor-proposed statement of work (solution) may be incorporated by reference in to the contract.  Potential awardees will be required to present an oral presentation in Washington, DC as part of this procurement process.
The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen, through this competitive process, based on the ideas and solutions submitted, will be part of a mission critical team responsible with TSA to the success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.
