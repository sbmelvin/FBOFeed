<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE</span></p>
<p>1. This requirement is to provide a full range of responsive environmental remediation actions necessary to protect human health and the environment. It includes rapid response and removal of environmental media contaminations and site restoration activities located on BRAC bases in EPA regions 5-8 (Central). The BECSRC will include a 5-year ordering period with 24 additional months for performance completion.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of setting up each "BECSRC" is to have a PK tool in place for "pop-up" requirements. Pop-ups are frequently occurring small, unplanned and out-of-cycle requirements that typically require a quick initial response from the Air Force. A Requirements Contract is the most suitable contract vehicle 1) because the nature of pop-ups are the AFCEC cannot predetermine the precise quantities of services that will be needed during the ordering/performance period and 2) because requirements contracts are set up with only one contractor to provide service (FAR 16.503) which agreeably shortens the acquisition timeline. AFCEC/CIB has been looking for a way to streamline acquisition timelines to address time sensitive requirements. A Requirements Contract very neatly provides a solution to these issues/considerations.</p>
<p>3. Source selection is being conducting using a phased evaluation process which is sometimes referred to as a "down-select" as well as using Full Trade-off source selection criteria. Volumes I &amp; II will be required in "Phase 1" and Volumes III &amp; IV in "Phase 2". In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than Cost/Price, when combined, are: significantly more important than cost or price. To make the process more efficient, the CO is limiting the amount of information that offerors must submit initially in order to minimize the amount of material interested offerors must prepare and the government must evaluate in order to conduct this source selection.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical<br />Sub-factor 1.1: Managerial Approach<br />Sub-factor 2.1: Corporate Experience<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Cost/Pricing</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; IAW DoD SS procedures and FAR part 15 offerors will be promptly notified in writing if their proposals are excluded from the competitive range or otherwise eliminated from the competition. Evaluation Notices (ENs) will be sent to all offerors within the competitive range instructing them to provide the Phase II volumes of their proposal(s). Volume III is the required Pricing and Volume IV includes a Sample Task Order. Volume III instructions include a Unit Pricing Matrix and a Labor Rates Matrix. The goal is to obtain unit pricing and pre-priced discrete deliverables to the maximum extent practicable in order to streamline proposal preparation and proposal evaluations at the task order level.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to the Center for Health-Related Aerosol Studies at the University of Cincinnati located in Cincinnati, Ohio, to quantitatively evaluate the potential and assess the likelihood and/or risk of contamination from powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) exhaust in an operating room sterile field.
<p>The University of Cincinnati's Center for Health-Related Aerosol Studies is nationally and internationally recognized for its research on respiratory protection, bioaerosol measurement and contamination control (including health-care settings) and other relevant areas. Dr. Grinshpun and his research team have built a unique, state-of-the-art Respirator Performance Evaluation Facility, which includes the aerosol exposure chambers of various size, breathing manikins headforms, breathing recording and simulation system, a fleet of bioaerosol and aerosol measurement devices and aerosol generation instruments, microbiological labs, etc. The research team has conducted numerous studies with human subjects wearing respirators and has recently completed research and submitted/published papers on the performance of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs). The University of Cincinnati team is unique because of the combination of comprehensive expertise in the following three fields: respiratory protection research, aerosol science, and applied microbiology. Furthermore, the Center for Health -Related Aerosol Studies is equipped with unique experimental facilities which no other lab has available. This combination of an outstanding research expertise and a state-of-the-art equipment is crucial for the successful execution of the PAPR exhaust project, and the results of this study could impact the CDC recommendations on the use of PAPRs when caring for patients who have been diagnosed with a contagious illness that can be transmitted via airborne particles.</p>
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within 15 days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any quotation/response must be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov before 11:00 AM on Thursday, March 5, 2015.</p>

<a href="mailto:kevin.gramling@faa.gov">Click here to email Kevin Gramling</a>
<DESC>The FAA proposes to acquire replacement panels, complete radomes, and radome accessory kits necessary for the repair of the 200 L-3 radomes within the National Airspace System (NAS). These assets are expendable and are required to address the critical support issue of ASR-8, ASR-9, ASR-11, BOS, ARSR-1, ARSR-2, ARSR-3, ARSR-4, TDWR, and NEXRAD antenna systems.  The Federal Aviation Administration Logistic Center (FAALC) is responsible for supplying replacement radomes, panels, and accessories to these facilities.
The purpose of the radome is to protect the antenna systems from weather exposure, while allowing minimal interference to RF transmission through the radome.  Each radome is comprised of several radome panels constructed of laminated fiberglass.  These panels have been designed with complex dimensions and specific RF design characteristics.    UV rays and/or storms occasionally damage, the panels causing de-lamination to occur.  These panels lose their structural integrity and leak water onto the antenna system, resulting in radar outage and could compromise air traffic control coverage.  

The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  The radomes were manufactured by L-3 Communications ESSCO in 1995 and are the only know source for replacement panels because they hold the proprietary data rights.  

The FAA does not have design specifications or drawings to allow other sources to manufacture these panels.  The contractor must have access to the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) specifications and drawings in order to manufacture the panels.  Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing proof for rights to use the data from the OEM.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.  Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to the Contracting Officer.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation and the resulting contract is to obtain fully contractor operated and maintained Air Tactical Group Supervisor and Mapping services to perform fire mapping, initial attack, extended attack, and large fire project management in support of the Aerial Firefighting Effectiveness Study and nationwide wildland firefighting operations.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The aircraft, sensors, user interface and recording hardware, software, training, associated equipment, and personnel described within are to be utilized in support of the Aerial Firefighting Use and Effectiveness (AFUE) Study. AFUE is tasked with objectively documenting and developing a consolidated approach, metrics, and system to evaluate the use and contributions of firefighting aircraft in supporting the objectives of wildland fire incidents. <br /><br />This platform may be utilized at any location in the Continental United States or Alaska in which aerially delivered suppressants are being utilized. The general mission profile, excluding ferry, consists of 30-45 minutes to and from the fire, 2-3 hours of data collection over the fire. The crew is generally comprised of the contractor pilot, one AFUE provided aerial supervisor or aerial observer occupying the co-pilot station and an aft crew station which may be staffed by an AFUE provided instructor, trainee, observer, or sensor operator. Data collection consists of the recording of incident radio communications, documenting and processing overall fire behavior (rate of spread, intensity, etc.), targeted repeated observations of suppressant drop footprints and coverage continuity, and targeted fire behavior before, during, and after interactions with suppressant drops. The US Forest Service - AFUE is the sole owner of any data (documents, imagery, audio, etc.) collected during any AFUE mission and maintains complete control of distribution. <br /><br />This is a one year requirement for one airplane with sensor with the option for an additional four (4) years that may be exercised at the unilateral option of the Government. The Mandatory Availability Period is for 180 days per year with the option to extend for additional days and an estimated 300 flight hours per year. This requirement is set-aside 100% for small business and the contract will be issued in accordance with FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR part 15, Contracting by Negotiations.</p>
<p>A Draft Statement of Work is attached and comments on the draft will be accepted through March 9, 2015. Comments shall be submitted in writing to Michael McFarlane at michaelmcfarlane@fs.fed.us.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE: The Milwaukee VA Medical Center has a need for a multi-level parking structure.  This project consists of the construction of a three-level Precast Concrete Parking Structure on the VAMC Milwaukee campus.  The Parking Structure will be located above Parking Lot #4 directly opposite the hospital (Building 111) main east entrance.  The Parking Structure foundation will be on auger cast piles, and the at-grade level will be comprised of poured-in-place concrete strengthened by fiber reinforcement.  The limits of the construction project are Ambulance Way (south), Lincoln Drive (west), Warehouse Way (north), and Surface Parking Lot #5 (east).  The Parking Structure will hold approximately 360 vehicles on four levels of parking:  an at-grade level plus three (3) elevated tiers.  Vehicle access to and egress from the Parking Structure will be from the north at Warehouse Way (Level "LL").  There will be one stair tower at the northwest corner, and one stair/elevator tower at the southwest corner.  Pedestrian access to and egress from the Parking Structure will be at Level "1" at the southwest corner stair/elevator tower and Level "LL" at the northwest stair tower.  The elevator tower consists of two hydraulic elevators which will traverse four distinct levels:  LL, 1, 2, and 3.

The Parking Structure will require three sources of electrical power from Building 111:  Normal, Life Safety, and Equipment Emergency.  There is limited HVAC and plumbing work including a water wash down system for deck maintenance and the appropriate drainage systems to existing sanitary and/or storm sewerage.  Lighting in the Parking Structure will be primarily by LED lighting for energy efficiency and long-life benefits.  For safety and security, there will be emergency "Talk-a-Phones at each level in each of the two stairwells.  The Parking Structure will NOT be served by an emergency generator.  Since the Parking Structure is an open-style structure, a fire suppression (sprinkler) system is NOT required.  The main hospital Fire Alarm system will, however, be integrated with the new Parking Structure.

There are some utility (storm sewer, electric light pole service) relocations as a part of this project.  There are two WE Energies main electrical service feeds in the project vicinity, but at NO POINT should this project have to perform any main electric utility relocation work (already completed via separate contracts).  Significant geotechnical investigations have already been undertaken and are part of the contract documents.  Lincoln Drive will dead-end at the south end in the police parking lot and will not intersect with Ambulance Way so that pedestrians leaving the Parking Structure do not have to cross traffic.  Ambulance Way will be converted to a one-way west-bound traffic road.  There is minimal landscaping work on this project outside of a drainage swale between the Parking Structure and Lincoln Drive.

This structure is located in the sightlines of a National Historic Landmark District.  The design of this Parking Structure was required to meet standards imposed by the National Park System, Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.

Energy Efficiency Requirements:
Federal Executive Order #13423 requires all energy efficient materials, equipment and systems to be evaluated and, if feasible, incorporated into V.A. projects.  The A/E, prime contractor, and all subcontractors shall cooperate with the Federal Government in specifying, evaluating, documenting, purchasing, and installing energy efficient equipment that meet basic energy efficiency criteria established by the V.A.  The Criteria can be defined as comparing total energy savings to total life cycle cost of the equipment.  To accomplish this objective, the A/E shall produce an Energy Equipment Schedule comparing a description of each standard piece of equipment (or system) vs. a description of recommended efficient equipment (or system); including the estimated purchase price, estimated cost to install, maintain, and operate the equipment as well as the estimated annual energy usage and estimated useful life for each piece of equipment (or system). 
All design and installation will be in accordance with current VAMC, HVAC design guides, NEC, NFPA, ASHRAE 90.1, state, local, and all VA and federal codes.  Provide energy savings equipment and design modifications for current energy usage to the most efficient and economical level possible.
The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million dollars. The project magnitude range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.
This procurement is a 100% set-aside for CVE-Verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Firms (SDVOSB)- per the authority 38 U.S.C. 8127 (Public Law 109-461). In accordance with VAAR 819.7003(b), Offerors must be a current CVE verified vendor at the time of submitting an offer.

<DESC>The San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Techniplast USA, Inc. for additional cage racks, air handling units and accessories for a new animal housing unit.  

The SFVAMC currently uses Techniplast USA, Inc. products at multiple facilities to house animals for research purposes.  Continuity of products is critical in the research field.  Animals housed in different cage racks and air handling units would introduce multiple new variables to the animal's environment which would greatly affect research data.  Flexibility to move animals within SFVAMC facilities with like environments is required.  

This sole source action is in accordance with the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements or provide an equal product may give written notification to the Contracting Specialist for consideration. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements. Responses are due by February 20, 2015 at 4:00 PM PST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Responses must be e-mailed to gary.basile@va.gov .  No telephone responses will be accepted.  No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing capability statements will be provided by the Government.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis: The following is a Request for Information (RFI) to gather data for planning purposes. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does it in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government is not liable for any costs incurred by the Contractor in response to this synopsis and therefore will not compensate any Contractor for work performed in response to this synopsis. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.
<p>AFRL/RW, the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate is conducting market research for an exploratory development research program which intends to develop wideband conformal antenna and radome technology that is compatible with high speed air vehicles. New classes of air launched vehicles are being researched that will maintain a sustained Mach 3 to Mach 6+ as they journey to their destination. Wideband antenna and radome technology that will survive the flight and operate correctly in the terminal phase of flight is required. The objective of this program will be to design, simulate, fabricate, and test a wideband conformal antenna and radome technology that is compatible with high speed airframes. The critical areas of this program will be as follows: Wideband conformal antennas with appropriate electrical characteristics to operate with L-band, S-band, and C-band sensors of interest, high fidelity simulation of antenna concepts, protective radome material that is compatible with high speed airframes, and development of test hardware that can survive and operate during testing to emulate flight environmental conditions. This program will emphasize development of a robust design backed by high fidelity computer simulations and the demonstration of critical components.</p>
<p>At this time we are requesting Statement of Capabilities from potential sources on their capability to perform design and development of wideband conformal antenna technology for high speed air frames. Firms having applicable interest, capability, and background should submit their Statement of Capabilities, not to exceed 15 pages in contractor format, by mail to AFRL/RWK, Attention: Kevin R. Miller, Building 13, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810 or via e-mail to kevin.miller.4@us.af.mil no later than 4:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on Thursday, 19 March 2015.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis must be received within 30 days from the date of publication. Contractors responding to this synopsis should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or a small disadvantaged business concern as defined under NAICS 334220 (Size Standard 750 employees) - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. In addition, Contractors shall provide their Contractor Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Mr. Jerome B. Cuenca, Project Manager, AFRL/RWMF, 306 West Eglin Boulevard, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5430, (850) 883-2100, jerome.cuenca@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)

PLEASE NOTE THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER OF THIS SOLICITION WAS DTFAAC-14-R-04721 AND IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DTFAAC-15-R-02523.

It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $960,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size effort applicable to this requirement:
NAICS:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services
Size Standard:  $15.0 Million

This acquisition is an A&E procurement that is obliged to comply with The Brooks Act (40 USC 1101).  The award process involves the evaluation of architectural and engineering services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at fair and reasonable prices.  The evaluation process will not take price into consideration until the most technically qualified and competent firm is selected.

A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).

The A&E firms submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 

1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence- 

The offeror must provide a specific narrative and supporting documentation that describes the offeror's technical and managerial capabilities in the specialized area of environmental A/E services.  Emphasis will be placed on the Contractors experience, especially on contracts for similar services and magnitude, and the depth and breadth of understanding of the solicited requirement as reflected in the proposal.  It includes an evaluation of example projects (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities in each of the following areas:
	Environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit
	Pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects)
	Environmental Compliance
	Air emissions reporting and evaluation projects
	Asbestos Surveys
	Engineering design and specifications
	Environmental remedial investigation, design, and implementation (CERCLA) performed within the last 10 years. 

Offerors are restricted to no more than 6 example projects completed within 5 years to the proposed effort.

These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort; their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables).  Projects completed for the Federal Government in particular should be included, if any.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating successful completion of at least one project in each of the above areas.  Performance will be evaluated as successful when information submitted by the offeror or from client contact confirms that the projects were effective in meeting the intended primary outcome of the project.  For example, a project intended to achieve permit compliance must demonstrate that compliance was achieved.

2. Past Performance on Similar Contracts-
Past performance shall demonstrate how well the offeror delivers quality services; demonstrates ability to achieve program objectives; meet customer expectations; demonstrates ability to manage and meet priority timelines; demonstrates ability to manage expenses; and demonstrate overall performance on work similar in operational and technical complexity to services described in the SOW. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other available sources in the evaluation of past performance.

Offerors shall provide a narrative for each of the example projects (detailed reviews) provided in Factor 1.  Narratives shall include information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders. Offerors shall provide at least two points of contacts for each project who can account for the conditions, effort, and complexity comparable to this requirement.  Aspects of the projects submitted for past performance should be relevant to the requirement for this contract and recent (within five years) to the proposed effort.  The offeror shall clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating that each project met the budget, quality and schedule objectives for the project.  Offerors are restricted to no more than 3 pages per narrative for each example project.

Offerors shall complete Section 1 of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (SIR Attachment 5) and send it along with the Client Authorization Letter (see sample at SIR Attachment 6) to all points of contact (POCs) for the contracts the Offeror identified in its proposal for this factor (a minimum of three, but no more than five for the prime, and maximum of three for each teaming partner/significant subcontractor for contracts completed or underway within the last five years).   The POCs shall be familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature.  The POCs will complete the questionnaires and forward them by email to the Contracting Officer, Kathleen Islas, (Kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov) no later than the SIR closing date.  RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES SHALL NOT SEND THE COMPLETED INFORMATION SHEETS BACK TO THE OFFEROR.  The Source Evaluation Team (SET) will conduct follow-up with any POC as necessary.

Organizational Structure Change History  Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between the conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, offerors shall include a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the offerors company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), the "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts identified, yet general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

 3. Professional Qualifications 

 Offeror shall submit a complete resume of the experience of each line and staff executive, supervisor and technical staff member who will be assigned to work the requirements of this contract.  Resumes should include: name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Resumes of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is needed.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered professional engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.
execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.

4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work Required 

Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload, i.e., total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, provide examples of completed projects and timetables associated with their completion.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources, or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  Information on teaming or subcontracting that will be done with firms having experience within the locales outside of Oklahoma listed above must be provided.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.  The offerors submission will be deemed satisfactory upon demonstrating that it is clearly able to manage the anticipated workload of this contract.

5. Geographic Location-

Offeror shall submit their geographic location relative to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  

Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.

<p>Improvements to the Daniel K. Inouye (DKI) Highway began in 2004, and to date, 41.5 miles of the original 48-mile route have been reconstructed to meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. The easternmost 5.5 miles of the road remain to be reconstructed to complete the overall improvements to the entire route. The proposed DKI Highway (State Route 200) East Side improvement project begins on the west outskirts of Hilo at milepost 5.5 and extends 5.5 miles westward, terminating at Mile Post 11.</p>
<p>The work associated with this project primarily consists of grading, drainage, aggregate base, paving, and incidental roadway improvements, for approximately 2 miles on existing alignment and 3.5 miles on new alignment. The following estimates major work items and quantities:</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) Division of Systems Toxicology (DST) requirement for analysis of D-glucose and deuterium fate isobolomes from hepatocytes.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability and capability of small businesses that can provide services for analyzing glucose and deuterium isobolome in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treated hepatocytes. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380 - Testing Laboratories; Small Business Size Standard is $15.0 million.<br /><br />Statement of Work<br /><br />Objective<br />The overall objective is to acquire services to assist the FDA in the analysis of [1,2-13C2]-D-glucose tracer fate analysis studies in hepatocytes of 26 FDA approved TKI inhibitor drugs.<br /><br />Statement of Need<br />DST requires a Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) analytical analysis of [1,2-13C2]-D-glucose and deuterium fate isobolomes from hepatocytes dosed with 26 TKI drugs. 10 TKI drugs have hepatotoxicity warnings labels and many other TKI have adverse side effects. This study will provide DST information on glucose and deuterium metabolism during TKI-induced hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br />Extend research of 26 FDA approved TKI compounds using multiple metabolite 13C labeling patterns with their deuterium/hydrogen ratios in order to determine DNA and fatty acid deuteration through the oxidative branch of the pentose cycle. These are cell transforming metabolic pathway reactions by multiple deuterium and carbon exchanges. Namely, decreased deuterium to hydrogen ratios with maintained positional 13C labeling in the presence of deuterium depleted water indicate pentose cycle flux for RNA, DNA and fatty acid production (membranes). This is an undesirable drug action to cause aneuploidy advanced cell transformation, which will be measured via targeted 13C and deuterium fate association studies.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />One (1) year after receipt of contract award</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />The offeror shall furnish sufficient information relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration for each of the following qualifications: 1.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <p> I.	SUMMARY <p> The Centennial Challenges Program is NASAs flagship program for technology prize competitions (www.nasa.gov/challenges).  The Centennial Challenges Program directly engages the public, academia, and industry in open prize competitions to stimulate innovation in technologies that have benefit to NASA and the nation.  The program is an integral part of NASAs Space Technology Mission Directorate, which is innovating, developing, testing, and flying hardware for use in NASAs future missions.  For more information about NASAs Space Technology Mission Directorate, visit: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech">http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech </A>	  . <p> The Centennial Challenges program is seeking input on a Space RACE challenge being considered for start in 2015.  The challenge would require competitors to build vehicles capable of autonomous rendezvous, capture, and manipulation of small objects at high speeds with applications for the Mars Sample Return campaign, lunar sample return missions, and many other commercial venues. <p> The purposes of this RFI are: 1) to gather feedback on the competition being considered, 2) to determine the level of interest in potentially competing in this challenge, and 3) to understand the applicability of the technology developed by the competition for other non-government applications. <p> NASA welcomes replies to this RFI from all segments of industry, academia, and government, including associations, innovators, and enthusiasts.  This RFI is for informational/planning purposes only and the Government will not be responsible for any cost associated with preparing information in support of this RFI.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into any agreement or other obligation, or to conduct a Space RACE (Rendezvous And Capture Experiment) challenge. This notice is issued in accordance with the NASA Prize Authority, 51 U.S.C.  20144. Responses may be made available for public review and should not include proprietary information.  Submitted information will be shared within NASA and with contractor personnel associated with the NASA Centennial Challenges Program.  All responses are for general access by government reviewers. <p> For general information on the NASA Centennial Challenges Program see: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/challenges">http://www.nasa.gov/challenges </A>    .  The point of contact is Mr. Sam Ortega, Program Manager, Centennial Challenges Program, Marshall Space Flight Center. <p> II.	BACKGROUND <p> On-orbit sample capture, a special application of Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D), poses several difficult challenges.  These include close-range on-orbit detection, rendezvous, and capture of a very small, passive space object (<20cm diameter).  While there have been several successful AR&D flight systems (e.g., Space Shuttle, Orbital Express, XSS-11, and SpaceX Dragon), a compact and standardized solution for the retrieval of very small passive objects has yet to be demonstrated.  Development of a standard on-orbit sample capture/return spacecraft bus would not only enable NASA missions such as Mars Sample Return and lunar sample return, but also minimize the cost of and the risks to future missions.  The architecture of the Space RACE competition would spark meaningful technical advancements in dynamic tracking, capture, and precision manipulation of small objects, challenges common to both space and terrestrial applications (such as automated packaging and fruit picking).  Space RACE would encourage collaborative innovation between space research and commercial fields. <p> III.	CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION <p> The competition would simulate the autonomous rendezvous, capture, and manipulation of an Orbiting Sample (OS) around Mars or the moon in the form of a head-to-head competition. Competitors would build a vehicle capable of tracking a simulated OS moving around a flat, circular track at 6 m/s, rendezvousing with it, capturing it, and depositing it in a provided Earth Return Vehicle (ERV), all without any off-board systems.  They would then face other competitors in head-to-head matches that consist of two rounds each.  In each round, competitors would first obtain a stable parking orbit at a high altitude towards the outside of the track, 180 degrees apart from the other competitor.	A circular reference line taped to the track at this radius, as well as an angular reference would be provided to assist competitors in reaching this starting state.  <p> Once both competitors are in their parking orbit, a robotic vehicle (referred to as the OS Bot) would be launched from the inside of the track into a parking orbit lane at a lower altitude (smaller radius as compared to the competitors orbit) carrying two OSs mounted on front and rear booms, one for each competitor.  The OS Bot would insert itself into orbit exactly halfway between each competitor and at a constant speed (4 m/s in the first level of the competition, 6 m/s in the second level).  Competitors vehicles would then race to rendezvous, capture, and store their OS in their ERVs, with a small caveat: after the OS is launched, vehicles must remain in a specified speed band of +/- 0.5 m/s of the OS Bots speed.	This would force competitors to change radii to either catch up with or slow down to the OS Bot, simulating orbital mechanics.	Competitors speed, acceleration, and power consumption would be monitored by a provided regulation package, most likely based on ranging radio technology and IMUs, and the ERV would be a container with an OS shaped depression in it requiring control of position and orientation for successful storage of the OS.  The first competitor to accomplish all the above tasks successively would win that round.  The second round would be the same as the first, except that the competitors would switch starting positions (fore and aft of the OS Bot). <p> The OS would be a small white cylinder with reflective fiducial stripes on its surface to assist competitors with tracking.  It would be magnetically mounted on its corner in an asymmetric manner and, in the second level of competition, rotated at a constant rate of 4 RPM.	The magnets would be tuned such that if a competitor impacts the OS, it would fall away from the mount and the competitor would be disqualified from that round. <p> IV.	DRAFT CHALLENGE RULES AND COMPETITION STRUCTURE <p> Competition Schedule <p> The competition would be run in two successive levels with increasing difficulty: <p> 1.	Level 1 a.	OS platform moving at 4m/s b.	OS not rotating 2.	Level 2 a.	OS platform moving at 6m/s b.	OS rotates at 4RPM <p> Within each level, teams would be expected to produce a functioning robot for two phases: <p> 1.	Qualifying Round a.	Successfully demonstrate the following tasks three consecutive times: i.	Static grasping of OS ii.	Ability to maintain parking orbit.  Robot platform must maintain the correct radius and angular position, as specified by the references. 2.	Head to Head a.	Two rounds per match, each round lasting a maximum of 5 minutes. b.	Minimum total time from GO signal to successful placement of OS in Earth Return Vehicle across both rounds c.	Each team would be randomly seeded to compete in three matches each over the course of a day, but guaranteed not to have back-to-back matches.  A five minute setup period would take place between the two rounds in a match, and a ten minute setup period would take place between each match.  Time results of all matches accumulate for each team to assign rankings; teams with lower overall times would be ranked higher.  From these rankings, the top six teams would be selected to compete in a single elimination tournament taking place on the subsequent day. <p> Tentative Rules and Regulations  These are tentative suggestions for the rules and regulations of the competition and are entirely open to suggestions for changes. <p> 1.	For the purpose of this challenge and rule set, a robot is defined as all mechanical and electrical components provided by a team in order to compete in the challenge successfully.  This includes, but is not limited to: motors, batteries, computers, decorations, required safety switches, and items that do not remain attached for the entire challenge 2.	Competitors may not use any off-board systems to track the Orbital Sample (OS) 3.	Competitors must obtain a specified parking orbit before the OS is launched. 4.	Competitors must mount a standard competition regulation package to their robot, which will monitor competitor position, speed, and acceleration.  Competitors robots are required to demonstrate immediate shutdown response to an E-STOP signal and movement start response to a GO signal from the supplied package. 5.	Robot may not exceed 50 kg. 6.	Robot may not exceed 1m width  1m length  1m height in its starting configuration 7.	Robot may extend its workspace beyond the starting configuration size limits by 1m in the height direction and 1m either in the forward or backward direction. 8.	The OS consists of a 10cm diameter x 10cm tall cylinder, weighing 150g. 9.	Robots OS-capturing device may not exceed 30cm in diameter 10.	Robots speed must remain between +/- 0.5 m/s of the OS Bots speed once initial parking orbit is established.  Robots must always move counter clockwise. 11.	Robot may not employ any technology not applicable to space rendezvous/capture operations such as: a.	Sensors that rely on magnetic fields (including the earths magnetic field) b.	Ultrasonic or other sound-based sensors c.	Earth-based or earth orbit-based radio aids (e.g., GPS, VOR, cell phone, etc.) d.	Non-conforming communications/operations protocols 12.	Hazardous materials that pose a threat to teams, spectators, event officials, and the environment are disallowed. 13.	Robots must be built robustly, and be able to withstand competition stresses. 14.	Teams and their robot may not interfere with another competitor robot during any part of the competition.  Actions that intend to delay or disable competitor robots will immediately disqualify offending team. <p> Awards <p> NASA suggests offering the following prizes: <p> 	Level 1 Qualifying: Potential $20k prize purse 	Level 1 Head to Head: Potential $150k prize purse shared by top three teams 	Level 2 Qualifying: Potential $20k prize purse 	Level 2 Head to Head: Potential $500k prize purse shared by top three teams <p> V.	INFORMATION SOUGHT <p> Responses should be submitted in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format and are limited to five (5) pages in length.  Responses should include (as applicable): name, address, email address, and phone number of the respondent, business, or organization, with point of contact for business or organization. <p> Feedback is sought from the public on the following aspects of the Challenge: <p> Conceptual Design of the Competition a)	General interest in competing 	Are you interested and would you participate in this Challenge?  If no, then what would make this challenge more appealing to you? 	Do you have suggestions to make the challenge/competitions more exciting?  b)	Areas for technology development 	Does this challenge incentivize technology development, or does it simply put a new spin on current, or nearly current, technology? 	Are there ways the competition could be changed to encourage more technology development? c)	Competition awards 	Would you compete for the current set of proposed awards? 	If you answered no to the above question, what award levels would incentivize participation? d)	Competition structure (phases, milestones, qualifying events) 	Do you think the levels and phases are appropriate?  If not, how should they be changed? 	Roughly how much time would you require to successfully meet phase objectives? 	 Is the competition format (head-to-head) suitable for this challenge? 	Do you have suggestions for additional qualitative or quantitative metrics for scoring competitors, besides the binary metric of successful capture or not? e)	Competition name 	Other than Space RACE, do you have another name suggestion for this competition? <p> Technical Design of the Competition a)	Competition rules and guidelines 	Are any of the rules unclear, and if so, which one(s)? 	Do the rules contain any unnecessary information or make competition impossible? 	Should there be additional rules to be sure the competition is fair? b)	Starting configuration of competitors and OS Bot 	Do the parking orbit configurations make sense?  Do you have suggestions for an angular reference to hold the parking orbit? 	Do the starting configurations give an advantage to one competitor over the other that has not been addressed? 	Do you have alternative ideas for more fair or more exciting starting configurations? c)	Competitor regulation package 	Does the proposed regulation package seem reasonable to you (speed, acceleration, power)? Do you have a preferred interface to this package? 	Do you have suggestions for how the above quantities should be measured and regulated? 	Are there any other aspects of the competitors vehicles that should be monitored? d)	OS design 	Does the proposed cylindrical design make sense to you?  Will it be possible to grasp a cylindrical OS that is rotating asymmetrically? 	Do the proposed fiducials make sense?  If not, what pattern/features would you propose? 	Do you foresee any issues with the magnetic mount? If so, how should it be changed? e)	Track design 	Does a flat, circular track make sense, or are there other configurations that might be better? Would the competition gain a lot from being held on an inclined track? f)	Earth Return Vehicle design 	What shape and orientation should the provided ERV take? 	Is it reasonable to expect competitors to be able to control orientation of the OS while inserting it into their ERV?  If yes, to what degree should competitors be expected to control orientation? <p> VI.	ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE <p> In the event that NASA does initiate this challenge, NASA will post a public notice in the Federal Register.  At that time, all individuals or entities that wish to participate in the challenge must register as members of a team and enter into an agreement with the designated challenge management organization.  No teams that include foreign nationals, who are not permanent residents of the United States, will be eligible to win prize money.	The sole exception is for U.S. based educational institutions, which may have up to 50% foreign national students on their teams.  No team members may be from countries listed on the NASA list of designated countries the current list of designated countries can be found at <A HREF="http://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/nasaecp/">http://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/nasaecp/ </A>	. <p> Teams cannot include any Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employer.  This includes any U.S. Government organization or organization principally or substantially funded by the Federal Government, including Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, Government-owned, contractor operated (GOCO) facilities, and University Affiliated Research Centers. <p> NASA and other federal agencies may work with and provide technical support to participating teams, as long as it is done on an equitable basis.  That is, similar requests are dealt with in a similar fashion, be it access to facilities, testing, scientific consultation, or other services.  This does not obligate NASA or other federal agencies to provide the support.  These services may be at no cost, or on a cost reimbursable basis as determined by the subject federal agency in accordance with law and policy. <p> Registration and participation in a challenge does not entitle a participant to a NASA-funded prize.  To be eligible to win a NASA-funded prize, the competitor must 1) register and comply with requirements as stated in the competition rules, and enter into a team agreement; 2) in the case of a private entity, be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating alone or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; and 3) not be a Federal entity or a Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. <p> VII.

<DESC>On January 15, 2015, the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration (DHS/TSA) held a DHS Explosive Trace Detection Strategic Sourcing Ordering Vehicle (ETD-3) industry day. At that event, it was noted that a Request for Information (RFI) would be posted to present questions to industry regarding the capability for an Illicit Drugs Handheld ETD system. It is expected that the Illicit Drugs Handheld ETD system will be solicited under Track 2.
<p>For a review of the Acquisition Strategy Industry Day slides and more information regarding Track 2, please see Announcement TSA_ETD3_Industry_Day_2015 provided at the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=008b00ca217c7618dca59b71ed2dfba7&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=008b00ca217c7618dca59b71ed2dfba7&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />As indicated within the Acquisition Strategy Industry Day slides, the DHS intends to solicit a handheld ETD that will be used primarily for screening for illicit drugs, with a secondary ability to allow for the screening of explosives. The system must be designed to be easily transportable (light and can be carried on a person for an entire eight hour shift) and have the ability to function properly on battery power. This system should be hardened and have the ability to deal with a variety of environmental conditions and to survive drops. In an effort to collaborate and engage with stakeholders early to help improve and aid in the development of the Illicit Drugs Handheld ETD requirements, the DHS is presenting the questions&nbsp;within the attached RFI document&nbsp;and seeking industry's response.</p>
<p>Written responses shall be submitted no later than Tuesday March 3, 2015 at 2:00pm Eastern Time to Ms. Sophia Woodward (Sophia.Woodward@tsa.dhs.gov) and Ms. Robyn Peters (Robyn.Peters@tsa.dhs.gov).</p>

<DESC>Introduction:
The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the requirements to provide VistA Imaging Systems and Services.  See attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) titled "Draft PWS - VistA Imaging Tier I".  

This request is a RFI only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bids, Request for Quotations, or a Request for Proposal. Do not submit a proposal or quote.  This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI. You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  

The contract period of performance is anticipated to be three years. The Government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Task Order (SATO) contract with Individual Task Orders to be issued on a performance-based Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.  The forecasted award is anticipated for 2nd quarter fiscal year 2015. 

The VistA Imaging System is a VA developed Picture Archive and Communications System and is the mandated record for all medical image storage across the enterprise.  There are approximately 143 VistA Imaging facilities including numerous VA Medical Centers, VA Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) data centers, and Regional Data Processing Centers throughout the United States, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico and Manila, Philippines.  The Government anticipates acquisition of VistA Imaging Hardware, Software and Services to refresh VistA Imaging installations throughout the enterprise.  Among other hardware, software, engineering, maintenance, sustainment and logistic services, this requirement will replace Tier 1 Vista Imaging systems across the enterprise including:
"	Tier I VistA Imaging Storage Systems
"	Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Gateways
"	Encrypted Tape Libraries - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Compliant
"	Laurel Bridge DICOM Image Routers
"	Background Processors 

The Government is seeking capability statements for the Vista Imaging Systems and Services being sought in the attached draft PWS.  Please be advised: the Vista Imaging System is certified as Class I exempt 510K medical device in accordance with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Part 820, and other Federal legislation.  If the Government pursues a solicitation, a requirement shall be included in the solicitation that any proposed solution shall be on the VA Vista Imaging Approved Configuration List maintained by the VA Vista Imaging Program Office at the time of proposal submission.  Proposal submission is anticipated December 2014 timeframe.  Please indicate in your response if your platform configuration solution is presently on the VA Vista Imaging Approved Configuration List.

In addition, in order to promote competition, potential vendors now have the opportunity to submit a system configuration for certification and testing to the VistA Imaging Qualification Lab (IQL). Any candidate system must meet the functional requirements in PWS attachments A through D to be scheduled for Certification and Testing.  As a result, if a vendor desires to submit a system configuration for certification and testing then please indicate how your company's platform configuration solution meets the functional requirements listed in PWS attachments A through D. 

It must be noted by prospective vendors that ALL costs associated with VistA Imaging Certification and Testing including but not limited to: shipping to/from the IQL, equipment setup/breakdown,  operating personnel, travel, necessary changes, modifications or repairs are to be borne by the Contractor.

<SUBJECT>LHA 8 Original Equipment Manufacturer Suppliers of Government Furnished Equipment Workshop
<SOLNBR>N00024-15-R-2437
<CONTACT>Erin Anderson, Email erin.anderson1@navy.mil
<DESC><p>This Special Notice is for the purpose of announcing that Program Executive Office, Ships (PMS 377) intends to host workshops for LHA 8 Amphibious Assault Ship prospective Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Suppliers of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in Washington, D.C. starting on March 16, 2015 and ending on March 19, 2015.<br /><br />Background:</p>
<p>The LHA Replacement (LHA(R)) ships will recapitalize the aging "large deck" amphibious ships by replacing the Tarawa class. LHA(R) ships are a modified version of the Wasp (LHD 1) class, optimized for aviation and capable of supporting current and future aircraft, such as the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).</p>
<p>Large deck amphibious ships facilitate forward presence and power projection as an integral part of joint, interagency, and multinational maritime expeditionary forces. The ships support the Marine Corps tenets of Operational Maneuver from the Sea (OMFTS) and Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) and the Navy tenets of Sea Strike and Sea Basing.</p>
<p>LHA 8 will be the next increment of the LHA(R) ships following the America Class design with LHA 6/7 hull and machinery. It will incorporate a hybrid well deck designed for two LCAC spots, a smaller island superstructure, and updated warfare and communications systems.</p>
<p>The Navy is currently executing an Affordability Design Effort for LHA 8 for the purpose of driving out ship procurement costs that are incurred by overstated specifications, specifications that have not been updated to reflect current industry practices, Government to contractor miscommunication, old processes, and changes to available materials. The Navy has engaged General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated, Ingalls Shipbuilding in the LHA 8 Affordability Design, in which each shipbuilder has the opportunity to propose design changes to reduce the acquisition cost of the ship while maintaining full design integrity.</p>
<p>OEM Suppliers of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Workshops Information:</p>
<p>The OEM Suppliers of GFE Workshops will provide a platform to introduce the LHA 8 Program to potential OEM suppliers of GFE, to communicate the Affordability Design Effort, and to conduct technical discussions on GFE Cost Reduction Initiatives (CRIs). Dedicated meetings between the Navy and individual OEM suppliers of GFE will provide a mechanism for OEMs to present CRIs to the Navy, to answer technical questions about the CRI, and to contribute to an open dialogue regarding the proposed CRIs. These workshops can serve as a venue for OEMs to discuss any issues with system requirements and/or specifications and to propose solutions to those issues that would be cost benefits to both the OEM and the Navy. Additional information about the structure of the workshops will be provided with registration confirmations.</p>
<p>The LHA 8 OEM Suppliers of GFE Workshops will be held at Alion Science and Technology, 1100 New Jersey Ave SE Suite 200, Washington, DC 20003. There will also be an option for OEM Suppliers of GFE Workshops to be held via teleconference. Below are tentative time slots for the workshops:</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 1: <br />Date: Monday, March 16, 2015<br />Time: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM EST<br /><br />GFE SW Slot 2: <br />Date: Monday, March 16, 2015<br />Time: 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 3: <br />Date: Monday, March 16, 2015<br />Time: 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 4: <br />Date: Monday, March 16, 2015<br />Time: 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 5: <br />Date: Tuesday, March 17, 2015<br />Time: 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 6: <br />Date: Thursday, March 19, 2015<br />Time: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 7: <br />Date: Thursday, March 19, 2015<br />Time: 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 8: <br />Date: Thursday, March 19, 2015<br />Time: 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM EST</p>
<p>GFE SW Slot 9: <br />Date: Thursday, March 19, 2015<br />Time: 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM EST</p>
<p>While the OEM Suppliers of GFE Workshops are open to all potential OEMs for LHA 8, the technical sessions and CRIs should focus on the below targeted systems. These systems are subject to change and will be finalized after registration closes:</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The government would like to hold a site visit so all competing vendors have a chance to see exactly what the upgrade entails. The site visit will be at Building 606 Thayer Road, West Point, NY on Tuesday (2/24/2015) at 1000. If you have any questions with the location or would like to RSVP, contact contract specialist Manuel Medeiros at Manuel.Medeiros@usma.edu or 845-938-3120. This site visit is not mandatory but it is highly recommended.  <br>  <br> The primary purpose of this upgrade is to add three-way High Definition (HD) Video TeleConference (VTC) capability: commercial VTC on a dedicated computer that is also capable of conferencing through the existing USMA VTC conference bridge infrastructure. The VTC will have an HD (digital) camera. Given the distance between the camera and the equipment rack, a camera cable extension solution for video and control is required.  <br>  <br> Commercial WiFi installed to provide visitors with web capability.  <br>  <br> DAD Backdrop (hideable/retracting) behind presenter's area.  <br>  <br> Rewire existing network switches under tables to conform to the new VTC addition.  <br>  <br> Additional Extron AV trac.  <br>  <br> Cabling to secure existing projectors.  <br>  <br> Mobile Crestron control panel.  <br>  <br> If technically possible, provide capability for two Laptops on the table to project to these existing projectors simultaneously.  <br>  <br> The camera and all microphones must be directly available to all VTC/ATC systems.  <br> Environmental vibration mitigated for both existing projectors.  <br>  <br> The upgraded system should support wireless devices, including IPADs, IPhones, androids, and other similar devices for presentations and for sharing content during VTCs.  <br>  <br> The upgraded system should include an automated camera backdrop system that includes the USMA logo to present the highest quality and highest impact video impression.  <br>  <br> We would like an additional control to be added with an IPAD and docking station recharger that can be used without removing the protective sleeve. <br>  <br>

STATEMENT OF WORK
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE SERVICE

SCOPE

Bureau of Indian Affairs, Special Education, and Cooperative Agreement Unit (CAU) is in need of a contractor to provide Speech and Language Pathology services for re-evaluations and new evaluations to begin on the date of award and ending June 30, 2015.

       The contractor will work directly with BIE-funded schools to initiate and evaluation or a re-evaluation for students who are being referred for speech/language services.  All required consents for evaluations will be completed by the referring school.  The evaluator will conduct screening and in-depth assessment in the area of speech pathology including articulation, voice, stuttering, oral language, cleft palate, speech, and auditory needs.  Provide a written and in-depth assessment report with recommendations to the school.  Attend multi-disciplinary team meeting for the students evaluated to provide interpretation of the findings and recommendation to the schools.

	The role of a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) is to access and provide appropriate speech-language services in all grade levels with no school level underserved.  The speech-language pathologist will treat speech language and communication problems in a school setting for all students who qualify to enable them to communicate to the best of their ability.  Using specialized skill, the SLP will work directly with the student and provide support to them to further their academic growth.  Also, the SLP will work closely with teachers of the student; other related services staff and other necessary health professionals.
	The SLP personnel are required to be certified and/or licensed in the State of New Mexico.  They are also required to be fingerprinted and have a background check approved by the Bureau.

The school considers the factors listed below to be essential in implementing these roles and responsibilities:

	Serving a Range of Disorders  As delineated in federal regulations under IDEA, a SLP works with students exhibiting the full range of communication disorders, including those involving language, articulation (speech sound disorders), fluency, voice/resonance, swallowing, and vocational needs that have an impact on attainment of educational goals.

	Ensuring Educational Relevance  The litmus test for role assumed by SLPs with students with disabilities is whether the disorder has an impact on the education of students.

	Provide Culturally Competent Services  SLPs will make important contributions to ensure that all students receive quality and culturally competent services.  The SLPs have expertise to distinguish a language disorder that might include cultural and linguistic differences, socioeconomic factors, lack of adequate prior instruction, and the process of acquiring the dialect of English used in the schools.  This expertise leads to more accurate and appropriate identification of students needs.  SLPs can also address the impact of language differences and second language acquisition on student learning and provide assistance to teacher in promoting education growth.

Range of Primary Responsibilities:  SLPs help students meet the performance/common core standards of a particular school and state.

	Intervention  SLPs will provide intervention that is appropriate to the age and learning needs of each individual student and is selected through an evidence-based decision-making process.  Although service delivery models are typically more diverse in the school setting than in other setting, the therapy techniques are clinical in nature when dealing with students with disabilities.

	Data Collection and Analysis  SLPs are accountable for student outcome.  Therefore, the SLPs, data-based decision making, including gathering and interpreting data with individual students, as well as overall program evaluation are essential responsibilities.

	Compliance  SLP is responsible for meeting federal and state mandates as well as local policies in performance of their duties.  Activities may include Individualized Education Plan (IEP) development, report writing and maintain consultation logs and therapy logs.  Provide a monthly schedule of school visits and schedule according to the school calendar.

	Evaluations and Assessments  The SLPs will independently evaluate students referred to determine the nature and extent of speech or language impairment.  They will select, administer and interpret diagnostic tests to evaluate nonverbal abilities, speech levels, articular errors, and language abilities.  Additionally, complete initial evaluations and re-evaluation reports per school procedures.

Collaboration:  SLPs will work in partnership and work with others to meeting students need.

	SLPs will work closely with reading specialist, literacy coaches, special education teacher, teachers, occupational therapists, school psychologists, audiologists, guidance counselors, and social workers, in addition to others.

	With families; SLPs will work with students of all ages and engage families in planning, decision-making and program implementation with are very essential for parental and family involvement.

	With Students; SLPs will actively engage students in goal planning, intervention, implementation, monitoring their progress and self-advocacy appropriate to age and ability level.

Leadership:  SLPs will provide direction in defining their roles and responsibilities and ensuring delivery of appropriate services to students with disabilities.

	Advocacy; SLPs will/must advocate for appropriate programs and serve for students, including reasonable workloads, and help secure other program supports.  They also must work to influence the development and interpretation of laws, regulations, and policies to promote best practices.

	Parent Training; SLPs will provide training to parents of students of all ages with regard to communication development and disorders.  They may be especially helpful to families in creating a language literacy rich environment.

	Other factors:
	Reasonable Workloads  SLPs must have reasonable workloads.  Therefore, school and SLPs must make ethical and judicious decisions, consistent with legal mandates about the services they provide.  They must balance their scope of work to use their expertise most effectively and efficiently.
	Professional Preparation; SLPs must be fully prepared to meet the needs of the students with disabilities including the range and complexity of student problems require at a minimum well-prepared, masters level professional with a strong knowledge base in speech/language literacy development and speech/language disorders as well as skill set in diagnosis, intervention and workload management at the pre-service level.
	Compensatory Service Time; SLPs will be required to provide compensatory time for services that have been overlooked due to personnel changes and student absence for health and other major family incidences.

<DESC>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) is planning for the acquisition of engineering services for the Advanced Technology Support Program IV (ATSP4), which will be the next in a highly successful series of engineering services Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The ATSP4 program has two solicitations; one is a 100% Small Business Set-aside (HQ0727-15-R-0002) and the other is a Full and Open Competition (HQ0727-15-R-0001). The purpose of this announcement is to provide the official solicitations. DMEA has established a web site located at: http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss, where an executive summary, notional schedule, Virtual Industry Day Q&amp;A, Draft RFP Q&amp;A, and official solicitations are posted. Other than the official solicitations (HQ0727-15-R-0001 and HQ0727-15-R-0002), posted information is for informational use only, is non-binding, and is subject to change. <br /><br />The ATSP4 solicitations are available for download at the following URL:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss">http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss</a><br /><br />ATSP4 is a uniform technical and management approach that leverages advanced technologies to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) for a quick reaction capability across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This capability includes the development of appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate sophistication level, or meet new threats. These efforts may include developing components to meet the DoD's requirements for ultra-low volumes, extending component availability, or ensuring a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics; also included will be the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements to DoD weapon systems in response to traditional and irregular (asymmetric) threats and to the problems related to aging weapon systems. Increasing warfighter capabilities and providing solutions to electronics support problems-such as, reliability, maintainability and obsolescence-are accomplished through the development and insertion of applications of advanced microelectronics technologies. The scope of ATSP4 covers both hardware and software and includes studies, analysis, design, software, simulation, prototyping, integration, testing, producibility, and limited production. The scope of ATSP4 also includes the development of viable methods and procedures for using available tools and resources, strategies for resolution of replacement alternatives, and technical interchange in support of task accomplishment. <br /><br />Source Selection methodologies will be utilized which anticipates multiple awards for these indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contracts. DMEA anticipates making 6 - 10 awards for each of the two acquisitions, the Small Business Set-aside and the Full and Open Competition. <br /><br />In support of the Department of Defense paperless initiatives, all communications regarding this acquisition will be electronic.

<p>&bull; Arrangements for preventive immunizations and detection and control of communicable diseases as specified in PRH-6 and the Immunization and Communicable Disease Control TAG.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

__________________________________________

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov. From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules. The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 2/17/15.

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn. Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices.

Certification for Energy Star can be obtained through the website at www.energystar.gov.

Product designation process for FEMP can be found at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep_fempdesignatedproducts.html. The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the Energy Star, FEMP or EPA website. Dealers using their own part numbers must also list the corresponding manufacturer part number. To determine if you are submitting items that are listed in one of the luminaries specifications for items offered under SIN 206 4 please go to http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires and review the ENERGY STAR Luminaries V1.0 Final Specification document. The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. Paper offers will no longer be accepted for this schedule. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 56 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.

A.	Contractor shall be liable to the Government for losses of production due to significant equipment downtime.  Significant equipment downtime is that which exceeds ten (10) hours/month.  Records regarding downtime will be kept by the COR and the maintenance contractor.

B.	Equipment downtime is calculated only from those normal hours of coverage (see Hours of Coverage Section) that the scheduled equipment is not fully operational.  Downtime will begin when the Contractor is required to be on site (see Unscheduled Maintenance Section response time definition) after notification by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  This does not include scheduled maintenance for PM purposes or when waiting for VA furnished tubes.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.

C.	If downtime exceeds [sixteen (16)] consecutive hours, the CO may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the CO.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with Default clause.

D.	Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the Contractor fails to meet the up-time requirements using the following formula:

MONTHLY			     MONTHS
DOWNTIME

10 - 11 hours/month			0%

12 - 13 hours/month			20%

14 - 15 hours/month			40%

16 - 17 hours/month			60%

18 - 19 hours/month			80%

20 or more hours/month			100%

    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-

<DESC>Background/Introduction: 
As part of the ONR funded ESTEP (Energy Systems Technology Evaluation Program) a heating system with thermal storage is being setup. The ESTEP program is designed to implement technologies that have the capability of reducing Navy and wider DoD facilities energy costs.

The system is designed to match demand with available renewable supply and store the excess heating in a thermal storage system for use later. The technology that will be investigated uses solid inert materials rather than liquids as they are potentially simpler to use.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION:
Questions regarding the solicitation shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM PST 24 February 2015, and the quote shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM PST 27 February 2015, should be marked with solicitation number N6227115Q1100 and shall be valid for 60 days.

<DESC>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic seeks to strengthen the legitimacy, effectiveness, and accountability of Local Self Governments (LSGs) in the Kyrgyz Republic. Assistance will focus on identifying the most significant legitimacy-effectiveness gaps facing LSG bodies, and improving their ability to execute the devolved functions enumerated by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government. This purpose will be accomplished by starting with the community's perceived needs, supporting LSGs to address those expectations within the available resources, and by continuing to provide assistance to further improve each LSG's competency and capacity through mechanisms that can and will function independent of future USAID funding.
<p>The successful offeror will:<br />&bull; With local stakeholders, collaboratively develop a local governance performance assessment methodology that captures key LSG effectiveness and legitimacy measures with respect to devolved functions, and identifies priority LSGs where assistance can feasibly demonstrate timely, effective, and sustained results;<br />&bull; Develop flexible and adaptive Local Self Government assistance products and services; and, <br />&bull; Ensure that the mechanism for delivering these products and services can provide continuing assistance to LSGs, independent of future USAID funding.</p>
<p>These activities will achieve the following results:<br />&bull; Improved LSG effectiveness, as defined by improved competency, capacity and solutions to perform devolved functions and services;<br />&bull; Increased LSG legitimacy, as defined by improved community engagement, responsiveness, and accountability with respect to devolved functions and services; and, <br />&bull; Sustainable mechanism(s) for providing continued flexible, responsive assistance to the needs of LSGs</p>
<p>Throughout this document, the terms Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (&#1087;&#1088;&#1072;&#1074;&#1080;&#1090;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;) and GoKR denote the unitary state - president, prime minister, parliamentarians, ministers, ministries, oblasts, and raions; the terms Local Self Government and LSG denote the Ayil Okmotus (AOs) and cities that are outside the unitary state. The population of the AOs range from 3,000 to 30,000 with a wide range of capacity, competency, economic vitality, and economic resources; the ten largest cities have populations from 30,000 to 800,000.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Country Context<br />The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous country with a population of roughly 5.5 million located in the heart of Central Asia. This small, landlocked, former Soviet state features a nascent democracy, a vibrant and increasingly influential civil society, and robust cooperation with the U.S. on a number of issues. The past ten years have been marked by successive political revolutions and occasional bursts of ethnic violence. Following the ouster of the authoritarian president in April 2010, a new constitution established the Kyrgyz Republic as a parliamentary democracy. Since then, it is successfully passing through its transition phase to become a consolidated democracy that can stand as a positive model among its less progressive neighbors. The Kyrgyz Republic's considerable physical, educational, medical, and social service infrastructure is the legacy of Soviet subsidy and investment, but over two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, these systems are crumbling and suffering from overuse, neglect, and low human capital.</p>
<p>USAID's assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic builds on the Government's commitment to further reform and relatively strong recent economic growth in order to develop a democratic, well-governed, and prosperous Kyrgyz Republic. This is based on the hypothesis that if government institutions' relationship with the citizenry is characterized by increasing accountability and inclusiveness, then its main &lsquo;deliverables' - service delivery and policy - will improve across all socio-economic development sectors, thus increasing the legitimacy and stability of this nascent democracy.</p>
<p>This theory of change reflects the significant democratic gains that the country has made in the past few years, as well as the remarkable vibrancy of its civil society through periods of renewed authoritarianism. The parliamentary democracy established by the 2010 constitution has developed strong foundations, and has proved resilient through repeated collapse (and re-formation) of the governing coalition. However, the Kyrgyz's Republic's democratic future is by no means assured. It continues to suffer from the paradoxical ailment of being simultaneously over-governed and inefficiently governed, inheriting an oversized four-layer government based on the old Soviet model of unitary, top-down hierarchical control by officials who have mostly been appointed from above.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that the Soviet legacy has been a strong countervailing force to decentralization throughout the past twenty years, with centralized ministries largely dominating the decision-making in many critical areas of service delivery (education, health, energy, police, documents and civil registration, etc.), regardless of who gets to be the "mayor" and how s/he gets selected. Despite twenty years of tinkering, there is a gap between expectations and authority at the local level.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic was ranked 125 of 187 countries with a score of 0.622 on the UN Human Development Index. Many services of critical importance to the population (police, schools, health care, civic documents) are technically beyond the jurisdiction of now democratically-elected local officials and are managed by appointed and largely unaccountable representatives of central ministries and agencies. Local elections have made municipal and rural officials answerable to their population, regardless of whether they have the means to solve problems. The Soviet legacy has been a strong countervailing force to decentralization throughout the past twenty years, with centralized ministries largely dominating the decision-making in many critical areas of service delivery, regardless of who is elected or appointed locally.</p>
<p>Decentralization<br />The advancement of reforms that result in sustainable, effective governance by improving accountability and inclusivity is a fundamental USAID decentralization principle. On paper, the Kyrgyz Republic has pushed decentralization further than any other Central Asian country, with political power, representation and fiscal authorities devolved down to local government units. Unfortunately, decentralization in the Kyrgyz Republic remains only half-finished, which undermines long-term attempts to improve governance in the country. The Kyrgyz Republic lacks a consensus vision of what this division of labor should be and how to manage the contraction of the state. The current decentralization program fails to clearly delineate how diverse, weak LSGs can and should implement the significantly devolved service provision model enumerated by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government.</p>
<p>The 2010 Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government (amended 2012, 2014) enumerates 23 devolved functions that are outside the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic:<br />1. Ensuring the economic development of the respective territory<br />2. Managing municipal property<br />3. Forming, confirming and implementation of the local budget<br />4. Providing drinking water to the population<br />5. Ensuring the work of communal sewage systems and sewage treatment facilities<br />6. Ensuring the functioning of municipal roads<br />7. Organizing electrical lighting of communal places<br />8. Maintaining cemeteries and funeral services <br />9. Landscaping and public green spaces <br />10. Maintaining parks, sport and leisure places<br />11. Organization of collection, removal and recycling of waste<br />12. Ensuring the functioning of municipal transport and regulation of public transport work within the respective territory<br />13. Protection of cultural and historic heritage (sites of significance)<br />14. Ensuring and organizing the work of local libraries<br />15. Establishing the rules of land use and enforcement of the rules and regulations of city planning and architecture<br />16. Deciding on the placing of advertisements in accordance with law<br />17. Assistance in maintaining public order<br />18. Creating conditions for developing public arts and culture<br />19. Creating conditions for leisure activities<br />20. Organizing activities with children and youth<br />21. Ensuring conditions for developing physical culture and sport<br />22. Assistance in prevention and mitigating impact of emergency situations<br />23. Exercise authority in the sphere of subsoil use, within the jurisdiction of local government</p>
<p>The 23 devolved functions enumerated in the Law touch on almost all governance activities in a community. Most functions require specialized technical skills; many require significant capital resources. Unfortunately, legislators failed to fully harmonize the draft law with existing legislation, or to clean other laws sector laws of other responsibilities previously delegated to local government bodies. This has led to a confusing legal basis for those attempting to implement the law in the executive branch. The current decentralization program furthermore fails to clearly delineate how local government units are to transition from their current service provision model to the one mandated by legislation. Given that there are no clear, funded, statutorily-consistent GoKR devolution mechanisms in place the challenge is to identify a LSG's most significant legitimacy-effectiveness gaps and then support it in working with its constituents to address those gaps within the community's resources.</p>
<p>In practice since 2010 there has also been a clear divide between larger cities that have been able to take some advantage of these provisions and of the political weakness of the central government and smaller cities, towns and rural Ayil Okmotus (AOs) that have not been able to carry out their basic "local" functions, much less take on the more difficult delegated "State" functions. Osh Mayor Melis Myrzakmatov effectively bargained for a very high level of autonomy from the Provisional Government in 2010 in exchange for his refusal to support the fleeing President Bakiyev and his agents. For local leaders in much of the rest of the country, however, the story is largely one of neglect at best and predation at worst.</p>
<p>Focus groups data since 2012 has shown that unlike general cynicism towards the role of the President and Parliament, there are higher expectations for sub-national government structures: respondents seem to universally expect a number of perhaps more superficial services from local government, including keeping general order in their towns and cities, making sure the street lights stay on, that beautification efforts are ongoing, among others. Respondents also seem to expect a certain level of democratic openness and accountability, often commenting that citizens requests be heard, even if they cannot always be addressed.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />In a 2013 public opinion survey, conducted by the Centre of Study of Public Opinion, citizens were moderately satisfied with the efforts of their LSG. Fifty-seven percent of rural residents were satisfied with their AO's efforts, and only 3% had no opinion; while urban residents were less satisfied at 47%, and less knowledgeable of their city's efforts (16% indicating no opinion).</p>
<p>Good Governance<br />Governance is the overall process of governing, which includes the statutory government authority, the community, and a wide-range of local, regional, and national stakeholders. USAID/Kyrgyz Republic is focused on good governance, defined as the interaction between transparent, competent state bodies on one hand and active, informed civil society on the other. By strengthening Local Self Governments, citizens will begin to perceive governance in the Kyrgyz Republic as being more legitimate, effective, and accountable.</p>

<p>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic's Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) for the U.S. fiscal years 2015-2019 builds on the GoKR's commitment to further reform in democracy and the social sectors as well as relatively strong recent economic growth in order to achieve the CDCS goal of assisting in the development of a democratic, well-governed, and prosperous Kyrgyz Republic. This goal is based on the premise that if government institutions' relationship with the citizenry is characterized by increasing accountability and inclusiveness, then its main &lsquo;deliverables' - service delivery and policy - will improve across all socio-economic development sectors, thus increasing the legitimacy and stability of the Kyrgyz Republic's nascent democracy.</p>

<p>In 2013, the Kyrgyz Republic convened a High Level Development Conference to reflect upon the Kyrgyz Republic's transition from post-crisis recovery to sustained development. The Conference found that the Kyrgyz Republic has a unique chance to provide Local Self Governments with the capabilities for strengthening the governance principles of self-sufficiency and improving service delivery efficiency to meet local community needs. It also identified the following areas to support:<br />&bull; Promoting the concept of local self-government<br />&bull; Optimizing the interaction of state authorities and LSG bodies to improve services and enhance the quality of decisions<br />&bull; Development of municipal services<br />&bull; Capacity-building of administrative staff and governing institutions<br />&bull; Development of fiscal decentralization</p>
<p>USAID AND OTHER DONOR ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has a history of cooperation with the Government of Kyrgyz Republic in development of local governance through decentralization and improving housing and communal services.</p>
<p>The Local Government Initiative Program in Kyrgyz Republic, implemented by the Urban Institute from 2004 through 2006, provided decentralization policy support and LSG capacity strengthening on the provision of primary services to satisfy community requirements.</p>
<p>In 2006, USAID continued the Urban Institute's support of LSGs with a three-year Decentralization and Local Government Program that endeavored to:<br />&bull; Broaden democracy and instilled democratic principles throughout the country<br />&bull; Built capacity of LSGs to effectively manage their resources while transparently providing municipal services<br />&bull; Increase responsiveness of LSGs to needs and priorities of their citizens<br />&bull; Improve capacity of LSGs to manage local economic development and created awareness of the role of local initiatives in the country's overall economic development</p>
<p>USAID's Local Transparency and Cooperation Initiative (LTCI) has the dual objectives of improving cooperation and accountability between citizens and LSGs in public services delivery, and increasing transparency and understanding in the extractive industry. The program works with citizens and community leaders to:<br />&bull; Prioritize LSG expenditures to reflect community needs<br />&bull; Mobilize community resources in cooperation with LSGs <br />&bull; Improve citizen access to higher quality public services <br />&bull; Establish greater trust and appreciation between citizens and their government</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) implements programs to drive better delivery of social services and encourage good governance through greater accountability; improving the quality and transparency of scarce public resources; promoting stability and development through improved and more transparent public financial management; and anti-corruption activities.</p>
<p>World Bank supports a peer-to-peer learning initiative to provide opportunities for LSG representatives to discuss problems related to local budgeting and share experiences, problems and tested solutions, as well as for local CSOs to learn to be more effective in demanding transparency and accountability of budget process. Training, practical handbook and open budget hearings, giving citizens and local officials the knowledge and tools to formulate and implement more effective and transparent local budgets. The project also promoted demand for additional budget transparency by raising awareness and strengthening journalists' ability to analyze, present, and disseminate accurate information about fiscal and budgetary problems at the local and national levels. <br /><br />The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) conducted a demonstration project to operationalize good governance in the context of social justice initiatives by improving access to public service delivery and addressing the rights of the most vulnerable elements of three thematic constituency groups in the Kyrgyz Republic: children, women, and youth.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) works to increase the equitable access for citizens to services through transparent and efficient use of public resources by supporting decentralization as a means to improve governance, make political processes more democratic and participative, strengthen local power, and make the state less prone to conflict. SDC has undertaken a Public Service Improvement project to improve the efficiency and quality of the services provided by municipalities to increase quality of life of local communities.</p>
<p>Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) works through the Mountain Societies Development Support Programme. Its primary activities include establishing and building the capacity of community organizations to initiate and manage village development projects. It also introduces improved technology to increase agricultural and livestock productivity; supports income generating activities and small enterprise development; and provides training and support to village organizations.</p>
<p>OSCE Center in Bishkek has five strategic priority areas: strengthening of relations between communities; fostering good governance and combating corruption; fighting against terrorism; promoting human rights protection and the rule of law; and furthering gender equality. Through its Osh field office and an office in Batken an array of conflict-prevention activities are being implemented, in addition to monitoring the inter-ethnic relations in the southern provinces of the country.</p>
<p>ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic seeks to strengthen the legitimacy, effectiveness, and accountability of Local Self Governments (LSGs) in the Kyrgyz Republic. Assistance will focus on identifying the most significant legitimacy-effectiveness gaps facing LSG bodies, and improving their ability to execute the devolved functions enumerated by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government. This purpose will be accomplished by starting with the community's perceived needs, supporting LSGs to address those expectations within the available resources, and by continuing to provide assistance to further improve each LSG's competency and capacity through mechanisms that can and will function independent of future USAID funding.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives and Measures<br />Rather than requiring an activity design based on specified methods of performance, USAID requires offerors to propose technical approaches that best achieve the following performance objectives as defined by each objective's performance measures:</p>
<p>Objective 1 Increasing Local Self Government effectiveness, as defined by improved competency, capacity and solutions to perform devolved functions and services, within a community's resource constraints by:</p>
<p>Measure 1.1 Increasing staff competency and capacity<br />Measure 1.2 Advancing implementable administrative protocols, processes, and procedures <br />Measure 1.2 Advancing financially sustainable, local solutions to better deliver a constituency's priority services<br />Measure 1.4 Advancing readily achievable GoKR reforms to improving LSG's effectiveness</p>
<p>Objective 2 Increasing Local Self Government legitimacy, as defined by improved community engagement, responsiveness, and accountability in the implementation of devolved functions and services, incrementally and sustainably by:<br /><br />Measure 2.1 Strengthening all community stakeholders' engagement in LSG planning and execution<br />Measure 2.2 Reconciling community expectations with LSG resource constraints</p>
<p>Objective 3 Furthering and sustaining indigenous Kyrgyzstani Local Self Government support capabilities that are competent and able to provide on-going assistance to communities and their leadership by:</p>
<p>Measure 3.1 Collaborating and coordinating with multiple stakeholders such as GoKR LSG-oriented entities, emerging LSG consulting firms, LSGs and their communities, and international donors<br />Measure 3.2 Promoting new and existing products, services, and practices that strengthen indigenous Kyrgyzstani LSG technical expertise and assistance capability<br />Measure 3.3 Ensuring a post-activity mechanism for LSG assistance and support, not dependent on USAID funding that fosters and leverages indigenous capabilities to promulgate best practices, products, and services</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Indicators<br />The contractor's performance will be evaluated based on progress in accomplishing the activities specified in their annual work plans and activity monitoring and evaluation plan (AMEP), and achievement of the contract targets for each performance measure set in connection with the indicators provided in this section. USAID and the successful offeror will use objectively verifiable indicators with periodic data collection to measure performance and adjust approaches as necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to custom indicators proposed by the Implementer as part of the activity design, USAID requires that USG indicators and USAID custom indicators be collected as part of this activity:</p>
<p>&bull; USG Standard Indicators<br />o Number of sub-national entities receiving USG assistance that improve their performance</p>
<p>&bull; USAID Custom Activity Indicators<br />o Number of LSGs with improved effectiveness scores, based on LSG Performance Assessment Tool<br />o Number of LSGs with improved legitimacy scores, based on LSG Performance Assessment Tool<br />o Average % increase in LSG effectiveness scores, based on LSG Performance Assessment Tool<br />o Average % increase in LSG legitimacy scores, based on LSG Performance Assessment Tool<br />o Number of Kyrgyzstani LSG advisors and experts with improved capacity<br />o Number of new or improved LSG advisory services and products</p>
<p>USAID CROSS-CUTTING BEST PRACTICES</p>
<p>Local Systems: A Framework for Supporting Sustained Development (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/local-systems-framework) describes USAID's approach to transforming innovations and reforms into sustained development. The Framework defines how to advance aid effectiveness and serves as the basis for deeper collaboration with all partners to support sustainability though local systems.</p>
<p>The focus on local systems is rooted in the reality that achieving and sustaining any development outcome depends on the contributions of multiple and interconnected actors. Building the capacity of a single actor or strengthening a single relationship is insufficient. Rather, the focus must be on the system as a whole: the actors, their interrelationships, and the incentives that guide them. Realizing improved development outcomes emanates from increasing the performance of multiple actors and the effectiveness of their interactions. Sustaining development outcomes depends on the sustainability of the local system - specifically, its built-in durability and adaptability that allows actors and their interrelationships to respond to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>The framework's principles for engaging local systems are:<br />&bull; Recognize there is always a system<br />&bull; Engage local systems everywhere<br />&bull; Capitalize on USAID convening authority<br />&bull; Tap into local knowledge<br />&bull; Map local systems<br />&bull; Design holistically<br />&bull; Ensure accountability<br />&bull; Embed flexibility<br />&bull; Embrace facilitation<br />&bull; Monitor and evaluate for sustainability</p>
<p>The Local Systems Framework incorporates USAID's Learning Agenda on Local Organization Capacity Development (http://usaidlearninglab.org/library/capable-partners-learning-agenda-local-organization-capacity-development), an effort to assist in developing better partnerships with local organizations.</p>
<p>One of its key findings is that training fatigue is widespread. The standard-package capacity development approach is being questioned. Clients want custom-tailored approaches: real-time, problem-related approaches that engage mentors or involve peer-to-peer learning. The preference for these "horizontal" as opposed to "vertical" approaches is growing. The Learning Agenda suggests that development activities need to:<br />&bull; See risk in terms of impact risk rather fiduciary risk<br />&bull; Move to a less idealized and perfectionist view of capacity<br />&bull; Shift to more inductive approaches to research and contextual analysis<br />&bull; Recognize that partnership means changing staff roles to build longer term relationships<br />&bull; Let go of an engineering mind set (tools, kits) in favor of one that embraces process, next steps, iteration</p>
<p>Gender Equality and Female Empowerment<br />Gender is a social construct that refers to relations between and among the sexes, based on their relative roles. USAID's Automated Directive System (ADS) states: "Gender issues are central to the achievement of strategic plans and Development Objectives (DO), and USAID strives to promote gender equality, in which both men and women have equal opportunity to benefit from and contribute to economic, social, cultural, and political development; enjoy socially valued resources and rewards; and realize their human rights". (ADS 201.3.9.3)</p>
<p>Further, USAID requires that gender integration be incorporated into new project designs. Specifically, gender integration entails the identification and subsequent treatment of gender differences and inequalities during program/project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. As part of the design of any proposed activity, the contractor should assess and identify gender issues that affect the participation of men and women equally in the participation of this project. The contractor is expected to examine cultural perceptions, economic barriers, and other factors that affect women and men in terms of local governance. <br />In 2012, UNDP undertook a comprehensive case study on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Public Administration in the Kyrgyz Republic (http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Women-s%20Empowerment/KyrgyzstanFinal%20-%20HiRes.pdf ).The study found that women's movement in Kyrgyzstan, embodied in a network of NGOs, has achieved remarkable success for gender equality and continues to be a driving force. The women's movement started a nationwide advocacy campaign for gender quotas with the result that in 2007, despite resistance from most politicians, a 30 percent gender quota was introduced to the Election Code and Kyrgyzstan subsequently has 22 percent women MPs, as well as two female deputy speakers of the Parliament, four Heads of Parliamentary Committees and six Deputy Heads of committees, as well as one woman Governor of a Local Self Government.</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz Republic also has a relatively robust policy framework in supporting areas, such as a law on sexual harassment and good support for maternity, although there is scope to introduce reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Despite benefiting from higher education levels than men, young women are hampered in their career aspirations by lack of time due to domestic responsibilities, which are even growing under increasingly traditional tendencies and in the face of minimal and unstable social protection. The lack of support and gender stereotyping at home are replicated in the workplace, with even basic legal requirements such as breastfeeding rooms often not in place, and many women are afraid to exercise their maternity rights.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

i.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77 and 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). (b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Exec -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Due to numbering requirements, this number has changed to FA8214-15-R-0001. Interested parties may want to update their notices on FBO.</em></p>
<p>The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Contracting Division, Hill Air Force Base, UT intends to issue a solicitation for Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE) Production effort. The RFSE is a nuclear-certified test set. It is comprised of radio frequency, electrical, and structural hardware (including through-hole soldered multi-layer boards) which is integrated with government-provided, existing, non-commercial software. Under the RFSE production effort, the contractor will:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - produce and deliver up to seven RFSE suites, up to four sets of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; support equipment, and initial spares in accordance with the applicable <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standards and government-provided drawings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - provide interim contractor support for all RFSE units;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - train users on how to operate, test, maintain, troubleshoot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and do field-level repairs the RFSE.<br />Contractors must have the ability to perform design requalification and recertification if circumstances necessitate a change in the nuclear-certified design of the RFSE-such a change would require nuclear surety and nuclear safety experience. Due to the nuclear-certified design, contractors must have a well-defined and detailed manufacturing plan (including environmental controls), stringent configuration control, and a high degree of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Delivery of the first RFSE unit will be made no later than 20 months after contract award, and all RFSE units and support equipment must be delivered no later than 44 months after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will result in issuance of a Definitive Contract with multiple options. Draft parts of the solicitation critical to an offeror's understanding of the requirement have been released on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. This included Section L, Section M, and the model contract (with Contract Line Item Numbering Structure). Interested parties who seek more information on this acquisition (including but not limited to quantity, unit of issue, and destination information) are advised to review that draft release. The draft will be updated upon solicitation release, and offerors are required to review the solicitation for any updates.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition (not a small business set aside), using the lowest price, technically acceptable source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures (effective 1 July 2011) as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 December 2014 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).</p>
<p>The solicitation (except the technical data package-see below) will be released on FBO. Paper copies of the solicitation (except technical orders-see below) will not be mailed. Interested offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation and are encouraged to register for notification through FBO.</p>
<p>While the solicitation will be placed on FBO, the technical data package (TDP) will not. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application, and the TDP contains export controlled data. As such, the only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. Those that are certified and registered will have a DD Form 2345 certified by the Joint Certification Program. For those contractors that do not have a certified DD Form 2345, but would like to participate in this acquisition, the form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at</p>
<p>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that approval of a DD2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form now rather than upon or after release of the solicitation is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the TDP, offerors must request the TDP from the contracting officer listed in the below point of contact section. The request must include a copy of the offeror's current, approved DD Form 2345. Once an offeror's DD Form 2345 is verified, access to the drawings, specifications, and other program documents through the software program, TopVue, will be provided to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. After approval of the controlling office, technical orders will be provided to the data custodian by mail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not permitted</span>. All offerors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) to be eligible for award. In addition, offerors must ensure their Annual Representations and Certifications are updated and current.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: FA8522&#8208;12-R-31315
<p>This is a notice of intent that the government anticipates issuing a contract for repairs that are required to support the AC-130H/U and MC-130H model aircraft in sustainment of the AN/ALQ-172 Countermeasures System, (NSNs are listed below). The proposed contract action is for repair for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Other Than Full and Open Competition. This acquisition is restricted to EMS Technologies Inc./Honeywell (Cage 5VWN5) because it has the unique data, experience, expertise, equipment, and facilities to satisfy the government's requirements. It is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for these items. The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to contract repair of parts from additional sources. This will be a five year contract consisting of a 12 month basic period and four annual option periods.<br /><br /><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS<br />&nbsp;

<DESC>Industry Questions and Government Answers <br> Worldwide Engineering Services <br> Small Business Capability RFIs 1-16 <br> 17 February 2015 <br>  <br> 1. Are these RFIs related to TEIS? They appear to be the same requirements as TEIS.  <br>  <br> Answer: These RFIs represent preliminary market research. As the RFIs stated, there is currently no requirement for these services.  <br>  <br> 2.

Are there 16 or 19 Sources Sought -Requests for Information (RFI)? <br> Answer: There are 16 work narratives associated with this Request for Information rather than the 19 referenced within paragraph one of each of the 16 Sources Sought notices issued. <br>  <br> ________________________________________________________________________________ <br>  <br> Synopsis:   <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Huachuca Division is issuing this sources sought for information and planning purposes only. This notice is not a Request for Proposal/Quote or Bid.  This sources sought is a market research tool to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources that will be used for planning purposes and to determine if potential small business sources exist to support the requirement.  This information is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government.  Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.  <br>    <br>  1.  The ACC-APG is trying to determine if a capability exists in the market place for small businesses to provide any one or more of 19 capabilities that have been issued separately.  Request that interested small businesses answer each RFI separately and respond to the specific requirements described in paragraph two (2) of the RFI being responded to. The program's objective is to provide potential contractual vehicle(s) for the Army to provide information systems engineering and information technology support services to United States Army Information Systems Engineering Command (USAISEC) and other federal agencies worldwide. Support may be required around the globe in challenging environments including remote locations, sometimes hostile territories, and highly secure facilities involving the highest level clearances.  <br>    <br>  2.  REQUIREMENT:  Information Systems Integration. Perform information systems integration.  This includes the activities associated with establishing or enhancing the information system (hardware, software, security features, data, operations, and personnel) based upon a governing architecture.  Information systems integration generally is conducted at the systems level.  The nature of the information systems integration process requires a broad, high-level perspective to address:  <br>    <br>  	a. Developing objective and target system architecture and configurations conforming to DoD's most current Architectural Framework.  <br>    <br>  	b. Developing transition plans and strategies for migration of baseline information systems to the target and objective configurations.  <br>    <br>  	c. Developing, updating and maintaining DoD and Army Planning documents.   Evolutionary changes to migration systems shall be governed by conformance to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and shall be maintained:    <br>    <br>  (1)  Within and across the sustaining base, theater/tactical, and strategic information environments;   <br>  (2)  Within geographic areas; and  <br>  (3)  Within commands/organizations/units.	  <br>    <br>  d. Performing assessments of information systems, architectures and networks to insure compliance with system requirements, and guidelines and policies contained in Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and other documents identified in specific tasks.  <br>    <br>  e.

Reviewing and validating proposed and existing system designs.   <br>    <br>  g. Developing capital plant investment strategies that provide a sound, technical foundation for the programmatic plans.  <br>     <br>  3. The government is considering the use of multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  It is anticipated that the effort would be for one base year, extending 12 months from date of award plus two one-year option periods, if exercised.  The anticipated Standard Industrial Code (SIC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) codes for the acquisition are SIC code 7373 (Computer Integrated Systems Design) and NAICS code 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services) with a small business size standard of $25M.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for an airbag system that is capable of meeting the basic requirements described below.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.      <br>        <br> DESCRIPTION:    <br>        <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is seeking a domestic source for energy dissipating airbags, to be used with a specific cargo aerial delivery platform, for test and evaluation.     <br>        <br> The U.S. Army has recently proven the concept of modifying the United Kingdom's Medium Stressed Platform (MSP) to function with U.S. C-130J aircraft.  The platform uses airbags integrated into the structure to dissipate impact energy upon touchdown in lieu of energy dissipating material (EDM, aka honeycomb) currently used by the U.S.  The concept of using airbags instead of honeycomb is believed to benefit the U.S. Army by reducing impact forces to cargo, thus improving cargo survivability.    <br>        <br> REQUIREMENTS:    <br>        <br> The desired airbag design should consist of a cylinder made of impermeable fabric, sandwiched between two mattress boards, with a one-way valve on the bottom and an orifice on the top.  See the attached file 'Airbag Assembly.pdf'  for a picture representing the desired airbag configuration.  The impermeable fabric cylinder shall be collapsible for storage and expandable during deployment.  The cylinder will most likely be reinforced with wire or flexible rod to improve the hoop strength.  The mattress boards shall be made from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch plywood or similar and are attached to the cylinder with ties or other type of replaceable fasteners.  The bottom board shall be furnished with a one-way valve through which the airbag is inflated by ram air during descent, much the same way a parachute is inflated.  The top board shall be furnished with a sacrificial patch that covers the orifice.  Upon platform touchdown, the airbag is compressed, increasing the air pressure, causing the sacrificial patch to burst.  During compression the orifice controls the air flow exiting the cylinder, slowing down the load to the ground.      <br>        <br> The platform to which the airbags will interface is the United Kingdom's (UK) Medium Stressed Platform (MSP).  See the attached file 'MSP Assembly.pdf' for an illustration of the platform. The MSP is constructed of three longitudinal channels (one channel on each side and one center channel) and twenty-three (23) transverse channels.  The top of the transverse channels provide the surface to which the cargo load is secured.  The airbags are located beneath the transverse channels, between the longitudinal channels.  The top mattress boards of the airbags run along the ledges of the longitudinal channels and are tied in place.  The bottom mattress boards are held in place by the platform's skid doors.

<DESC>Revision to Announcement 1. 6:00 PM 02/17/2015.

The correct version of the SOW was uploaded. 

The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)

PLEASE NOTE THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER OF THIS SOLICITION WAS DTFAAC-14-R-04721 AND IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DTFAAC-15-R-02523.

It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $960,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size effort applicable to this requirement:
NAICS:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services
Size Standard:  $15.0 Million

This acquisition is an A&E procurement that is obliged to comply with The Brooks Act (40 USC 1101).  The award process involves the evaluation of architectural and engineering services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at fair and reasonable prices.  The evaluation process will not take price into consideration until the most technically qualified and competent firm is selected.

A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).

The A&E firms submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 

1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence- 

The offeror must provide a specific narrative and supporting documentation that describes the offeror's technical and managerial capabilities in the specialized area of environmental A/E services.  Emphasis will be placed on the Contractors experience, especially on contracts for similar services and magnitude, and the depth and breadth of understanding of the solicited requirement as reflected in the proposal.  It includes an evaluation of example projects (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities in each of the following areas:
	Environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit
	Pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects)
	Environmental Compliance
	Air emissions reporting and evaluation projects
	Asbestos Surveys
	Engineering design and specifications
	Environmental remedial investigation, design, and implementation (CERCLA) performed within the last 10 years. 

Offerors are restricted to no more than 6 example projects completed within 5 years to the proposed effort.

These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort; their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables).  Projects completed for the Federal Government in particular should be included, if any.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating successful completion of at least one project in each of the above areas.  Performance will be evaluated as successful when information submitted by the offeror or from client contact confirms that the projects were effective in meeting the intended primary outcome of the project.  For example, a project intended to achieve permit compliance must demonstrate that compliance was achieved.

2. Past Performance on Similar Contracts-
Past performance shall demonstrate how well the offeror delivers quality services; demonstrates ability to achieve program objectives; meet customer expectations; demonstrates ability to manage and meet priority timelines; demonstrates ability to manage expenses; and demonstrate overall performance on work similar in operational and technical complexity to services described in the SOW. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other available sources in the evaluation of past performance.

Offerors shall provide a narrative for each of the example projects (detailed reviews) provided in Factor 1.  Narratives shall include information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders. Offerors shall provide at least two points of contacts for each project who can account for the conditions, effort, and complexity comparable to this requirement.  Aspects of the projects submitted for past performance should be relevant to the requirement for this contract and recent (within five years) to the proposed effort.  The offeror shall clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating that each project met the budget, quality and schedule objectives for the project.  Offerors are restricted to no more than 3 pages per narrative for each example project.

Offerors shall complete Section 1 of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (SIR Attachment 5) and send it along with the Client Authorization Letter (see sample at SIR Attachment 6) to all points of contact (POCs) for the contracts the Offeror identified in its proposal for this factor (a minimum of three, but no more than five for the prime, and maximum of three for each teaming partner/significant subcontractor for contracts completed or underway within the last five years).   The POCs shall be familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature.  The POCs will complete the questionnaires and forward them by email to the Contracting Officer, Kathleen Islas, (Kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov) no later than the SIR closing date.  RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES SHALL NOT SEND THE COMPLETED INFORMATION SHEETS BACK TO THE OFFEROR.  The Source Evaluation Team (SET) will conduct follow-up with any POC as necessary.

Organizational Structure Change History  Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between the conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, offerors shall include a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the offerors company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), the "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts identified, yet general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

 3. Professional Qualifications 

 Offeror shall submit a complete resume of the experience of each line and staff executive, supervisor and technical staff member who will be assigned to work the requirements of this contract.  Resumes should include: name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Resumes of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is needed.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered professional engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.
execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.

4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work Required 

Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload, i.e., total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, provide examples of completed projects and timetables associated with their completion.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources, or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  Information on teaming or subcontracting that will be done with firms having experience within the locales outside of Oklahoma listed above must be provided.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.  The offerors submission will be deemed satisfactory upon demonstrating that it is clearly able to manage the anticipated workload of this contract.

5. Geographic Location-

Offeror shall submit their geographic location relative to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  

Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.

Primary Electrical Phase 5
VA259-15-R-0061

The intent of VA Project 660-15-102 is to provide additions and modifications the 15kv redundant loop distribution system at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center Campus located in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The project will complete Segment 12 with S&C Switches and Conductors up to and including Switches C14 and D14, enabling 15kV Redundant Loop power to be extended at a later date to the existing Parking Structure Building B.48 and the new Specialty Services Clinics Building B.51 from Switches C14 and D14. The Project will also complete the Inner Redundant Loop by installing the completion of Segments 7C, 7B, 7A, and 7 in their entirety. The installation of duct-bank and manhole infrastructure for the West Outer Redundant Loop will continue with the installation of duct-banks & manholes for Segment 8.    The estimated magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.

The POC for this project will be Andrew Stigen.  He can be contacted at 307-433-3739 or email at Andrew.stigen@va.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Presolicitation Notice is to respond to questions from prospective offerors.
A.  Responses to questions are below:

Q1:  Can a Contractor Performance Report be used in lieu of a CPARS-ACASS Evaluations or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), if a CPARS-ACASS Evaluation or PPQ have not been written on a project?

A1:  The contractor performance report submitted along with this question is a Past Performance Questionnaire.  The Government will accept another agency's report provided the performance information stated mirror's the information requested on the Past Performance Questionnaire for this requirement.

Q2:  In regard to Criterion 1: Will a 100% design complete project that has not been bid be eligible for consideration within the five projects requested?

A2:  Yes.  As stated in Criterion 1, "Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract with regard to:
? Experience with design of similar types of facilities;
? Experience with multi-phased hospital design and construction programs;
? Experience with construction and renovation phasing in hospitals and other VA facilities;
? Experience in providing post construction award services (shop drawing review, as-built drawing and Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) preparation, construction inspection services, and Operating and Maintenance Manuals)."

Q3:  In regard to Criterion 1: Will a study that does not have associated construction qualify for consideration within the five projects requested?

A3: No.

Q4:  In regard to Criterion 4: The solicitation requests PPQs. Are ACASS ratings acceptable in lieu of PPQs?

A4:  As stated in criterion 4, "SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1."

Q5:  In regard to Criterion 4: Our VA COR's are often very busy and we try to be respectful of asking their time on these requests.  If we have past VA PPQ's that our VA CORs for our projects have filled out, can we submit those?

A5:  Yes.  As stated in criterion 4, "the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1."  Criterion 1 states, " Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years." 

Q6:  Will a JV between two SDVSOB firms that are individually verified with the VA CVE be required to have their JV verified through the VA's CVE?

A6:  Yes

B.  All other terms and conditions within the Presolicitation Notice remain unchanged.
