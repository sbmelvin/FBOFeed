<SUBJECT>B -- Evaluate Performance of Air Purifying Respirators (APR) Cartridges for Firefighting Operations

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Arizona to develop and validate appropriate, laboratory test methods for evaluating the performance Air Purifying Respirator (APR) cartridges for firefighting operations.  The University of Arizona will conduct additional research and will use this unique test chamber and method to test additional APR cartridges for different combinations of burning materials.  The purpose of this work is to generate information and data that will be used to establish performance criteria that will be used in the future development of a respirator standard by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Respiratory Technical Committee.  The University of Arizona, under the program and technical management of Dr. Renee Anthony, will employ the testing chamber and test method developed under the previous methods to evaluate the performance of additional APR cartridges for both structural and wildland firefighting operations.

Background and Need 

The NPPTL provides world, national and Institute leadership for prevention and reduction of occupational disease, injury and death for workers who rely on personal protective technologies (PPT) through partnership, research, service, and communication. The NPPTL mission includes the development of performance criteria, certification standards and guidelines relating to the emergency responder protective ensembles. 

Representatives from the University of Arizona, 3M, Phoenix Fire Department, NPPTL and MSHA have been involved in discussions regarding use of the Air Purifying Respirators (APR) for use in fire operations.  APRs would provide an additional respiratory protection option for structural firefighters involved in overhaul operations, as well as wildland firefighters.  Overhaul (non-human) testing could take place in a firefighting training facility, and the Phoenix Fire Department is willing to make their training facility available.

Scope of Work:

NPPTL does not have performance criteria or standards specific to evaluate APRs for use in these types of fire service operations.  A testing chamber and test method was developed to generate smoke at concentrations representative of structural fire overhaul wildland firefighting activities to generate this smoke in a test chamber, and to measure challenge and breakthrough concentrations using two commercially available APR cartridges.  Data from the chamber testing indicated the breakthrough of inhalation hazards such as aldehydes, PAHs, and other contaminants occurred at smoke concentrations less than levels identified in available technical literature.  

This work proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of two additional cartridges for the investigation of structural firefighting.  A third ?tandem? test is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating additional media to reduce breakthrough of identified contaminants, namely aldehydes and PAHs.  In addition, a total of three respirator cartridges will be evaluated for breakthrough tests using representative wildland fire materials.  Wildland material smoke breakthrough testing will be conducted on the best-performing APRs in for the structural material burn tests.  

The technical objectives of the research under this contract are:

1) Determine if any existing APR ?smoke canister? is suitable to prevent the inhalation of contaminants during structural overhaul and wildland firefighting operations.
2) If no commercial canister is found adequate, determine if the addition of a aldehyde filter will prevent contaminate breakthrough. 
 
Detailed Technical Requirements:

The study matrix is given as Table 1.  The results from these additional tests will complete the assessment of whether APR cartridges are effective in structural overhaul firefighting activities.  The cartridges were selected because these manufacturers have  SCBA systems widely used by US firefighters.

Table 1:  Study matrix.  A total of 8 tests will be performed during this phase of the study.  Items in bold are new additions to the overall project evaluation.  Data for future phases is incorporated into the table to illustrate future data
Combustion Source(s)	Scott  642 with P-100	3M

2 completed in phase 1	1
(2 completed in phase 1)	2	2	2
Woodland Materials	Phase III:  2 of best performers in phases I and II, 3 tests each
?Blank?	Phase III: Examine one cartridge for same matrix of chemicals without challenge gas to confirm no contaminants are due to the respirator cartridge itself (randomly select).

The test chamber, smoke generation system, and sampling system from the previous research are in place and ready for additional testing under this contract.  Figure 1 provides a schematic of sampling train used to determine contaminant breakthrough of the test respirator cartridge.  During method development work, 78.15 Lpm passed through the test cartridges in attempts to meet the 85 +/- 4 Lpm specified in 42 CFR 84 for particulate breakthrough studies.  However, particulate breakthrough was insignificant even with high particulate concentrations in the challenge smoke; therefore, this work will reduce the total airflow to 64 Lpm, required for chemical breakthrough studies in the same standard.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A DOWN-SELECT OR QUALIFICATION SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL of any kind.  The applicable NAICS is 611430: Professional Development Training. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any costs incurred that are associated with any submissions received from industry in response to this Market Survey, including travel costs.  All costs associated with this Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬______________________________________________________________________ In order to continue the productive dialogue with potential vendors on the Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS) and to ensure that all potential vendors understand the human talent and capital resources currently utilized at the FAA's Academy, the FAA is inviting all interested vendors to a Visit Opportunity at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK on Saturday, March 3, 2007.   Vendors must express their interest in attending and provide the names of the individuals and a point of contact that will be representing their organizations to the Contracting Officer, at joe.carey@faa.gov no later than noon on February 15, 2007. It should be noted that this will likely be the only remaining opportunity for potential ATCOTS vendors to view the Academy. Vendors may also submit questions regarding the Academy resources, as it relates to the ATCOTS acquisition, prior to the visit, but no later than noon on February 1, 2007.  These questions, as opposed to ATCOTS normal process of responding only to the vendor submitting the query, will be disseminated with their answers publicly, although with identification of the requester removed. Vendors are also encouraged to submit requests with their questions to see or learn about any particular aspects of the Academy including physical space, capital equipment, procedures, etc.  Although the FAA cannot guarantee to accommodate every request, an effort will be made to do so, if deemed legally permissible, especially for those items requested by multiple vendors. The ATCOTS program office had intended to release a draft Statement of Objectives and related documents for industry comment sometime this week.  As the draft documents are still undergoing Agency review, the program office is unable to release them at this time and is targeting January 16, 2007 as the release date.  At that time, the FAA also anticipates releasing information concerning an Industry Day in the Washington, D.C. area.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with The RayBiotech, Inc. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health, Laboratory of Population Genetics. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Soliciting from a single source. Description:  The Government has a requirement for the purchase of Custom Human Antibody Array to support there need for additional testing in their ongoing genomic/proteomic projects related to human cancer.    The goal of the laboratory of Population Genetics is to identify genes and their associated networks that are important in cancer.   Iterative cycles of modeling, genome-wide data generations and bioinformatics analysis are used to translate genetic and genomic observations into insights of cancer etiology.  This system strategy is applied to identify genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma etiology and Breast cancer.  High-throughput studies across multiple research disciplines are required to create useful data sets, from which predictive and or confirming information can be drawn.  Powerful, miniaturized, multiplexed, parallel and automated analysis tools primarily created for genomic DNA micro arrays are being implemented in other application areas and could hole the key to large-scale "omic" analysis.  RayBiotech is modifying their commercially available product to fulfill the National Cancer Institute needs.   The period of performance for this effort is for delivery of product 30 days after date of award. Interested parties must respond by January 3, 2007 no later then 1pm Eastern Time.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-03 Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov; PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 p.m., Arlington, VA local time, February 5, 2007.  POC: Deepak Varshneya, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-03@darpa.mil; 
Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/oneshot/index.htm

The proposers are advised to obtain the Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with BAA 07-03 and take its additional requirements into consideration when formulating their proposals.  The BAA and the PIP together constitute the full BAA for this project.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of Advanced Sighting System (One-Shot) program is to enable Snipers to accurately hit targets with the first round, under crosswind conditions, at the maximum effective range of the weapon (RE).  For this purpose, the system developed must provide a measure of downrange crosswind (wind) and range to target.  This information will then be used to compensate the bullet trajectory to offset crosswind and range related bullet deviations resulting in substantially increased success of kill.  The system must operate over a range of visibilities, atmospheric turbulence and scintillation, and environmental operating conditions and exploit novel technologies that address the overall requirements of this program.  It is anticipated that the ultimate system culminating from this investigation and development will provide performance summarized in Annex to BAA 07-03 (Classified).  The development work will be conducted in two Phases 1 and 2; with Phase 1 objective being "Feasibility Demonstration" while Phase 2 "Packaging of the System". 

It is recognized that crosswind has the effect of deviating the bullet trajectory producing offsets in the hit point.  In some cases, a 10mph wind could produce a miss even at 400 meters while in other cases the deviation could be much worse, exceeding 3 meters at 1200 meters range.  The deviation increases as the wind velocity and/or the engagement range increases.  Current methods to compensate the bullet trajectory, under adverse combat conditions, are inadequate since they require a) a spotter to guide the shooter on target by observing wind velocity and direction, b) determining the hit point deviation from the aim point if the round results in a miss, c) guessing range to target, and d) the user to undergo intense field training. 

Typically for long range shots, it is desirable to profile the downrange wind instead of measuring an average value since wind can change at various points along the range.  If the wind is profiled, it could increase the overall measurement time duration; introducing latency in measurements.  Therefore the system must be able to optimize the required accuracy in a given measurement period and the number of profiled segments over the engagement range.  Clearly, the greater the number of sampling segments, the better the anticipated hit accuracy. Topography, pressure and temperature should therefore be considered in the estimation of the number of profiled wind segments.

Although substantial efforts have been made over the last decade in measuring crosswind, two approaches have been commonly used.  These are, namely a) Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) and b) Coherent Doppler Lidar.  Although these techniques are useful for some applications, they do not seem to be adequate for this application. 

Proposers may consider any potential sensor technology, individually or in combination, or other effective sensor modalities which the Proposer considers to be technically superior or more affordable or both.  Proposers are reminded that 1) the time urgency of the need argues for mature technologies rather than immature technology requiring many years of development, and 2) end system affordability in production argues against unduly complex and expensive sensor solutions and system architectures.  

PROGRAM GOALS:

Phase 1 Goals (Base Program):  In Phase 1, the Proposer shall demonstrate the feasibility of the concept for estimating crosswind velocity, direction and range to target by modeling / simulations and validating the hit point accuracy by developing sufficient hardware to conduct field measurements.  At the end of Phase 1, the proposed approach must provide answers to the following questions: 

1.	Does the developed approach measure crosswind?  
2.	If so, can it measure crosswind to the maximum effective range of the weapon? 
3.	What is the measurement accuracy of the proposed system compared to other errors (weapon, riflescope magnification, in-line night sight, etc.)?
4.	Is down range wind profiling required?  How often?  Does one need to measure wind in other directions? If not, what?s the error?
5.	What is the maximum overall measurement time?  Does it meet the CONOPS need?
6.	Does the simulated hit point error agree with the field test data? 
7.	How accurately does the approach measure range to target?  
8.	How does it minimize clutter while ranging target?
9.	What is the minimum and maximum offset error at various ranges and wind conditions?  
10.	How is the offset error signal presented to the user (shooter or the spotter)?

Phase 2 Goals (Option 1): In Phase 2, the successful contractor shall package the crosswind measurement and compensation system into a prototype.  The Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) of One-Shot shall commensurate with battlefield operational and environmental requirements and interface with the weapon or spotting scope.  The desired system, as a minimum, will include the sensing and display elements that will be fully integrated with a riflescope (desired) or spotter's scope.  It is required that different methods and design approaches for integrating the One-Shot sensing and display technologies into the riflescope and/or spotting scope be identified, described and a plan provided to demonstrate manufacturing in volume along with cost matrix for the bill of materials (BOM). The Proposer must provide a concept design approach for packaging the various components culminating in a field deployable crosswind and range measurement system that is rugged, small, and lightweight and can operate for 100 hours on one battery charge.  

The contractor must provide the impact of integrating the proposed sensing and display system into the riflescope or the spotter scope on the battlefield concept of operation (CONOPS).  Substantial deviations from the current field operational practices are discouraged.  Minor changes that improve the efficiency and ultimately the overall performance of the mission should be described.  These eventually will be provided as part of the training resources and instruction sets, and will be part of the deliverables for this effort.  

A SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding clearance are required to perform as a contractor under this BAA.  Organizations that do not have BOTH of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does.
DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-03) on or before 4:00 p.m., local Arlington, VA time, February 5, 2007.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or vehicle is subject to negotiation.  The government reserves the right to choose the type of contract instrument ultimately awarded.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Section 217 and PL 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are described in the following paragraphs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  In descending order of importance, the proposal Evaluation Criteria includes: (a) Technical Approach and Innovations that Best Meet the program objectives; (b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (c) Program Schedule that Minimizes Development Risks and Offers Mature Technologies Due to the Time Urgency of the Needs; (d) Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience; (e) Technology Transition Approach and Manufacturing Plan; and (f) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  

In accordance with FAR 35.016(e) the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Schedule and cost reasonableness and realism shall also be considered to the extent appropriate as described herein.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed. 

NOTE: PROPOSERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT EVALUATION SCORES MAY BE LOWERED AND/OR PROPOSALS REJECTED IF SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be CLASSIFIED.  Guidance regarding the marking, packaging, and delivery of classified proposals is provided in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification and Proposers Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  A SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding clearance will be required to perform awards issued under this BAA.  (Organizations that do not have both of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does if the organization does not receive or generate classified material.)

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional details regarding program objectives, development and integration schedule, and milestone criteria are provided in a classified addendum to the associated program BAA.  To receive the classified addendum, your organization's CAGE code must list both the facility and safeguarding clearances, as a minimum, at the SECRET level.  Proposers are advised to email their Facility Security Officer's (FSO) name, phone number, secure fax number, and classified registry mailing address, and CAGE code to Mark.Doody@darpa.mil as soon as possible, in order to receive the classified addendum in time to prepare their proposal accordingly.  The classified addendum will be sent ONLY to each organization's FSO.

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to BAA07-03@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpar t 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. A firm-fixed-price contract will be negotiated. The contract is antici pated to be awarded in March 2007. The contractor and key consultants may be required to obtain a valid facility clearance at no additional cost to the government and have the ability to safeguard materials to the classification level of confidential. A DD  Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, which specifies the exact security requirements, will be included in the request for a pricing proposal from the selected offeror. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract. The plan is not required with this submittal. Where this contract is used in the development of the Request for Proposal design-build br idging documents (FAR 36.302), the A-E and all supporting consulting firms shall be prohibited from competition in the final design-build construction solicitation in accordance with FAR 9.505-2 (Preparing specifications or work statements) and FAR 36.209 (Construction contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms.) SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: If a large business is selected, a subcontracting plan with the final fee proposal will be required, consistent with Section 806 (b) of PL 100-180, 95-907, 99-661. The proposed subcontracting goals for this contract, which  may be adjusted before issuance of the Request for the Proposal to the selected firm are as follows: a minimum of 45% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), 20% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses ( SDB), 10.0% be placed with women-owned small businesses (WOSB), 3.0% be placed with HUB Zone small business, 3% to Veteran Owned Small Business(VOSB), and 3.0% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. A detailed subcontracting plan mus t be submitted during contract negotiation. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan why the above goals cannot be met. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding proced ures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. PROJECT INFORMATION: The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), an organization of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), is charged with the development, testing, and evaluation of medical treatments a nd materiel to prevent and treat casualties of chemical warfare agents. Its mission includes fundamental and applied research in the pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, pathology, and biochemistry of chemical agents and their medical countermeasures. In addition to research, the Institute educates health care providers in the medical management of chemical and biological agent casualties. The USAMRICD sup ports a Chemical/Biological Rapid Response Team (C/B-RRT), supports and trains theater Army medical laboratory personnel, and maintains a unique chemical surety facility. The Institute plays a key role in the Department of Defense (DoD) as the only medical  laboratory in the DoD equipped to safely study highly hazardous chemical agents. This project will design the replacement, expansion, and renovation of the existing USAMRICD facilities, and will provide the facilities capability required to support USAMRI CDs expanding chemical defense mission including medical chemical defense product testing and evaluation. The primary facilities will include BSL-2 laboratories including areas for working with chemical agents, biological agents, associated laboratory sup port spaces; vivarium and vivarium support to include Animal BSL-2 Animal Research and Animal Holding (ABSL-2) for various species including non-human primates; administrative; support space; and a central energy plant.    To meet USAMRICD mission requirements, A-E services are required to provide design and related services for construction of USAMRICD, a Department of Defense Medical (DODM) facility of approximately 330,000 gross square-feet and the Chemical Biological Def ense Lab (CBDL), a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) project of approximately 30,000 gross square-feet.  USAMRICD is a  multi-story chemical agent containment biomedical research laboratory/animal research facility (with Type II construction) on special foundations, an exterior compatible with installation architectural standards, communications, intrusion detection and fire detection and reporting systems, automatic building sprinklers, energy monitoring and control systems (EMCS), building information s ystems. The CBDL facility includes a medical research laboratory, vivarium and has similar functions as USAMRICD. Supporting facilities include medical gas utilities (02, C02, LN2, N2), conventional utilities (water, sewer, gas, central district chilled wa ter, steam), electrical services (including emergency power generation), paving, walks, parking, fencing, storm drainage, communication and information systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and site improvements that include landscaping and new acces s drives. Energy studies and life cycle cost analyses are required. The project will also include decommissioning, decontamination and demolition of existing facilities which may include hazardous materials surveys (including PCBs, radioactive, etc.), asb estos and lead based paint surveys/abatement requirements. The approximately 330,000 gross square foot DODM USAMRICD and 30,000 square foot BRAC CBDL will utilize design-bid-build methodology. For the design-bid-build method, complete contract documents an d other supporting documents will be required to be prepared, and may  include multiple phased design packages. Phased design packages will be implemented if the project construction funding cycle is determined to be phased. Phased packages will be designe d as complete and usable stand alone facilities.  Should the construction funding cycle be determined to incremental, the entire 330,000 square foot DOD Medical facility and the related BRAC 30,000 square foot facility will be designed as one integral comp lete and usable project. In the unlikely event that the DODM USAMRICD facility is not funded for construction, the related  30,000 square foot BRAC CBDL facility  may be constructed using either design-bid-build or the design-build method. If the design-bu ild method is selected, bridging documents to approximately the 35% level, a request for proposal, and other supporting documents will be required to be prepared. Both the DODM USAMRICD and BRAC CBDL will be designed in accordance with Unified Facilities C riteria, UFC 4-510-01 (MIL-HDBK-1191), DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings UFC 4-010-01, CDC-NIH Bio-safety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories 4th Edition, Biologic al Defense Safety Program AR 385-69 and DA Pamphlet 385-69, Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-61, Toxic Chemical Agent Safety Standards, Army Regulation 50-6, Chemical Surety, Department of Agricultural Animal Research Services Facilities Design Standard s 242.1M dated July 2002, National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 1996), National Research Council Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Research Animals (NRC 1999), the Americans with Disabilities Ac t and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/ADAAG), Army Regulation 190-59, Chemical Agent Security Program, Army Regulation 50-6, Chemical Surety, Army Regulation 190-13, the Army Physical Security Program, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Sta ndards for Buildings, DoD Security Engineering criteria, and all other required DOD and Army criteria. All required antiterrorism and force protection (AT/FP) measures will be provided and may include structural hardening and progressive collapse analysis.  AT/FP measures for the new construction building include laminated glass, aluminum and/or steel window and door frames, mass notification system, building separation, and standoff distance. Sustainable design and development items (SDD) will be included. Commissioning of building systems, operations and maintenance manuals, and Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) will be provided. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided. Heating and air conditioning will be self-contained systems. Both pr ojects will be designed to meet the Silver level of U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using US Army Corps of Engineers' Computer Aided Cost Estimatin g System (M-CACES GOLD). The Government will provide software. Design drawings will be produced in a format fully compatible with Microstation 32 Version 4.0.3 or higher or AutoCad Version 2002 or higher and developed using a Building Information Modeling (BIM) 3-D digital modeling tool to ensure functionality of all spaces, constructability, operability, and maintainability. The specifications will be produced in SPECSINTACT using Unified Facilities Guide Specifications. Design review comments and their re sponses will be provided using the US Army Corps of Engineers Review Management System Proj/Net/DrChecks system.

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be  issued on or about 01 May 2007, will include a draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor?s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government  anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil .

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

<DESC>Below are the questions received regarding RFI NNJ07ISSBG and NASA's response.  The Due Date for responses is 4 pm cst Monday, January 8, 2007. 1.  What office is this being run out of at JSC?  The ISS Program Office. 2.  Is there a designated technical point of contact?  No.  The designated point of contact is the Contracting Officer. 3.  Does NASA have a date for the issuance of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP)?  No.  The Request for Information (RFI) was issued as part of an exchange to improve the understanding of industry capabilities.  JSC along with headquarters will review the responses before determining whether to issue a formal RFP. The purpose of this RFI is to gain an understanding of available cargo capabilities in both foreign and domestic markets. This understanding will allow NASA to formulate a procurement strategy. 4. Are the RFI Table attachments intended to convey maximum sizes of current vehicles?  Any proposed vehicles should be capable of accommodating those requirements. 5.  Can respondents assume they will be allowed to provide a demonstration flight?  Although final requirements for an RFP have not been decided upon at this time, it is likely that no demonstration flight will be allowed since respondents should already have a proven system with flight history and successful capability to complete rendezvous and docking/berthing operations to the ISS.  Respondents should include a discussion on their need or desire for a demonstration flight.  6.  Is the April 2009 date for an operational review?  No, respondents should have an "operational capability of April 2009.  Therefore, the system should be able to support a launch date that could be as early as April 2009. 7.  How does this relate to the Commercial Orbital Transportation System (COTS) Program?  It is intended to bridge the gap before COTS is ready.  It is not intended to replace or duplicate COTS. 8.  Is there a time frame for expected launches over a certain period of time?  No.  There is only "a single flight in 2009.  9.  Is there a standard format for the RFI response?  No.  10.  Could you provide a clarification of due dates?  Responses to the RFI should be emailed to the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer by 4:00 p.m. CST on January 8, 2007.  See #20 for additional information. 11.  Are we allowed to propose additional capabilities to possibly offer NASA in the RFI response?  Respondents can approach the RFI response however they choose.  Additional data may be added as long as the data requested in the RFI is also included.  12.  Does NASA plan to issue any more RFIs regarding cargo upmass?  There are not any other RFIs regarding upmass capability planned at this time.   13.  Does NASA agree that U.S. Space Transportation Policy, Implementation Guidelines, Section V(1)(a) requires that NASA, if it wishes to purchase an ISS cargo delivery mission using a foreign launch vehicle, must obtain an exemption from the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy?  See #18 below. 14.  Is such an exemption currently in place, and if so what are the constraints on its use for an ISS cargo delivery mission?  See #18 below. 15.  If NASA were to obtain such an exemption, might that allow the use of cost-competitive foreign launch vehicles by any or all potential offerors?  See #18 below. 16.  Does NASA agree that the Commercial Space Act of 1998 (PL 105-303) requires that NASA buy space transportation services from U.S. commercial suppliers, as defined in that legislation, and therefore not from foreign governments or companies?  See #18 below. 17.  Since NASA has requested information from foreign governments and/or foreign primes regarding this prospective ISS cargo delivery mission, what exception to the Commercial Space Act of 1998 (PL 105-303) requirement to buy from U.S. commercial providers does NASA believe will allow foreign providers to bid on an RFP?  See #18 below. 18.  Does the publicly-stated official policy of NASA HQ, that NASA shall first purchase ISS cargo services first from U.S. commercial providers, secondly using the CEV cargo derived system, and lastly from international partners, apply to this prospective ISS cargo procurement?  If the answer is Yes, does NASA only plan to buy this ISS cargo delivery mission (and any additional future services) from foreign providers if no qualified U.S. commercial provider capabilities exist?  NASA will comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, and policies regarding ISS cargo services.  NASA cannot address this issue in more detail at this time since the purpose of this RFI is to gather information. Specific answers may depend upon the capabilities that exist if or when a RFP is released. 19.  The Average Cargo Density is specified as "230 kg/m3 for launch cargo."  Is that for gross or net cargo?  Does NASA have a target density for cargo accommodations?  That is for gross cargo. The program assumed the number includes packing provisions (CTBs) and is being used as the packed bag weights. 20.  Since the reply should be in a .pdf format, are electronic copies of responses to this RFI sufficient, or do three (3) electronic copies on physical media (CD, etc.) need to be provided?  Electronic .pdf responses should be emailed to the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer.  3 hard copies are not required. 21.  Do letters of support and table of contents count toward the 25 page maximum?  Yes.  The total of all documents should not exceed 25 pages.  Responses should address the 4 points being asked (i.e. proven system; letters from subs, foreign government; April 2009 operational capability; pricing information).  Responses detailing documented capabilities against the tables aren't expected unless/until an RFP is issued. 22.  Can we joint venture this RFI with a foreign partner?  Yes. 23.  Does the 2,000 kg payload include the weight of the pressurized container?  2,000 kg is the packed cargo only.  It does not include the mass of the cargo accommodations or carrier/vehicle. 24.  The RFI states a dock time of not less than 30 days.  What is the maximum dock time, and is recharge power available from the ISS?  The ISS system does not have a maximum dock time.  However, the vehicle should have the flexibility to depart at any time.  Yes, power is available from the ISS.  As stated in the RFI, please identify any ISS capabilities the responder will be using. 25.  What are the restrictions on propellants, e.g., MMH, which may be used in the vicinity of the ISS?  There are no restrictions on the use of specific propellants.  There are restrictions on the amount of contamination and the loads that a visiting vehicle can impart on the ISS during proximity operations.  Those specific technical requirements will be provided when and if a request for proposal is issued. 26.  Is the final docking human-in-the-loop from the ISS?  The answer depends on what the responder needs.   For the purposes of this RFI, the responders should identify what capabilities are required from the ISS, including any crew actions, to support their vehicles docking or berthing. 27.  Are there any restrictions on reentry trash disposal?  No, there are no ISS cargo restrictions on trash disposal.  Restrictions have been typically driven by the reentry vehicles certification envelope. 28.  The subject RFI, requests data that supports a proven system with flight history and successful capability to complete rendezvous and docking/berthing operations to the ISS.  This statement seems to limit participation to those spacecraft that have already carried cargo to the ISS and successfully docked/undocked. If this is not the case, please clarify NASAs expectations regarding what constitutes a proven system with flight history, and successful capability to complete rendezvous and docking/ berthing operations to the ISS.  If a RFP is released, NASAs interest would be in those spacecrafts that already have a proven system of being able to successfully dock or berth with the ISS.  This capability should be demonstrated by the time a proposal for these services is submitted, which would occur in approximately June 2007. 29.  Please clarify the reference in paragraph 4) to the ISS hardware and software interface planned for post April 2009. Is there somewhere that this requirement is documented for reference by a potential supplier?  SSP 50504, ISS Configuration Document, identifies the ISS vehicles planned physical configuration for the current manifest through 2010.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
?	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
?	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
?	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent?s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC>NOTICE HAS BEEN REVISED TO CHANGE ANTICIPATED POSTING DATE OF RFP FROM DECEMBER 21, 2006 TO JANUARY 2, 2007.

The Office of Clinical Research Affairs (OCRA) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in infectious diseases.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE,  NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period with performance beginning on or about March 3, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 40.75 FTEs.    

The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to understand and ultimately prevent and/or treat diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV that threaten millions of lives every year.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  DMID is also responsible for advancing clinical research and conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic agents against potential bioterrorist pathogens and new and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health importance, such as avian influenza and SARS.    

The primary goal of this seven-year effort is to facilitate the evaluation of new vaccines, other prophylactic strategies, and therapeutic agents for infectious diseases of priority to the Division.  Support will be provided for single- and multi-center Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials of vaccines, other biologics, therapeutic agents aimed at bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases that occur in people of all ages at DMID-sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) and other clinical research centers.  The contractor's primary goal will be to coordinate clinical trials with respect to elements of study planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis and related support activities.  This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors and DMID staff.  

The support services to be provided by the contractor under this contract include the following: 1) computerized systems for the collection, management, storage, security, reporting and quality control of study data including systems to accommodate on-line subject enrollment and randomization; 2) statistical expertise in study design and analysis of trials; 3) assistance with preparation of study-related materials such as Manuals of Operations, case report forms and/or source documents and tracking logs; 4) development and maintenance of protocol web sites to share information and study materials with study sites and to provide DMID with real-time study information, such as overall and site-specific accrual, demographics, adverse events, queries, and deviations; 5) development and maintenance of an electronic inventory system to identify and track clinical study specimens; 6) providing training to clinical site staff to access the data system, perform remote data entry and enter clinical specimens into the electronic inventory system; 7) assessing capabilities and providing assistance to sites that intend to perform their own data collection, management, security and quality control; and 8) serving as a repository to store data from completed studies.

The Request for Proposal document will be available electronically on or about January 2, 2007, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps <http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (the Agency) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is planning on the award of a contract on a sole-source basis to the Center for Health Improvement (CHI) as part of a technical assistance effort for local, multi-stakeholder quality collaboratives, a subset of which are being cosponsored by and coordinated with Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).    

The overarching goal of the collaboratives is to enhance care by improving the quality of healthcare services and reducing healthcare costs.   The goal of this award is to develop a technical curriculum and implementation component to provide the collaborative sites with evidence, methods and tailored tools to facilitate achievement of the overarching collaborative goal.   The timeline is tight as the sites have been selected and are awaiting technical assistance; the aim is to have the contractor work with the collaboratives to prioritize technical assistance needs in February 2007.   The curriculum will be 100% driven by needs of the collaborative leadership.  

CHI has unique qualifications for this task.   Foremost CHI provides technical assistance to RWJF Aligning Forces collaborative grantees, and the Agency expects to coordinate and build upon these CHI efforts.  With CHI as the technical assistance vendor for both the RWJF and the Agency, resulting cosponsored curriculum and implementation components will be seamless to the sites (vs appear as dueling sets of parallel activities, each with duplicative planning structures to support the activities).  

Other unique qualifications include CHIs expertise, experience and capacity to: 1) provide logistics support in convening workshop and IT support for electronic dissemination venues; 2) begin curriculum development and implementation with little start up time; 3) design technical assistance for local quality improvement collaboratives, including break-through collaboratives; 4) develop and implement curriculum on range of subtopics under rubric of data aggregation and publicly reporting, to include evidence-based efficiency, quality and patient safety measures; 5) develop and implement curriculum on range of subtopics under rubric of consumer incentives, consumer engagement and provider financial incentives for quality and efficiency; 6) quickly identify and tap existing network of key operational leadership of local collaboratives; and 7) quickly identify and tap existing network of key national technical experts in requisite subject areas.

The objectives of the contract are to:  
A. With little lead time, develop and implement technical curriculum on data aggregation and publicly reporting the data.   
B. With little lead time, develop and implement technical curriculum on consumer engagement and provider financial incentives.  
C.  Provide logistics for range of dissemination strategies, which may include webinars, audio conferences, in-person workshops and/or site-specific TA sessions as needed.

For this requirement, sources must possess qualifications and demonstrate experience (with specific examples of past performance) in each the following technical areas: 1)  logistics support in convening workshop and IT support for electronic dissemination venues; 2) curriculum development and implementation tailored specifically for local, multi-stakeholder quality collaboratives; 3) evidence-based data aggregation and public reporting;  4) evidence-based consumer incentives, consumer engagement and provider financial incentives for quality and efficiency; 5) familiarity with existing network of key operational leadership of quality collaboratives; and 6) familiarity with existing network of key national technical experts in requisite subject areas.   Sources also must demonstrate (with example) track record in effectively coordinating similar activities supported by more than one funder in seamless manner.  

Interested organizations capable of performing the above requisite qualifications and expertise should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting their ability to meet the Governments requirements as described above no later than 12:00 noon on January 8, 2007.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements must be submitted electronically to Jessica Alderton at Jessica.Alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov.  Capability statements received after 12:00 noon on January 8, 2007 will not be reviewed.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>C -- USAID Mission to Guatemala, proposes to modify existing contract 520-C-00-06-00079-00 with Mr. Glenn Cameron under the Mission?s Operating Expenses Program.
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Guatemala, USAID/Guatemala proposes to modify existing contract 520-C-00-06-00079-00 with Mr. Glenn Cameron under the Mission?s Operating Expenses Program.  The Mission requirement is an eight (8) months extension of  Mr. Cameron?s Non PSC contract without a change in the Scope of Work, the total estimated cost of the original contract will be increased by $115, 350 The primary purpose of the original contract is to provide engineering and construction oversight of the USAID/Guatemala IOB Project and provide monthly reports to the USAID Executive Officer.  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the developer who will construct the IOB and compound is following established criteria provided by Department of State Diplomatic Security, the Office of Overseas Building Operations and USAID?s Office of Security in the design and construction of a new office building for USAID/Guatemala.  .  The requirement of the extension period was brought by unexpected delays in the approval of the construction project of the new office building at Washington?s level and the signature of the lease agreement with the owners of the building. Therefore it is necessary to extend the period of performance of Mr. Cameron?s contract to allow him to fully perform its original objectives.  Issuing a new instrument for such a small period of time is not practical because of the additional costs and time required to get a new mechanism established and fully functioning for a relatively short-term, and also because current implementation momentum would be disrupted.  The Mission does not anticipate contracting this type of services in the future as this is a specific project that will be finalized by the end of the calendar year 2007.   This modification to contract No. 520-C-00-06-00079-00 is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contract a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.  No solicitation is available.

B&A is a bracket with an alignment  process representing the final step in the manufacture of the OR-336/A Cooler-Dewar Group, NSN 5855-01-172-1788.  B&A involves the installation of the bracket coupled with an extremely precise optical alignment procedure that together assures that the OR- 336/A Cooler-Dewar Group, NSN: 5855-01-293-1592, which is provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM), is properly bore-sighted when installed.  The performance of the bracket and alignment procedure requires a complex infrared optical alignment table,  computer interface measurement devices and infrared sources.  This solicitation will be issued on a Limited Competition basis since currently there are only two contractors,  Lockheed-Martin Corporation (Orlando, FL) and Canadian Commercial Corporation/DR S Technologies (Ontario, Canada), that have operational facilities with the necessary equipment needed to perform the required  B&A  procedures and meet the  Governments delivery schedule requirement.  The Government does not posses the technical data nec essary to enable competition for this proposed action.   The point of contact (POC) for this notice is Contract Specialist, Dennis Olson, who can be reached at the following email address: dennis.olson1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The National Eye Institute is a component of the National Institutes of Health and has the following requirement: 		VA Diabetes Trial, CSP #465
?Glycemic Control and Complications in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2?

This study is designed to evaluate the following research question:  Does intensive glucose control affect major macrovascular endpoints in a defined veteran population? This is a clinical trial designed and conducted with the expertise of the VA Cooperative Studies Program.  The target populations will be patients with type 2 DM, over 40 years of age, with HbA1c greater than 4 SD above normal and already on maximum doses of one or more oral agents and/or on insulin.  Subjects will be randomized to one of two arms.  In the standard arm, the goal will be to prevent hyper-or hypoglycemic symptoms and maintain HbA1c between 8-9% and prevent values above 9.5%.  In the intensive arm, the goals will be to avoid hypoglycemia and achieve HbA1c levels within normal limits.  

The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of any of several major macrovascular events listed in the proposal: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation due to ischemic gangrene, congestive heart failure, or invasive intervention for coronary or peripheral vessel disease.  Other endpoints include retinopathy and renal events, clinical neuropathy, appearance or worsening of several macrovascular indicators (angina, claudication, etc.) and quality of life assessments.  

Twenty centers will recruit and follow 1700 patients for an average of 6 years.  The study is approved to assess microvascular endpoints, including fundus photographs at entry and end of study.  Diabetic retinopathy will also be assessed by annual examination, and interventions as needed to prevent visual loss such as laser treatment and cataract extraction will be counted as ophthalmologic end-points.  As designed, the study will have 98% power to detect a 25% reduction in the combined endpoint of progression of existing retinopathy and appearance of new retinopathy. 
Concerns that respond to this synopsis shall furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit proposal and/or capability statements in an Original Plus Two (2) no later than ten (10) business days from the date of this announcement, December 22, 2006, due in COB Jan. 05, 2007.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>This Amendment to RFQ 66894 is issued to extend  the response date for quotes through December 25, 2006 5PM Eastern Time; and post the following questions and answers.  No further questions regarding this RFQ will be entertained. Question 7:  On the 10K+ thermal human detection. Is this detection requirement with Optical Zoom or can the 10K+ be achieve with Digital zoom assistance? Answer 7: The 10K specification can be met with either optical or digital, however proposals should specify which type is being offered including all specifications.  Question 8:  What type of pan/tilt precision specifications do you require at the longer (Narrow) zoom ranges; at that extreme Focal length, a strict, precise pan/tilt mechanism needs to be implemented in order to keep the targets in the FOV. Answer 8: Respondent should state the precision of the pan/tilt unit proposed, as well as cost. More than one type of pan/tilt can be specified for the bundle; all will be considered for selection. Question 9:  Do you require GPS, rangefinder, compass, or software for signature detection, tracking & alarming? Answer 9: None of the items noted are required at this time, however the immediate availability of this type of equipment as an add-on at a later date could add value and can be presented, if available, with the response. Question 10:  You state that the environmental temperature operating range is -50 to 125 degrees f. ? is this for all systems or can a low temperature option be provided for those imagers intended for cold climates?.   Answer 10:  All imagers must meet this operational temperature range.  Question 11:  Is there a corresponding temperature specified for storage and is this in excess of the operating temperature stated?  Answer 11:  There is no storage temperature requirement.  However, it would be expected that the storage temperature range would meet or exceed the operating temperature requirements. Question 12:  You state that the ?power? for the thermal imager is to be 12V to 30V in both DC and AC voltage. Is there a corresponding AC voltage that would be acceptable other than 12V to 30V? Answer 12:  The requirement is 12V to 30V. Question 13:  You do not specify if the power source should be ruggedized or weatherproof ? are there both ?indoor? rated components, such as the Universal controller or power supply, and are there ?outdoor? rated components, like the thermal imager.  If so, do these different groups of components have different environmental or packaging expectations? Answer 13:  This system will be used in a rugged and outdoor environment.  All components should be ruggedized and weatherproof. Question 14:  You state that the electronic zoom function is 12 to 240 mm ? can we assume that the zoom ratio of 20X is the minimum standard based on visible camera format.  Answer 14:  Yes. Question 15:  You state that the elevation axis range of movement (?+/-90 degree tilt?) is 90 degrees. Is this a minimum requirement and are other ranges of travel also acceptable if they exceed 45 degrees?   Answer 15:  Yes.  This (+90 and -90 degree tilt) is a minimum requirement and a greater range would be considered. Question 16:  You state in the solicitation that the Government wants a price on quantity 35 Control Cables ?minimum specifications: 0-150 feet, compatible w/ specific system components? ? can you clarify what is/are the desired cable length(s) and are you also requesting information on the maximum distances capable? Answer 16:  These systems may be placed on varying heights and types of booms with 150ft cable maximum required for any system.  A response for 30ft, 50ft, 100ft and 150ft length cables would be appropriate.
