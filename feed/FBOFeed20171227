Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Responses are desired from any/all eligible small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. 

FAA anticipates that any resultant contract will be a Fixed-Price contract.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, in particular service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the required items. 

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.

<a href="mailto:anna.kurzeja@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) Undersea Integration Program Office (PMW 770), intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) on the basis of full and open competition for continued development, maintenance, and sustainment of the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) Control and Management (C&M) software for submarine and other platforms.  The incumbent contractor for CSRR C&M software is Lockheed Martin under contract N00039-13-C-0039.
This announcement is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or obligation to issue a future solicitation. This announcement does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services. Companies interested in the anticipated RFP should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov for the release of the RFP.
The CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.
The technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.  Additionally, access to classified information up to and including Top Secret is anticipated. All necessary security measures will be followed, and will be identified on the CSRR C&M DD Form 254 should procurement take place.
Specification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non- Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil) entitled, "Bidder's Repository NDA" and provide the e-mail address and phone number for up to two users to Anna Kurzeja, anna.kurzeja@navy.mil.  Each company must also provide a copy of a fully executed DoD DD Form-2345 "Military Critical Technical Data Agreement".  If the company does not have an active DD 2345 on file and cannot provide a Joint Certification Program (JCP) number, please visit DLIS at:  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for more information on how to complete and submit the DD 2345.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA - issued PKI certificate, contact Kymberlee Boisvert for further instruction at kymberlee.boisvert@navy.mil.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.
Questions and comments regarding the specification documents are requested to be submitted no later than 26 May 2017. Questions and comments are requested to be submitted in writing via e-mail only to: Anna Kurzeja, Contract Specialist, SPAWAR 2.1B19, (anna.kurzeja@navy.mil).  Verbal questions and comments will not be accepted. The Government will provide public answers to all questions and comments received regarding the specification documents and anticipated RFP via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  All questions and comments shall be in a format non-attributable to the company or individual submitting the questions or comments to allow for public release.
The Government anticipates issuing a Cost type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330-Engineering Services.
The estimated date for solicitation release is October 2017.

The Expert Builder Toolkit developed by Expert-24 includes three tools, WebBuilder, VirtualExpert, AssetBuilder, which run the HLA engine.  These tools are linked to databases and schemas that are updated on the clinical aspects as medical updates become available and these updates go directly into the HLA platform. The technical support services for the existing product tools are required to ensure that the HLA platform remains operational as updates are completed.  Any other source other than Expert-24 Inc. would require access to the proprietary software source code as well as expert knowledge of these tools in order to provide the aforementioned technical support.  Without the expert knowledge of these tools and support needed to troubleshoot any errors found, the My Healthe Vet (MHV) development staff will not be able to ensure the 4 million Veterans currently using the HLA platform have accurate and 24/7 availability to their assessments.  Without these technical support services, specifically the Tier III level support, VA would be unable to escalate modifications, enhancements, or repairs to the HLA to maintain its operation availability.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541511 with a corresponding small business size standard of $25.5M average annual revenue.  The estimated date of award for this action is January 19, 2018. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Monica Green, Contract Specialist, monica.green@va.gov and Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

<DESC><p>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only for the development and production of the Advanced Radar Threat System-Variant 3 (ARTS-V3).</p>
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which has a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hub-zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code if applicable. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services provided to the Government and to commercial customers within the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work that will be accomplished by the teaming partners. The information provided will be used to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government will not provide reimbursement for the information provided.</p>
<p>2. PROGRAM DETAILS:</p>
<p>2.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability.</p>
<p>2.2 The ARTS-V3 program anticipates a pre-Milestone B program to replicate an air defense system based on a modern foreign, currently fielded, long range threat system. The primary radar of interest for the ARTS-V3 program operates within the C-Band frequency range. This is the primary threat/system that ARTS-V3 will replicate, however the ARTS-V3 program also anticipates the need to replicate a wide variety of high-fidelity threats from a common training device, possibly across multiple RF spectral bands. The concept of ARTS-V3 is that the system will replicate a certain threat during one engagement, and then a different threat during subsequent engagements on the same training day. ARTS-V3 will be a robust, ruggedized, and mobile system capable of operating at both established training ranges and semi-prepared or unprepared exercise sites. The ARTS-V3 system will provide threat-representative radar tracking and reactivity to include acquiring, tracking, and engaging multiple aircraft simultaneously with representative receiver/processor and electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities. The system radar signal will meet threat-representative parametric data of the actual threat(s). Additionally, the system will provide threat-representative full effective radiated power of the primary C-Band radar of interest, replicate threat signals, antenna patterns, operational modes and threat tactics capabilities, and the capability to send real-time radar data to the Range Control Center (RCC) or Live Missions Operations Center (LMOC) in conjunction with the range's Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS)-controlled threat environment for processing and analysis. ARTS-V3 will be threat-representative at a high level of fidelity across the electromagnetic spectrum. The system needs to replicate threats at a high enough fidelity to stress current electronic warfare systems, support 5th Generation aircraft engagements, and support CAF Live Virtual Constructive implementation.</p>
<p>2.3 The ARTS-V3 system includes antenna, transmitters, all command, control, and communications (C3) equipment, power generation equipment, and any other ground support equipment necessary to facilitate a true-to-threat site footprint.</p>
<p>2.4 The ARTS-V3 Technical Data Package (TDP) is planned to be a comprehensive source file capable of supporting re-procurement, re-manufacturing, operational mission requirements, and total organic system sustainment of both hardware and software. The Government intends to acquire data rights for the ARTS-V3 TDP as defined in DFARS 227.7103-5, DFARS 252.227-7013, and DFARS 252.227-7014 in order to maintain competition throughout the lifecycle.</p>
<p>2.5 AFLCMC/HBZ, Aerospace Dominance Enabler Division, Hill AFB, UT intends to award one contract to develop and field the ARTS-V3 system(s). The ARTS-V3 specifications are to be defined in future ITEAMS reports and the System Performance Specification (SPS). These reports are currently being developed and will be released during future market research events. Subject to change, AFLCMC/HBZ could be looking to field 15 C-Band systems within a 4 year development and 5 year production period.</p>
<p><br />3. INDUSTRY RESPONSE: All information submitted shall be Unclassified. Information submitted containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. Information submitted will be retained at AFLCMC/HBZCD and will not be returned. The Government requests the information be submitted in electronic format to Melissa Huston no later than February 9 2018.</p>
<p>3.1 The Government requests interested parties provide the following information:<br />a. Company Name and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.<br />b. Name, phone number, and email address for a point of contact(s).<br />c. The applicable North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511: Based on this NAICS code what is your size status? <br />&#61552; Small Business<br />&#61552; Small Disadvantaged <br />&#61552; Women-Owned<br />&#61552; Veteran-Owned<br />&#61552; Service Disabled Veteran Owned<br />&#61552; Hub-zone<br />&#61552; Large Business<br />d.

One of the most important audit steps in Incurred Cost Audits is the determination of the appropriate salary and wage survey data used to benchmark contractor compensation levels in order to determine reasonableness. Absent an appropriate survey used by the contractor, auditors require a readily available source of survey data. DCAA has updated the Audit Programs for Forward Pricing and Proposal Audits, and both include a revised emphasis on determining that the contractor's proposed rates are reasonable based on market data. The information contained in the reports is used by DCAA's auditors in making a determination of the reasonableness of a contractor's employee compensation including executive compensation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-6. The FAR provides that compensation can be determined reasonable by comparison to the compensation practices of other firms of the same size, in the same industry, in the same geographic area, and engaged in similar non-Government work under comparable circumstances. ALL FAR listed criteria must be satisfied.</span></p>

<p><strong>Description of Requirement<br /></strong><br />(1)	The U.S. Department of Commerce, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boulder, CO conducts an upper air observation program at the Weather Service Contract Meteorological Observatory (WSCMO) at the Denver International Airport in Denver, CO, which meets a variety of needs and serves a variety of users.  Upper air observations are taken and coded for the operational use of meteorologists and hydrologists, as well as for international dissemination.<br /><br />(2)	NOAA contemplates award of a contract for upper air observation and reporting services at the WSCMO located at Denver International Airport in Denver, CO.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $15.0 million. The contracting office is contemplating a base year plus four one-year options contract beginning on 4-1-2018. The contractor shall furnish all supervision and labor to take, document, and disseminate upper air observations using the Radiosonde Replacement System (RRS) workstation in Denver, CO. <strong><em>All observers shall be RRS certified by the NWS and be able to maintain certification during the contract period of performance.</em></strong> <br /><br />(3)	All services conducted in connection with the performance of the contract shall be in accordance with the most recent revision(s) of upper air observing manuals and guidelines used by the NWS. National Weather Service Manual 10-1401available at the following link: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01014001curr.pdf</span><br /><br />(4)	Observations shall be taken two times daily, each and every day of the contract period.   Observations shall have a standard scheduled release time of 0000 and 1200 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Required upper air data shall be transmitted to National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) at the prescribed times for all scheduled releases. <br /> <br />(5)	Normally, the completion of one upper air observation using the RRS requires the attention of one observer for a minimum of 3.25 hours.  The Contractor shall have an RRS certified observer on duty at the WSCMO from 1015 to 1330 UTC and 2215 to 0130 UTC each day of the contract period.  Additional time may be required when second releases are needed or if other problems arise.  On average, there are 6 second releases annually.<br /><br />(6)	Observation balloons to be used in the taking of the RRS observation shall be inflated with hydrogen or helium gas, at the discretion of the government. The hydrogen and/or helium gases are bottled, and shall be furnished by the Government. All operating instructions and applicable safety equipment shall be supplied by the Government. The Contractor shall take all necessary precautions to ensure that appropriate safety measures are followed when working with hydrogen and/or helium gas.<br /><br />(7)	Special RRS observations are deemed as those observations  which  are  requested  by  the  NWS,  in  addition to  those  specified  above. The Contractor shall be required to take, record, and document a special RRS observation associated with NWS sanctioned field projects or critical meteorological events. Normally, the RRS observation requires the attention of one RRS certified observer for a minimum of three (3) hours for a special observation. Special launches will be ordered as needed.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a.	Whenever possible, the NWS shall provide notification of at least twelve (12) hours before a special RRS observation is required. However, during a weather emergency, this 12 hour advance notice may not be possible. The Contractor shall make every effort to take the requested observation during weather emergencies with a shorter advance notification time.  Typically this shorter advanced notification time will be no less than six (6) hours.  Special observations may require special dissemination and/or handling procedures such as terminating the flight at a lower burst altitude than normally obtained.<br /><br />(8)	The Government shall determine and furnish all forms, charts, and local and national expendable supplies necessary for the Contractor to carry out the requirements of this contract. Local expendable supplies include pens and pencils, paper, forms, CDs, hydrogen, etc. Government provided expendable supplies include RRS instruments, batteries, lighting units, train regulators, parachutes, twine, and balloons.<br /><br />(9)	The Government shall furnish those portions of the handbooks and manuals which provide the regulatory material regarding meteorological observations which the Contractor is required to comply in the performance of this contract. These manuals include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Radiosonde Replacement System Workstation User Guide<br />National Weather Service NWSPD 10-1401<br />Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3 (FMH) Engineering Handbooks Numbers 8, 9 and 15 (EHB)</p>
<p>(10)	All Contractor personnel who are assigned the duties of taking observations shall be certified upper air observers utilizing the RRS system. The requirement procedure for certification by NOAA NWS in upper air observations are outlined in NWSM 10-1401 (see link above). The Contractor's Site Supervisor certification must be verified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Contractor personnel must demonstrate proficiency in all facets of the upper air program. RRS observer and Site Supervisor certificates with the required endorsement(s) will be displayed in plain sight or available for review as necessary. Certifications shall remain current, without lapse, during the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>Uncertified Contractor personnel may watch observations in a training capacity only if supervised by the contract station supervisor, upon advance notification to the COR.</p>
<p>(11)	The upper air observation system utilizes the RRS computer workstation and requires a minimum of 3.25 hours to complete the observation from release to burst, performed by a NWS approved RRS certified observer. Additional time may be necessary to quality control data, complete required reports and perform other upper air observation related tasks.  Much of the operator's time is spent responding to the RRS workstation prompts, data evaluation and quality control.</p>
<p>(12)	Contractor shall perform all services diligently and in a good, professional and first class manner, using good quality materials, equipment and workmanship and sufficiently trained personnel (including supervisors when appropriate) to complete the services in a safe and timely manner which does not unduly interfere with the operation of the WSCMO, or the business therein. Contractor shall obtain and maintain, at its expense and at all times during the term of the contract, all necessary licenses, permits, training or other authorizations which may be necessary to perform the services.</p>

ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.<br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br />Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) used competition to establish GE as the CH-53K engine supplier as part of the initial System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract (N00019-06-C-0081). In 2012, the Government broke out the procurement of the CH-53K T408 engines for the System Development Test Article aircraft as a separate contract (N00019-13-C-0132) from the aircraft development contract (N00019-06-C-0081) in order to avoid delays in the CH-53K Aircraft production schedule.<br />The CH-53K Helicopter is powered by the T408 engine and incorporates proven technology designed and developed by GE from the T64-GE-416/416A/419 engines, which power the Navy and Marine Corps' legacy variants of the H-53, and other GE engines. The T408 uses increased compressor efficiency, erosion resistant coatings, increased airflow, higher turbine temperatures and efficiency, and design techniques to achieve the increased shaft horse power necessary to meet the increased tactical range, payload, and survivability of the CH-53K Helicopter.</p>

<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period.  Draft offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>The Open Period is from the posting date to close on February 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period.  Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG07 and must be located within Region 7.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 201X, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 201X RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY1X AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

 Project Description:

Scope and Objectives:
This Sources Sought notice is for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vacant and Underutilized Buildings located at 2401 W Main Street Marion, IL 62959. The buildings that are available are: Buildings 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 (duplexes) 32, 33, 34 and garages 123, 91, 125 & 93  These buildings are available for outlease under the Enhanced Use Lease Authority (EUL) or the Historic Reuse Program (HRP) described below. These EUL and/or HRP projects are to be for a long-term outlease or exchange.  

Enhanced Use Lease Authority :, Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to outlease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to provide supportive housing that engages tenants in on-site and community-based support services for Veterans or their families who are at risk of homelessness or are homeless.   Enhanced-Use Leases are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VA s jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector for veteran supportive housing. This program is administrated by VA s Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM).

VA Historic Reuse Program (HRP): The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), specifically Title 54 of the United States Code Section 306121-306122, authorizes Federal agencies to outlease or exchange unneeded historic properties and retain the proceeds to fund preservation activities. As VA seeks to actively engage the private sector in strengthening utilization of its real property portfolio, the Department has created a nationwide Historic Reuse Program (HRP) to implement historic outlease and exchanges of underutilized real estate. The HRP is administered by VA s Land Acquisition & Strategic Utilization (LASU) team within the Office of Construction and Facility Management (OCFM).
The objective of this development opportunity includes but is not limited to:
To provide an innovative solution within current authority to preserve a VA-owned, historic property;
To enable a productive use of these properties that do not involve VA capital dollars and benefits all stakeholders; and
To meet VA s obligations under Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) to better preserve and protect the property. 

To maximize achievement of these objectives VA may execute its authority to lease the Subject Property for cash or historic preservation services, or exchange the Subject Property for other comparable historic real property, or any combination thereof.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Library (NAL), intends to award a <strong>sole-source MODIFICATION</strong> to Library Associates of Maryland, LLC. (LAC) on <strong>GSA FSS award AG-32SB-D-17-0169.</strong> Extension would be for 6 months. Current contractor has developed specialized knowledge on the topic area and indexing technology over the past 4 months that will enable them to continue doing the work, thereby seeing the project through to completion on time. Bringing another contractor up to speed would cause unacceptable delays. The work was as follows: As a service providing access to information about the 3Rs and animal welfare, Animal Welfare Information Center (AWIC) is in an ideal situation to assist in collecting, evaluating and synthesizing research results in a citation database. The AWIC staff's knowledge and experience are key to developing a focused topic-specific database for our primary customers, scientists using animals in research. Although many alternatives searches are so specific that they will never repeated, identifying citations that reference or infer 3Rs alternatives will improve implementation of the consideration of alternatives requirement in the federal Animal Welfare Act by making finding them easier. Updating the NAL thesaurus controlled vocabulary will expedite patron access to information and improve the specificity of indexing for 3Rs alternatives in NAL's databases.<br /><br />The contractor will facilitate improved indexing of scientific citations relevant to 3Rs alternatives and ingested into the NAL's databases and develop search strategies for the 3Rs that can be useful for identifying and tagging citations.
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong>. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above on GSA FSS are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong><br /><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong> <br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a concept for converting radioactive energy into electricity using a nuclear thermionic avalanche cell and a thermoelectric generator. The goal is to develop a conversion system with extremely high energy density which would only require "refueling" approximately every 30 years (depending on the application). Such functionality could be attractive in applications where the energy-using device is very remote from energy sources or where there are operational benefits associated with minimal refueling. Excessive heat generated while radioactive material decays is converted to electricity via a thermoelectric generator. One of high density energy source contemplated for terrestrial and space applications is the dual energy conversion systems in tandem mode consisting of the nuclear thermionic avalanche cells (NTAC) as a primary energy conversion engine and the thermoelectric (TE) generator with three regenerative cycles combined as a secondary conversion engine. This dual energy conversion system in tandem mode has a very long life without refueling for at least 30 years and high energy density. Potential applications include high altitude airships, utility-scale electric power generation facilities, electric propulsion for automobiles and airplanes, power for remote and rural communities, nodal power without transmission lines, or marine electric propulsion. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information. Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company. Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register. <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.</strong> <br />

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong>
<p><strong><br />THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a post-friction stir welding heat treatment procedure that reduces abnormal grain growth and restores optimum material properties in heat treatable aluminum alloys. It is a simple, low-cost processing step suitable for large components or structures. This thermal processing methodology is for retaining the fine-grained structure in aluminum alloys subjected to solid state welding and subsequent forming processes. It enables friction stir welding for aerospace components made from lightweight aluminum alloys, in particular, Al-Li alloys. The insertion of an intermediate annealing step covered here reduces abnormal grain growth during post-welding heat treatment, thereby allowing optimum mechanical properties. This is important where Al-Li alloys (and other heat treatable alloys) are friction stir welded followed by deformation processing and high performance, high reliability structural components are required for aerospace vehicles. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.<strong> NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /><br />THE TECHNOLOGY: <br /></strong><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a set of puncture self-healing materials comprised of commercially available, known self-healing polymer resin and additive blends. A range of puncture healing blends was developed by melt blending self-healing polymers with non-self-healing polymeric materials. Puncture healing capability of the melt blends improves at higher temperatures and these thermoplastic materials can repeatedly and intrinsically self-heal without the need for foreign inserts or fillers (such as microencapsulated monomer). The self-healing polymeric materials consisted of Surlyn&reg; 8940, Affinity<sup>TM</sup> EG 8200 G, and poly(butadiene)-graft-poly(methyl acrylate-co-acrylonitrile) or Barex&reg; 210 IN. The non-self-healing polymeric materials consisted of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), LaRC phenyl ethynyl terminated imide 330 (LaRC PETI 330), and Raptor Resins Bismaleimide-1 (BMI-1). Puncture healing blends were also prepared with chopped glass and chopped carbon fibers. The overall goal was to develop a product with superior properties relative to either of the starting materials. The melt blends were prepared in varying compositions to optimize desired properties of the resulting matrix. Ballistic testing was conducted to determine the self-healing characteristics of several developmental polymers subjected to micrometeoroid type damage. These combinations of self-healing polymer materials with high strength polymer resins potentially enables the materials to be used in structural, load bearing applications. Potential applications include: radiation shielding, fuel tank liners, healing layers in ballistic protection for armor, helmets and other personal protective equipment, packaging material, human prosthetics, and wire insulation material.

<DESC><strong>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Cryogenic Current Comparator (CCC) Electronics Package
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: SB1341-18-RQ-0122</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: January 12, 2018</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Tracy Bisson, Contract Specialist, 301-975-3635<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
</strong><strong>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Magnicon GmbH, Barkhausenweg 11, Hamburg, Germany 22339 for the purchase of a CCC Electronics Package for NIST's Quantum Measurement Division (QMD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The NIST QMD develops and disseminate electrical measurement standards in the most accurate and accessible form possible for use in industry and science. In support of this mission, the Division maintains resistance traceability using the quantized Hall resistance (QHR) standard, with intrinsic resistance values given as RH = 25812.807 &#911;/i, where i is a small whole number (typically 2). In order to scale from this fundamental value to other resistance values for calibration services 51100S - 51163C, a specialized resistance bridges known as cryogenic current comparators (CCCs) is required.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is to purchase an additional CCC Electronics system to allow both the NIST probe and the NIST purchased Magnicon CCC Superconducting electronics to be used independently with dedicated electronic and separate computer control. NIST owns a CCC Electronics system for use in the maintenance of the US Ohm and quantum Hall resistance standard.</p>
<p>Magnicon GmbH is the sole reseller for this product. The reason is the new controller hardware and software must be operationally compatible with the wideband feedback requirements of the existing Magnicon CCC Superconducting electronics, and utilize the same winding ratios. This requires the precise control of a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensor to be used to detect the current signal to be generated by the shielded CCC winding. The suppression of noise from the current sources included in this electronics system is difficult, and the Magnicon system is the only commercial system that has successfully demonstrated adequate noise suppression. Other commercially available CCC systems are complete systems which include probe and electronics which are incompatible with the existing Magnicon system. Purchase of a new package to replace all the lab materials would require duplicate costs to the Government. Further, buying these replacement systems cannot provide the flexibility of different measurement ratios that the Magnicon probe and system provide. Magnicon GmbH is the only manufacturer and distributor of the required CCC Electronics package in the world.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern on January 12, 2018. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A NON COMPETITIVE CONTRACT is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules.  The authority for this award is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.
<p>The Chief Information Officer (CIO), Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS), Data Center (DC) provides business services to the Retirement Services (RS), National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), Merit Systems Audit &amp; Compliance (MSAC), Enterprise Human Resource Integration (e-HRI) and other OPM Lines of Business.  Compuware System software is currently being used to manage their applications processing on the IBM Enterprise Servers.  Currently, CIO/EIS/DC seeks renewal of an annual subscription for Compuware software maintenance services.</p>
<p>Compuware software maintenance services entitle DC to new versions of various operating system software products, assistance with identifying and fixing problems 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and the changes necessary to repair any defects found.  This service is critical to enable DC to provide timely resolutions of problems or defects which may be found in the Compuware software applications.</p>
<p>OPM has a requirement for renewal of Compuware software maintenance services.  OPM intends to issue a task order to Compuware Corporation, 1 Campus Martius Fl 4, Detroit, Michigan 48226 to renew software maintenance services for the following:</p>
<p>PRODUCT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Licensed Quantity<br /> Abend-AID for CICS with COBOL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3492 MIPS<br /> Abend-AID with Primary Language - COBOL&nbsp; &nbsp; 3042 MIPS<br /> File-AID/Data Solutions&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3042 MIPS<br /> File-AID/MVS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3042 MIPS<br /> File-AID/RDX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1521 MIPS<br /> Hiperstation for VTAM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1521 MIPS<br /> Xpediter/CICS with COBOL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1521 MIPS<br /> Xpediter/TSO with COBOL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1521 MIPS<br /> Xpediter/Xchange&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1521 MIPS<br /> Thruput Manager&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3500 MIPS</p>
<p>Compuware Corporation is the only known supplier of this proprietary software and the only vendor capable of supporting their products.   It is not the position of OPM that no other firm can perform the work.  OPM deduced that no other offeror could immediately perform all of the services required without incurring substantial unacceptable delay.  Any other contractor would cause OPM schedule risk to provide the required services.</p>
<p><strong>THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO SATISFY THE REQUIRMENTS OF FAR SUBPART 5.2.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</strong> However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered.

A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government.  <strong>All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via e-mail to George T. Carroll, george.carroll@opm.gov, within three days of the published date of this notice.</strong> Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor.

The vendor will provide a base of six months of scientific and technical consulting services support for the Strategic Environmental Research Program (SERDP) and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) with two three month options. The following services are required from the vendor: technical review of proposals and documents; direct support to program areas; administrative and financial support; meeting planning, logistics, and support; and outreach. Competition is not being sought for this requirement. USACE had previously established a single award task order contract (SATOC) with Noblis for these services under W912HQ-16-D-0001, awarded 18 December 2015; however, due to an administrative error, option year 2, for the period 21 Dec 2017 through 20 Dec 2018, was not exercised in a timely manner. Current task orders for services will expire on 14 Jan 2018, and there is insufficient time to conduct a new competitive procurement. The scientific and technical consulting services provided by Noblis are essential to SERDP/ESTCP's daily operations. A lapse in continuous contractor support would result in mission failure.
<p>The period of performance is six months after the date of the award with two, three month option periods.</p>
<p>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. A solicitation will not be posted.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance. This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

<p>Note to the Proposed Contractor:</p>
<p>OIG Exclusion List</p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p>Note to the Proposed Contractor:</p>
<p>OIG Exclusion List</p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p>(b)	The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p><br />(c)</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p><br />(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2)	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3)	The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i)	Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.  Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.<br />This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>Operations Division, Navigation Management Branch is requesting the SV GEORGIA - starboard main propulsion diesel engine service by an authorized Detroit Diesel Marine Dealer/Mechanic.
<p>1.	Point of Contact (POC): (Invoices/Access/Technical)</p>
<p>Jim Bodenrader:  (912) 652-6112     James.A.Bodenrader@usace.army.mil<br />Cone Bostwick/COR:  (912) 210-3580       Cone.S.Bostwick@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>2.	Location: The SV Georgia is located at the USACE Savannah District Depot on Hutchinson Island. The physical address is 99 Grand Prize of America Savannah, Ga. 31421.The contractor will be required to perform the service at this location during USACE working hours, Mon-Fri; 0630-1500.  <br /> <br />3.	Background: SV Georgia- The starboard main propulsion diesel engine was noted to have bubbles in the overflow tank for the cooling jacket water system.  Further testing revealed the cooling jacket water system pressure in excess of 14 PSI, while noting significant pressure increases with increased throttle. Normal system configuration utilizes a 7 PSI vent/vacuum cap. Suspect combustion gas/pressure is entering cooling jacket water. Contractor will inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations for cause, and repair/rebuild.</p>
<p>4.	Period of Performance:  The estimated time for completion is within 28 calendar days after award date of contract. ** Coordination for access and initiation of work should be completed between the contractor and the POCs listed above with 5 calendar days after award date. **</p>
<p>5.	Requirements:  Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations. A modification to the contract may be issued based on the results of the findings, recommendations of the contractor, and approval of USACE.</p>
<p>a.	Task 1: Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations</p>
<p>6.	Engine Information:  <br />SV Georgia <br />a.	Component ID: 06R DETROIT SERIES 60 (STBD)<br />b.	Component Type: DIESEL ENGINE<br />c.	Manufacturer: MTU<br />d.	Model: SERIES 60<br />e.	Port Engine Serial Number: 	06R0767461<br />f.	Application: MARINE</p>
<p>As this is intended as a diagnose and repair service contract it is incumbent of the contractor to address any discovery of other mechanical issues that will need to be addressed, which would prevent a successful test run, in order to return the SV Georgia back into service.  USACE may modify the existing contract or issue a new separate contract solicitation to correct any discovered deficiencies or mechanical issues.</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>1.6.11 Installation Access<br />Based on recent guidance from the Secretary of the Army and COS Army, Senior Commanders and supporting garrison leadership are not authorized to grant unescorted installation access without the required identity proofing and vetting using the National Crime Information Center Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III).</p>
<p>Civilian personnel requesting access must have a valid reason to be on the federal installation, be sponsored by a DoD Civilian/military card holder, and be favorably vetted against the FBI's database. Once these conditions have been met, we will issue credentials in the form of either a pass or DOD identification card from the DBIDS System that we currently have in place. (Defense Biometric Identification System).</p>
<p>Personnel not affiliated with DoD and/or not vetted against NCIC-III or for a short term visit, must escorted while on the installation.</p>
<p>National Crime Information Center Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III) and Terrorist<br />Screening Database (TSDB) Criteria for Denial.</p>
<p>Army Senior Commanders will, in the absence of an approved waiver, deny uncleared individuals unescorted access to the installation based on the results of the NCIC-III and TSDB checks that contain credible derogatory information indicating that the individual may present a threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation. Such derogatory information includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. The NCIC-III contains criminal arrest information about the individual that causes the senior commander to determine that the individual presents a potential threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation.</p>
<p>2. The installation is unable to verify the individuals claimed identity based on the reasonable belief that the individual has submitted fraudulent information concerning his or her identity in the attempt to gain access.</p>
<p>3. The individual has a current arrest warrant in NCIC, regardless of the offense or violation.</p>
<p>4. The individual is currently barred from entry or access to a federal installation or facility.</p>
<p>5. The individual has been convicted of crimes encompassing sexual assault, armed robbery, rape, child molestation, production or possession of child pornography, trafficking humans, drug possession with the intent to sell or drug distribution.</p>
<p>6. The individual has a U.S. conviction for espionage, sabotage, treason, terrorism or murder.</p>
<p>7. The individual is a registered sex offender.</p>
<p>8. The individual has a felony conviction within the last 10 years, regardless of the offense or violation.</p>
<p>9. The individual has been convicted of a felony firearms or explosives violation.<br />10. The individual has engaged in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force.</p>
<p>11. The individual is identified in the TSDB as known to be or suspected of being a terrorist or belonging to an organization with known links to terrorism or support of terrorist activity. When this capability becomes available to DoD, installation access control personnel will strictly follow the Federal Bureau of Investigations published engagement protocols.<br /><br />*Only Government officials whom the senior commander designates will perform fitness determinations. Designations will be in writing by duty position and codified in local guidance.</p>
<p>DBIDS information required to issue passes/cards.</p>
<p>Stateside license, Personal data Ht/Wt/, who the sponsor is, finger print/photo. Before issuing ID cards to new employees or contractors, the standard requires agencies to conduct a background investigation of employees and contractors "who require long-term access to federally controlled facilities and/or information systems." This investigation would include agency initiation of the National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or a similar type of national security investigation. In the event credentials are issued without a completed NACI, the ID must be electronically distinguishable from those issued to individuals for whom the investigation has been completed. The Contractor is responsible for meeting Antiterrorism/Operations Security Requirements. All contractor employees, to include subcontractor employees, requiring access Army installations, facilities and controlled access areas shall complete all mandatory training to include Antiterrorism (AT) and Operations<br />Security (OPSEC) training required by government employees and directed by the command.<br />The contractor and all associated subcontractors' employees shall comply with applicable installation, facility, and area commander installation and facility access and local security policies and procedures (provided by the Government representative). The contractor shall also provide all information required for background checks to meet installation access requirements to be accomplished by the installation Provost Marshal Office, Director of Emergency Services, or Security Office. The contractor workforce must comply with all personal identity verification requirements as directed by DoD, HQDA, and/or local policy. In addition to the changes otherwise authorized by the changes clause of this contract, should the Force Protection<br />Condition (FPCON) at any individual facility or installation change, the Government may require changes in contractor security matters or process.</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br />The Government will utilize a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation method for this requirement. Only those proposals determined to be Technically Acceptable will be eligible for award. Offerors whose technical proposals are determined "Unacceptable" will not be eligible for award. For a proposal to be determined "Technically Acceptable" and receive consideration for award based upon low price submitted, the proposal must receive a rating of "Acceptable" for all factor and sub-factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate the offer and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings</p>
<p>1. The adjectival ratings to be utilized for proposal evaluations are consistent with the DoD Source Selection Procedures and the Army Source Selection Supplement (AS3). A single rating system will be used to evaluate the Technical Acceptability (to include Subfactor 1 and Subfactor 2, as indicated below). Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and will not receive an adjectival rating.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the<br />Solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria consist of three (3) factors. The proposal will be evaluated under the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability<br />Subfactor 1: Staffing Approach<br />Subfactor 2: Relevant Work</p>
<p>Factor 2 Past Performance</p>
<p><br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors.</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1 - Technical Capability. The Technical Capability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror&lsquo;s capability to satisfy the Government&lsquo;s minimum requirements. The Government will evaluate the contractor&lsquo;s technical proposal to ensure that it reflects a sound understanding of this requirement.</p>
<p>Subfactor 1: Staffing Approach. The Government will evaluate the Contractor's understanding of the requirement to provide transportation, commercial bus/motor coach with restroom and a mini bus, each with drivers, are required to transport the participants within 120 - 250 mile radius and surrounding areas. The contractor shall provide vehicles that are safe and visually appropriate (clean, models within 5 years of assembly and within state regulation) for the participants of this event.<br />Subfactor 2: Relevant work. The Government will evaluate the provided relevant work Contract numbers or orders number; brief description of work; the first and last name of the point of contact to confirm the performance of work; e-mail address and phone number of that individual that issued the contract or order. The Government will review and validate performance of relevant work with the information provided under this sub factor.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 2 - Price. The Price Submission will not be scored or rated. The techniques and procedures described under FAR Part 15.404-1(b) will be the primary means of assessing Price analysis for commercial items to determine price reasonableness. To be viable for award, an Offeror's price must be determined fair and reasonable and not exceed the established fair market price in accordance with FAR 19.807. The Offeror's total proposed price will be utilized to evaluate if the proposal represents a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The TEP to be used for the determination of price reasonableness will be calculated as follows: The sum of all CLINs.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Unbalanced pricing will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i) (1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k) (1) or (k) (2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k) (3) (i) of this clause.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 Of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br /><br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<DESC>RE:  36C26118Q0200, Amendment A00001
This amendment is issued to address a question received in response to the solicitation. 
Questions (Q) and Answers (A):
Q1. In the cost price schedule of supplies and services section of the solicitation, it says that a 3 pivot arm is necessary for conformance. I would assume that it is referring to the monitor containing apparatus? Also, for the dual monitors, you ll require 2-three pivot arms per table?
A1. There is only one pivot arm to support either a single bracket for one monitor or two brackets to support two monitors. The pivot arm attaches to the desk through an access hole in the back of the sit-stand desktop.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this

registered in that NAICS prior to receipt of quote in order to receive an
award. Offeror are reminded that failure to comply â€œshall render their quote

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA is seeking interest from the small business community for possible set-aside of all or part of the procurement. Responses are desired from any/all eligible small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. 

FAA anticipates that any resultant contract will be a Fixed-Price contract.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, in particular service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the required items. 

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.

The scope of work consists of:

1.	The Contractor to sub contract a 3rd party Industrial Hygienist as the Environmental Consultant.
2.	The Contractor to provide pdf shop drawings for review.
3.	FAA to mark existing underground utilities.
4.	Contractor to remove and store contents from the facility in a contractor provided shelter.
5.	The Contractor or their Sub-contractor shall remove interior asbestos containing floor mastic and dispose of at a state approved hazardous waste facility. See Attached Survey.

<p>The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment and supervision required for the construction described.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $36.5M.</p>
<p>A site visit will be held December 14, 2017 at 11:00 am (Date and Time subject to change), at the project site near Delta Junction, Alaska. Bidders are asked to RSVP the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm Alaska time on December 13, 2017, if they will be attending the site visit.</p>
<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Contracting Services Branch (CSB) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Remediation of the Delta-Clearwater project near Delta Junction, Alaska. The project site is located approximately 2 miles south of the Alaska Highway at Milepost 1408 which is approximately 14 miles east of Delta Junction.
<p>This job consists of re-grading the Delta-Clearwater project site to near pre-project (1998) conditions and stabilizing the disturbed area with woody debris and planting of live woody materials. The work involves placement of approximately 400,000 cubic yards of earthfill, 90 acres of topsoiling, 110 acres of woody debris placement and hydroseeding, 3000 cubic yards of riprap stabilization, and 55 acres of tree and shrub planting and live staking. Topsoil and woody debris materials must be located by the contractor and are not available on-site. The topsoiling material will provide an excellent medium and seed source for plants to re-inhabit the site. On the surface a random placement of "woody debris" will cover the entire project site. The purpose of the woody debris is to create microclimates conducive to plant growth and to help break up minor flow concentrations that may develop. GPS machine control will be required on the compaction equipment and any equipment involved in final grading and all topsoiling work.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $36.5M. The Product Service Code is Z2QA.</p>
<p>This project is being solicited as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) using the sealed bidding procedures of FAR Part 14. Mobilization to the site is anticipated to commence about March 15, 2018 or as soon as conditions allow. Actual project construction is anticipated to commence about May 1, 2018, with a required completion date of September 30, 2018. A pre-bid site showing will be held December 14, 2017 at 11:00 am (Date and Time subject to change), at the project site near Delta Junction, Alaska. Bidders are asked to RSVP the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm Alaska time on December 13, 2017, if they will be attending the site visit.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Total Small Business set-aside. The full solicitation package including specifications and drawings will be available from the Federal Business Opportunities website on or around December 7, 2017. A public bid opening will be held on or around January 10, 2018. Interested contractors must be registered in and must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov in order to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>For further information, contact Ryan Lorimer, Contracting Officer, via email at ryan.lorimer@wdc.usda.gov or via telephone at 907-761-7744.</p>

Companies interested in the anticipated RFP should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov for the release of the RFP.
The CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.
The technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.  Additionally, access to classified information up to and including Top Secret is anticipated. All necessary security measures will be followed, and will be identified on the CSRR C&M DD Form 254 should procurement take place.
Specification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non- Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil) entitled, "Bidder's Repository NDA" and provide the e-mail address and phone number for up to two users to Anna Kurzeja, anna.kurzeja@navy.mil.  Each company must also provide a copy of a fully executed DoD DD Form-2345 "Military Critical Technical Data Agreement".  If the company does not have an active DD 2345 on file and cannot provide a Joint Certification Program (JCP) number, please visit DLIS at:  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for more information on how to complete and submit the DD 2345.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA - issued PKI certificate, contact Kymberlee Boisvert for further instruction at kymberlee.boisvert@navy.mil.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.
Questions and comments regarding the specification documents are requested to be submitted no later than 26 May 2017. Questions and comments are requested to be submitted in writing via e-mail only to: Anna Kurzeja, Contract Specialist, SPAWAR 2.1B19, (anna.kurzeja@navy.mil).  Verbal questions and comments will not be accepted. The Government will provide public answers to all questions and comments received regarding the specification documents and anticipated RFP via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  All questions and comments shall be in a format non-attributable to the company or individual submitting the questions or comments to allow for public release.
The Government anticipates issuing a Cost type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330-Engineering Services.
The estimated date for solicitation release is January 2018.

Ft.:  4714<br />Maximum ABOA Sq. Ft.:  5185<br />Space Type: Office<br />Term: Up to 15 Years<br />Agency Specific Requirements:
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 17-REG03. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with RLP 17-REG03 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease. All documents can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed.
