While Reclamation maintains the ultimate responsibility for the operation and maintenance of Jamestown Dam and Reservoir, the Government has delegated the administration of the reservoir's recreation management to the Stutsman County Park Board.

<DESC>The Department's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) is seeking a company capable of implementing OSERS' second Center to Improve Project Performance whose primary mission is to provide technical assistance to OSEP-funded projects on their formative and summative project evaluations.  CIPP has the following goals: (1) to inform and promote high quality formative and summative project evaluations and performance reporting as conducted by OSEP-funded projects or their external evaluators; (2) to improve the consistency, objectivity and rigor of OSEP's 3+2 evaluations of projects funded at approximately $500,000 or more annually; and (3) to complete the work of the first CIPP on the summative evaluations of eleven projects funded from FY 2008-FY 2011.
<p><br />The general TA task in this procurement is expanded to include the development of up to 2 broad-based TA activities per year (in addition to an annual conference presentation at the OSEP Project Director's Meeting) that can provide evaluation information to a large number of interested parties.  Moreover, intensive TA for OSEP's larger investments shall continue for this procurement, but the focus of future work with these projects will shift from improving summative evaluation to formative evaluations.  This includes the projects' participation in the 3+2 process that evaluates the progress of OSEP's large discretionary investments in implementing their activities.  This award will also require the contractor to improve the rigor and consistency of the 3+2 process in general.</p>
<p><br />Please note that this is a technical assistance contract.  The contractor does not conduct the evaluations or collect evaluation data; though, in order to complete some tasks described herein, the contractor may analyze evaluation data collected by a grantee.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that an unrestricted full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on April 8, 2013.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  A contract with a base year plus 4 twelve month option years is anticipated.  The award date for the procurement is planned to be no later than June 29, 2013.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Keyence Corp of America, 669 River Drive, Suite 403 Elmwood Park, NJ 07407 for a Fluorescence microscope.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>NCI is currently developing new imaging modalities to study physiological responses of tumors and normal tissues to radiation and chemotherapy drugs. In order to correlate biochemical processes studied with our in vivo imaging program we must also remove and section both tumor and normal tissue for analysis by immunochemistry methods. Since imaging studies the whole tissue and not just one small part of the tissue NCI must be able to analyze by immunochemistry a large area of the tissue observed in vivo. At magnifications used by most fluorescence and light microscopes usually only small parts of tissue may be analyzed at one time and this area must be carefully stitched together for complete analysis. The Keyence microscope has integrated its microscope to collect multiple sections from a tissue and stitch them together to get a complete picture of the magnified tissue studied. In this manner multiple biochemical and molecular markers may be studied and correlated with our in vivo imaging studies.</p>
<p>NCI has found the Keyence microscope to be unique in several ways. First, the Keyence microscope uses multiple objectives to achieve the desired image magnification for stitching images together. Second, the Keyence microscope has an enclosed imaging scanning stage which allows the unit to occupy a small space in the laboratory. This is vital as other microscopes require rooms where lights must be controlled. Finally, the Keyence microscope has been engineered to rapidly scan slides using different excitation and emission wavelengths, and stitching and overlaying these images together for a complete analysis of the tissue sections studied. The Keyence microscope has been optimized for rapid scanning for multiple wavelengths to stitch together a large number of frames for views of an entire section of tissue. It is the belief of NCI that this is a sole source requirement for Keyence Corp.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 5, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240)&nbsp;276-5401 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130050-EB on all correspondence.</p>

Phase I will invite offerors to submit White Papers describing technical approach, experience, capabilities and past performance with a cost estimate in the selected technology improvement areas.  The selection of White Papers to continue through to Phase II of this process will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost estimates provided in the White Papers, in view of the availability of funds.  The complete BAA including preparation instructions, technical point of contact, and evaluation criteria are found in the attachments as well as details regarding the first Industry Day scheduled for 16 April 2013.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored. Any response to this notice must accompany details expressing clear and convincing evidence of prospective contractors Experience, Capability and Capacity to perform this requirement. This requirement is in its infant stage of development; therefore the information collected is for market research.

<p>The Department of State (DOS) will launch the solicitation on FedBizOpps (FBO) website.

The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work as required in the contract. The estimated number of annual hours for guards is 66,200 and consists of 13 posts. Major duties and responsibilities are to perform access control to limit entry to only authorized personnel or visitors, the operation of walk-through metal detectors, hand-held detectors and special monitoring devices. These requirements may change depending on mission needs during the awarded periods of performance. The Government anticipates awarding a single contract with a period of performance for one Base Year (12-Months) and four one-year periods at the option of the Government.</p>
<p>The DOS solicits responses to this notice from all sources to include small businesses (including small businesses in all socio-economic categories) teaming agreements, and joint ventures with the experience, capacity and capability to perform Local Guard Services for Port Moresby.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), intends to issue a sole source contract to ESO Solutions, 9020 N. Capital of Texas Highway, Suite II-300, Austin, TX 78759 to purchase license, travel, training and ongoing support for ESO's ePCR (electronic Patient Care Record) system software, by other than full and open competition, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <strong>This is not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.<br /></strong><br />The licenses are for existing ePCR software that was designed by ESO Solutions. The ePCR system software provides the single point of EMS/paramedic patient care record across all DHS. All DHS components with EMS/paramedic personnel have been issued system access and training opportunity. Continuation of this license will allow DHS to seamlessly continue to consolidate all patient records under one system. The existing software is proprietary and only ESO may grant the license and support the system. The Certification and Accreditation process took two years to complete after contract award to satisfy the new regulations implemented by the DHS Office of the Chief Information Office (OCIO) that all systems used by DHS regardless of the dollar threshold must be approved by OCIO before implementation. A reconfiguration of the ePCR system was requested by the OCIO in order to meet the C&amp;A requirements and DHS use of the system. This resulted in a DHS instance of the ePCR system. Additionally, the contract had to be reconfigured in order to accommodate the cost incurred for these changes. The ceiling of the contract had to be increased by 10% and the period of performance was decreased by two one-year option periods. It is anticipated that a new patient care record system, if acquired under a re-compete, would undergo similar reviews and scrutiny, which would require substantial time and cost to the Government.<br /><br />Since ESO owns the software license, a new vendor cannot come in and start operating the system. A re-compete of the services would create a negative impact to the Government and an administrative burden; thus, it would be more costly and not in the Government's best interest not to award a sole source contract to ESO Solutions.<br /><br />A redacted copy of the justification prepared for this procurement will follow at a later date pursuant to the requirements of FAR 5.102(a)(6). Based on the aforementioned facts and the statutory authority at FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award a single non-competitive contract to ESO Solutions for these licenses after March 28, 2013.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis <br> Basic Ordering Agreement <br> RFP# W912DY-13-R-0007 <br> NAICS 334111 - Electronic Computer Manufacturing <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is soliciting proposals on an unrestricted basis for Technology Insertion (TI) under solicitation W912DY-13-R-0007.  In order to accomplish this mission, CEHNC proposes to award multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs), in accordance with FAR 16.703, to all qualified offerors who exhibit the required technical capabilities and past performance for this requirement.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately thirty 30 days after the release of this announcement. <br>  <br> Requirement: <br>  <br> The HPCMP continues to enhance its ability to support DOD and the warfighter through the acquisition of balanced HPC systems for five (5) DOD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) and multiple Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs).  Under the proposed BOAs for TI, the contractors (who must be Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)) will provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and non-personal services necessary to provide sustainable, state-of-the-art, HPC capability for the DOD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) community. This capability will be introduced through a series of technology insertions (TIs) in direct support of the DOD HPCMP's mission - to accelerate the development and transition of advanced defense technologies into superior warfighting capabilities by exploiting and strengthening U.S. leadership in supercomputing, communications, and computational modeling.  <br>  <br> The offerors will deliver balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC systems, which contain an appropriate combination of processor, memory, disk I/O, interconnect, and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to conduct complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations. Salient system attributes include: <br>   A reasonably high byte to floating point operation (FLOP) count ratio (when comparing peak CPU memory bandwidth to peak CPU floating point capability); <br>   2GB to 3GB of memory capacity per computational core; <br>   At least 50GB/s, 50GB/s, and 75GB/s of read, write, and full duplex bandwidth, respectively, between the compute and I/O subsystems for every 1,000 computational nodes in the system; <br>   At least 20GB per core, 20GB per core, and 0.5GB per core of formatted usable disk storage for /work1, /work2, and /home (respectively); <br>   A tightly integrated interconnect with:  <br>   o Each link having at least 40Gb/s of network bandwidth;  <br>   o An end-to-end latency that is less than 5 s (five microseconds);  <br>   A well-tuned OS with low jitter <br> Evaluation Criteria Overview: <br> Each offeror will be evaluated for technical capability and past performance and will be rated as  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  or  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark .  BOAs will be established with offerors who receive an  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  rating in the following evaluation categories: <br> 1.	Technical <br> a.	American Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) status <br> b.	Technical capability  <br> c.	Administration and maintenance  <br> 2.	Past performance  <br> a.	Recent and relevant past performance <br> b.	Past performance questionnaires and interviews <br> It is estimated the program requirements for this action will total $330M over a five (5) year period.  The BOAs will be reviewed annually. In addition, an annual pre-solicitation notice will be issued to provide the projected requirements for the upcoming year. At that time, new firms may submit proposals to join the BOA pool. Once BOAs are established, it is the Government's intent to solicit only those firms holding a BOA for this requirement; however, this does not preclude other firms from submitting proposals.  Each Order RFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps through the Army's Single Face to Industry (AFSI) portal for public awareness. All orders will be solicited on a Firm Fixed Price basis. All proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with established criteria unique to each order requirement.  The BOA itself is not a contract.  The orders against the BOA will become binding contracts upon award. <br> The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offeror's are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider past performance data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of applicability rests with the offeror. This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about 15 April 2013  <br>  <br> Note: Response Date referenced under General Information does not refer to the proposal due date. The estimated BOA Proposal Due Date is 15 May 2013, and the official due date will be stated in the solicitation. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> USACE HNC, Huntsville, P. O.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) was established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since 1813, depository libraries have safeguarded the public's right to know by collecting, organizing, maintaining, preserving, and assisting users with information from the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FDLP provides Government information at no cost to designated depository libraries throughout the country and territories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These depository libraries, in turn, provide local, no-fee access to Government information in an impartial environment with professional assistance.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;As institutions committed to equity of access and dedicated to free and unrestricted public use, the nation's nearly 1,250 depository libraries serve as one of the vital links between "We the people" and our Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyone can visit Federal depository libraries and use the Federal depository collections which are filled with information on careers, business opportunities, consumer information, health and nutrition, legal and regulatory information, demographics, and numerous other subjects.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Requirement Background &amp; Current Situation</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong>At present, our main distribution system is an Oracle-based content system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The GPO is exporting data files that contain library profiles which equate the publications selected by each depository library in the FDLP program.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;Each of the 1250 depository libraries have the ability to select and de-select item numbers that are associated with government publications distributed by GPO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These library selection profiles are housed in the Oracle application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When government publications are produced, they are provided a classification number and item number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the selection profile, the item number is queried todetermine if the item number is in the particular profile, and the item is inserted into a shipment box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The GPO creates a general shipping list that has all titles received in a given period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shipping list is used as a guide for distribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shipping list identifies the title, classification number, and the Item number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(All libraries may not get all items on the shipping list).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPO is using a paper print form from our ORACLE database which provided a listing of selected depository libraries for a given item number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sample attached.)</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;Overall, the GPO has had a good return on investment from the system, though there are a number of ongoing issues.</p>

<DESC>RFI - General Support Contracting Center Afghanistan
<p>The General Support Contracting Center has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication that GSCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov and Joint Contracting and Contingency Contracting Services website https://www.jccs.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement. This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future Solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government's requirement is to obtain a non-personnel services contract to provide time focused, specific training, mentoring and technical assistance to all the identified positions in each Provincial Joint Secretariat Team (PJST) and to the Provincial Peace Councils (PPC) Chairman &amp; Secretary in order to improve organizational effectiveness. <br />The provider shall be capable of delivering capacity development skills and knowledge as described in this PWS. Organizational capacity development and training must be closely linked to required functions and processes detailed in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP) and Joint Secretariat (JS) source documents in order to guarantee the success of APRP writ large. The training regimen provided under this contract is intended to not only address core activities identified previously, but also consider their coherence within the broader program context, taking into account external actors, factors and information flows to optimize the sequencing of capacity development activities in order to achieve desired organizational capacity development objective end state. <br />The contractor shall deliver a standardized logical framework approach for the design, development and implementation, and delivery of capacity development training. Capacity development training will be rapidly delivered in a national and semi-regional platform over the duration of the program July 2013 to June 2014. The contractors approach must contain flexibility, adaptability and account for changing opportunities and dynamics typical within Afghanistan.<br />The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contractor performing the services herein. A draft performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) that might result from this survey would have a period of performance of a base year and 4 option years. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $30M.</p>
<p>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the GSCC Capacity Development Program requirements. We recommend that you first review the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) so that you may have a better insight on the questions below.</p>
<p>(1) What are commercial practices for providing these types of services for non-governmental entities?</p>
<p>(2) Can a prime contractor provide a system to support Capacity Development Training Services within Afghanistan under one contract? If not, what do you recommend?</p>
<p>(3) What type of personnel (i.e., labor category) will the prime contractor use to perform these services?</p>
<p>(4) The Government contemplates having the right to conduct on-site inspections of any of the prime contractor's facilities. Is this considered a customary industry practice?</p>
<p>(5) Can a contractor maintain a network of trailing facilities, located in areas of Afghanistan, that are considered to be dangerous?</p>
<p>(6) What is the most cost effective contract type and payment method (i.e., monthly firm fixed-price, separate price per service (price list), cost reimbursement, or combination, etc.)?</p>
<p>(7) Are there normally any special terms or conditions or unique contract structure associated with a contract requiring a contractor to deliver capacity development training as outlined within the Performance Based Work Statement?</p>
<p>(10) The capacity development training is required within the country of Afghanistan. What would be the best way for a competing contractor to structure their pricing for these services? Explain why?</p>
<p>(11) Is 30 days a sufficient amount of time for a contractor to prepare a proposal given the scenario of a Lowest Price Technical Acceptable Solicitation? If 30 days is not sufficient, please provide a reasonable time frame to prepare a proposal and rationale for your time frame.</p>
<p>(12) Please describe your experience or recommended solution for those training services found within the Performance Based Work Statement.</p>
<p>(13) Are there standard commercial rates for these types of services? Can prices be standardized across Afghanistan?</p>

<DESC><p>DFAS seeks an Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance (EGRC) solution, by adopting the frameworks from the Open Compliance &amp; Ethics Group (OCEG), also known as the "OCEG Red Book, GRC Capability Model," and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework. Furthermore, according to the GAO-08-904T report, recognizing that risk management helps policymakers make informed decisions, Congress and the administration have charged federal agencies to use a risk-based approach to prioritize resource investments. As a result, GAO has developed a risk management framework, based on industry best practices and other criteria. This framework, divides risk management into five major phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the appropriate alternatives; and (5) implementing the alternatives and monitoring the progress made and results achieved.</p>
<p>All three frameworks integrate and include models for governance and assurance; management of performance; and risk and compliance, to help design and implement an effective enterprise-wide approach to risk management, and will support DFAS' effort to produce and sustain documentation required to satisfy common deliverable requirements for audit readiness, which include customer audit assertions, Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16, and other Federal requirements to support the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2010.</p>
<p>Ultimately, DFAS seeks an EGRC solution to provide a common framework to capture an enterprise view of governance, risk, and compliance activities throughout the agency by adopting and standardizing the frameworks into the MICP to ultimately report its efficiencies and effectiveness of internal controls through the annual SoA process.</p>
<p>Additionally, DFAS is in search of an application that can interface with existing DFAS tools and information libraries to capture, track, and report on various monitoring initiatives, control frameworks, and training programs to provide DFAS with the ability to link risk and controls to internal and external regulations; correlate laws and regulations relevant to DFAS with internal policies, procedures, and compliance activities; enable risk management and minimize operational complexity; and, provide the opportunity to adopt best business practices and standardize processes when and where possible.</p>

The U.S. Navy is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having both interest and the resources to support additional FY13 LCAC SLEP requirements.
   LCACs have been operational for an average of 25 years.  As they reach the end of their extended operational service life, shortfalls will exist in ship-to-shore lift capabilities.  This will exacerbate the inherent challenges and limitations of supporting ship-to-shore movement and operations across the Range of Military Operations. 

The Government is considering increasing the quantity of craft previously identified in Request for Proposal (RFP) N00024-13-R-2400 from a total of two to a base of two craft and an option for two additional craft (total of four craft, if all options are exercised.)  This market research will contribute to the identification of potential bidders for FY13 LCAC SLEP procurement should the quantity be increased.

This request for information is seeking business sources in the United States capable of performing LCAC SLEP effort at Assault Craft Unit 4 (ACU 4), Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek, VA.
  The type of work to be accomplished includes repair and installation of hull structures, machinery, electrical systems, electronics, and piping systems.  Integration of Government Furnished Property (GFP)  (e.g. LCAC unique cable, the C4N suite and ETF40B gas turbine engines) into the craft utilizing a mature build-to-print Technical Data Package (TDP) is also required.  The TDP consists of work items and associated drawings, test procedures, technical manuals, and a GFP list for each craft.

Interested parties shall respond to this announcement with a notice of interest, via email, to the Point of Contact listed below no later than 1600 EDT on 27 March 2013.  

No later than 1600 EDT, 29 March 2013, interested business sources who previously provided a notice of interest in response to this Sources Sought shall submit the following informational response, via email only, to the Point of Contact listed below.
  Informational responses should be limited to two (2) pages.  Telephonic responses are not acceptable.  The informational responses shall contain unclassified information only and include the following:

1.	Company Information
(1)	Organization Name, Mailing Address  and Website Address
(2)	Point of Contact 
i.	Name 
ii.	Position/Title
iii.	Email address
iv.	Telephone number
2.	Capabilities and expected ability to meet LCAC SLEP requirements as referenced above
3.	Past experience performing construction and modernization of vessels of similar dimensions and characteristics highlighting: 
(1)	Construction and modernization - 
i.	Organic or subcontracted?
ii.	Teaming arrangement?
(2)	Familiarity with Government contract requirements
i.	Give examples of successful Government contracts of similar scope of work

NOTE:  Should no party other than the current LCAC SLEP incumbent provide a notice of interest, the Government will proceed with a synopsis for this effort as a sole-source procurement.

NOTICES REGARDING SOLICITATION:  This request for information does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment, implied or otherwise, by the Government that a procurement action will be issued.
  No telephone inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not be honored, as no solicitation is intended at this time.  Response to this notice is not a request to be added to a bidders list or to receive a copy of a solicitation.

The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this request for information or information provided as a result of this request.  Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this notice is strictly voluntary.  

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of Contractor's information.

NOTICE REGARDING PROPRIETARY INFORMATION: All submitted materials will be designated for Government Use Only.  Third party support contractors who have executed non-disclosure agreements may have access to the information provided.  Any information submitted which is to be provided and reviewed by Government personnel only shall be clearly marked as such.

The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Human Resources and Administration (OHR&A), Veterans Employment Service Office (VESO) is a strategic program management office that oversees all VA Veteran employment initiatives and manages the program branded as "VA for Vets", its flagship initiative.  The VESO was created in response to Presidential Executive Order 13518. The VESO mission is to create a world-class organization of Veterans serving Veterans.  VESO wants Veterans to embrace VA as being the employer of choice.  VA established the goal of increasing VA's Veteran employment rate to 40% by FY 2014 with an interim goal of 35% by the end of 2013.  

VA for Vets is a comprehensive career support and management program for Veterans, National Guard, Reserve members, VA employees who are Veterans, and transitioning active-duty service members, hereinafter referred to as VA for Vets provides centralized access to training, coaching, communications and career development tools for Military Service Members, supervisors, coworkers and the human resource (HR) professionals who support them at VA.

VESO provides employment counseling, career assessments, assistance drafting competitive resumes, assistance developing job search strategies, direct job placement assistance, and Career and Reintegration coaches through its Coaching Call Centers and virtual career center. The Coaching Call Centers are currently staffed by coaches and Veteran Representatives that have backgrounds in Human Resources and psychology and are experts in the Federal hiring process.  
VA for Vets also provides training services for both the Veteran and VA staff through Instructor Lead, and web based methodologies. In order for VESO to achieve its retention and recruitment objectives, there is need for the proper training and increased engagement with the Veteran and HR professionals and hiring managers. Training runs the life cycle from recruitment, retention, to deployment and reintegration.  

Since the launch November 11, 2011, the VA for Vets has collected the following metrics: 

VA For Vets Activity (11/11/11 - 2/28/13)
Registered Accounts in CMS	74,022
Total Visits to the website	993,822
Career Center Visits	136,123
Total Resumes in CMS	45,040
Call Center - Inbound Calls, Coaching	32,938

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INDUSTRY DAY <br />FOR MINIATURIZED CRYPTO SOLUTIONS </strong></p>
<p>Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD), COMSEC Products Branch (HNCC), Joint Base San Antonio - Lackland, Texas, will be conducting an Industry Day on 27-28 February 2013 in San Antonio, Texas. AFLCMC/HNCC requests industry provide information on Suite B based, NSA Type 1 (available and under development) certified or certifiable Miniaturized Cryptographic (MC) devices for Secret and Below information protection. The cryptographic device will need to be capable of meeting highly optimized Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints while supporting modest data throughput. AFLCMC/HNCC envisions MC to be an embeddable module, however alternate solutions may be considered for installation. Embedment/installation will be required to operate within a system employing advanced electronic technology. Capabilities to provide such a device should be briefed with respect to the attached draft system requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL INFORMATION<br /></span>Industry Days will be held on 27 &amp; 28 February 2013 (vendors will only participate in one of the two days). Schedules for each day will be provided to vendors once they RSVP for the event. During each session, the Government will brief background information, provide existing draft system requirements, and allow for questions and answers. Each company is restricted to two representatives maximum and any prime may include potential subcontractors within the two representatives. Questions and answers discussed during the Industry Day will be made available on FedBizOps approximately two weeks after the Industry Days.</p>
<p>Upon request, individual sessions with the Government will be made available and consist of at most a 40 minute timeframe. Any respondent's presentation should be no more than 30 minutes in length with the remainder of the time spent on questions and answers. Respondents are reminded that during the individual sessions all questions and Government answers that are not specific to a respondent's solution will be posted to FedBizOps. The Government is interested in any inputs or comments from the respondents to the capabilities and questions identified in the previous RFI MINICRYPTO11212012. The Government is also interested in any input or comment on the method of contracting and contract types as well as an understanding of vendor concerns. If a respondent chooses to request an individual session, individual unclassified presentations must be e-mailed in advance to the appropriate Government POCs. Please note that USB type devices are not authorized. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">1) What is your recommendation for a standard MC/host interface which would facilitate ease of embedment and comply with other MC requirements, such as size, weight, power, and data rates?</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2) For your MC solution, what is your projected Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)<a name="_GoBack"></a> (mean time to replace a failed MC device in a host)?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you have devices similar to MC, what are your MTBF and MTTR for these devices?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3) What is the expected repair capability of the component(s)?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4) What support or special test equipment will be required for sustainment/operational checkout?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5) Do you think long lead items will need to be purchased in order to produce these devices?</span></p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer N. Henley, Phone 202 283-1670, Fax 202-283-1533, Email jennifer.n.henley@irs.gov
<DESC><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to add and purchase CA Inc's extended support software maintenance and supplementary support services for its current CA SiteMinder licenses to the IRS's existing CA BPA TIRNO11Z00027 pending the Subject To Availability of Funds. This extended support is being offered and purchase as maintenance as a product.</p>
<p>PART NUMBER: ESBSTM990, Description: CA SiteMinder&reg; Web Access Manager Extended Support, Quantity: 1</p>
<p>The period of performance for this extended support will be April 1, 2013 - September 30, 2014. The period of performance for the supplementary support services is April 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014 with a six month option period of April 1, 2014 - September 30, 2014 to coincide with the extended support.</p>
<p>This order will be made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government anticipates the value of the award to be $492,259.00.</p>
<p>Justification for other than full and open competition - Only One Source Rationale: "This is an only one responsible source JOFOC for the extended support software maintenance for existing CA SiteMinder software licenses and professional services for custom modules. The existing version of the IRS's CA SiteMinder software maintenance end of life is expiring March 31, 2013. In order for the IRS to continue to receive software maintenance for its SiteMinder products this additional supplemental support must be purchased. Without the support, the IRS will not receive upgrades, patches, fixes or technical support. The lack of support would jeopardize the success of the current tax season and next year's tax season. The IRS will not be able to transfer to an upgraded version of the SiteMinder license until October 1, 2014. CA only sells the extended support in this 18 month increment.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Modernization Program requires a modernized infrastructure. The infrastructure provides a combination of custom software modules and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware and security solutions, integrated to form the technical foundation for modernization. The components are consistent with the technical architecture for modernization as envisioned in the Modernization Blueprint and further defined in the Enterprise Architecture (EA). eTrust SiteMinder is an integral component of this infrastructure and provides the following functionality: Single Sign-On, Centralized Security Policy Server, Enterprise Manageability, Federated Identity Support, Open and Extensible eTrust.<sup>TM</sup> SiteMinder&reg; is a market-leading, security and management foundation for enterprise Web applications with a centralized security infrastructure for managing user authentication and access. eTrust SiteMinder delivers the market's most advanced security management capabilities and enterprise-class site administration, reducing overall IT operational cost and complexity. eTrust SiteMinder enables the secure delivery of essential information and applications to employees, partners, suppliers and customers, and scales with growing business needs. For Modernization, SiteMinder authenticates users accessing the IRS's modernized applications through the Web Portals environment and authorizes them to use the back-end servers and data stores at pre-defined levels as determined by the Mission Assurance (MA) staff."</p>
<p>The IRS had identified CA Inc as the only source for CA's extended support for the SiteMinder licenses. CA sent the IRS a letter, dated March 5, 2013, that stated CA is only the available source for the extended support as it does not let its authorized resellers sell the extended support.</p>
<p>The notice will of intent to award to CA, Inc will be posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.<br />The Contracting Officer will determine the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted via the internet and telephone contacts. It was determined that CA does not sell this extended support software maintenance on GSA FSS or NASA SEWP.</p>
<p>No sources expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>This extended support will not be required after September 30, 2014 and the IRS will be able after the SiteMinder version is updated to purchase standard software maintenance which is already included in the BPA.</p>
<p>The Contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Any other responsible sources who believe they can provide the required products may submit a written capability statement, via email, by 12 pm ET on March 26, 2013. Telephone inquiries will be considered non-responsive. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. If no responses are received the award will be made to CA, Inc.</p>

<a href="mailto:cynthia.w.maclean@nasa.gov">Cynthia W. Maclean</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Advanced Technology & Integration Contract (ATIC). The nature of the work anticipated under the ATIC may create a situation where there could be the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the ATIC. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the ATIC will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.     -A conflict based on impaired objectivity is created when a contractors judgment and objectivity in performing the contract requirements may be impaired due to the fact that the substance of the contractors performance has the potential to affect other interests of the contractor. This conflict contains two elements  the use of subjective judgment by the contractor and whether a contractor has a financial interest in the outcome of its performance. A conflict could be created when a contractors judgment and objectivity in performing ATIC may be impaired due to the fact that the substance of its performance has the potential to affect a part of its interests on Facilities Development Operations Contract (FDOC). See Attachment A for an example from ATIC.     -A conflict based on unfair access to data could be created when there is unequal access to information when a contractor has access to nonpublic information which may provide the firm an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract. Conflicts based on unequal access to information for ATIC can best correlate to obtaining access to proprietary information. See Attachment B for an example from ATIC. A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to the ATIC procurement website at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/atic    .	Please reference that document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCI issues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this synopsis.  Your response is requested by 2:00 p.m. local time on March 29, 2013.  Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions:      1. What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the ATIC contract?      2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.     3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed ATIC contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)?     4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the ATIC that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential ATIC RFP? NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerors proposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigation strategy in writing.  NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examine possible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be a confirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror can successfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters or interprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to an RFP issued under a solicitation for ATIC.  Subsequent to the initial submission and response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.	NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submitted it.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information or with similar restrictive markings will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  All questions should be directed to the point of contact identified below.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.	The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited under this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Small Business Administration, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a non-competitive, sole source follow-on contract with NewWorldApps, Inc. for the continuation of the SBA hosting sites for SBA's Office of Communications and Public Liaison, providing physical infrastructure (hardware), operating system and software servers, in addition to professional services, for one year. SBA's investment to date cannot be recovered within this one year time frame of this sole source order if it were to be competed competively; it has been determined that more than five years would be required to recover these investment costs. The knowledge NewWorldApps, Inc. possesses cannot be replicated without a substantial duplication of cost and effort, one which will result in delays and potential service interruptions, which will adversely impact the delivery of both products and services to SBA and its customers. This procurement is authorized in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1), and is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with one responsible source under the authority of FAR 6.303-2(b)(12). The previous competitive acquisition was conducted for these same commercial services. Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement via email to barbara.hayden@sba.gov by close of business Tuesday, March 26, 2013. Telephone requests will not be honored. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed order based on the responses to this notice will be based solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. </span></span></p>

Deliveries will be to various DLA Direct locations within the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).&nbsp;While price is a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance.<br /><br />The Contracting Officer MAY utilize online Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under the solicitation. During the course of the online auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors&nbsp;and anyone else having access to the online auction. The public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offerors' identity will be concealed from the other offerors (although will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g. "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and the final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br /><br />Solicitation issue date is March 25, 2013 and the response date is April 8, 2013. Copies of this solicitation will be available on the DIBBS website listed above, but your response MUST be sent directly to the Contract Specialist listed on page 4 of the solicitation. You are not able to submit a quote directly to DIBBS.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875
Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to:

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. The requirement will be issued by Department of Veteran Affairs, Medical Center, San Antonio TX (VAMC San Antonio). This combined synopsis/solicitation serves as a request for quote (RFQ) for Way Radio Communication Signal Enhancement System   . The solicitation document, incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-62. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334220.


Only electronic submission will be accepted, offeror must include, CCR Registration, Tax ID, and reference.  Solicitation Number in Subject line of e-mail. 


Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center 2-Way Radio Communication Signal Enhancement System   
3.  Background.  
The Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center operates a multi-repeater Motorola Smartzone Trunked radio system to support communications between handheld radios within the hospital facility. 
The radio system propagates signals through an antenna system mounted on the roof of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center building. 
The system operates on specific frequencies between 409 MHz and 420 MHz. 
The site/system is part of the San Antonio DOD/VA SARTS network but the connection to this system is not relevant to this project. 
Prior to the installation of this site, Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center installed a bi-directional amplifier system to propagate signals within the Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center structure from transmitters located at Lackland AFB and/or Wilford Hall USAF Hospital. The condition of this amplifier is unknown but it is believed to be non-functional or poorly functional. This BDA/DAS was not designed to propagate signals from the existing radio infrastructure at Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center and, therefore, should not be considered a functional part of the existing radio system. 
A recent site survey indicates signal propagation on the First Level and Ground Level of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center is too weak to reliably support communications in many areas of these levels. 
Previous evaluations have indicated poor to no coverage from the trunked radio site in newly constructed areas of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center including the Spinal Cord Injury Unit and the Polytrauma areas. 
The outside dimensions of the building is approximately 750' X 735'.
A similar system was successfully implemented at the Frank Tejeda Out-Patient Clinic, approximately 4 miles northwest of Audie L. Murphy facility. At Frank Tejeda Out-Patient Clinic, signals are received from Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center system, amplified and distributed throughout the building on a distributed antenna system. Signals from the portable radios are received on the internal antenna system and routed to an amplifier from where they are transmitted back to the prime site. Prior to installation of this system handheld radios at the clinic did not perform reliably. 


. 4.  Scope. 
Contractor shall provide an expandable bi-directional amplifier (BDA) system through a distributed antenna system (DAS) to propagate signals to/from the existing Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center Motorola Smartzone Trunking site in such a manner as to achieve a minimum -80 db signal throughout the First Level of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center and all levels below, including the Pipe Chase, the Polytrauma and Spinal Cord Injury areas. 
The implementation will be in phases to accommodate funding available at the time of contracting. 
The first phase of the project will include the BDA/DAS backbone only. It will include installation of a fiber-driven head-end unit and a portion of the estimated DAS. Future phases will include implementation of the fiber connectivity system and remote BDA units with an expanded DAS network.
Contractor shall be responsible for all design and/or engineering work, labor and materials necessary to complete the project.  And shall provide as-built drawings and signal propagation measurements overlaid on floor plans provided by Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center.
The distributed antenna system (DAS) shall be installed in the interstitial areas of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center when possible. If any portion of the DAS will be installed in public areas of Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center, specific permission to do so must be obtained from Audie L. Murphy VA Medical Center point of contact (POC). 
5. Specific Tasks.

FAR 52.232-34 -- Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer -Other Than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999)

(a) Method of payment.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 

(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).

(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 

(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.

(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).

(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).

(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.

(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.

(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).

(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.

(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

(End of clause)

(End of Clause)






VAAR 852.211-70  SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984)

 (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
  (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.
  (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
  (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
  (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied.

Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
  (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
  (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included.

(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and

(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.


(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from this solicitation and to extend the period of performance to 4:00 PM C.S.T. Wednesday March 27, 2013. Question 1 You identified the (4) four primary components and their associated drawings. Are we to assume that only welded and fabricated components are required and not items associated with the Chamber Assembly i.e. Dwg 120603100. Answer Yes that assumption is correct, only welded and fabricated components are required. Question 2 Drawing No. 120603100 calls out for the following drawings that are not included in the drawing package: 	120603101 	120603102 	120603200 	120603300 	120603500 	120603600 Drawing 120603610, Item 8 calls out for Conflat Flange 10.00 for 8.00 OD Tube Drawing 120603616 calls for 6.00 OD Tube. Answer The referenced drawings were intentionally omitted.  Currently, we are seeking a quote regarding those specific parts which require vacuum integrity. This 6 in diameter tube is a mistake.  It should be 8 in. to accommodate the 8 to 10 in flange.

Can you confirm that this opportunity is unrestricted, full and open?
<p>Yes. This acquisition for the specified architect-engineering services is Unrestricted, Full and Open Competition and will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 36 "Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts, Subpart 36.6 "Architect-Engineer Services". (See paragraph 2 of Synopsis)</p>
<p>2. Please confirm the small business size standard is $4.5 Million. Our understanding was that the small business size standard was increased to $14 Million for small businesses with the NAICS code 541330.</p>
<p>The small business size standard for NAICS 541330 is $14 million.</p>
<p>3. What are the small business/disadvantaged business, etc. goals for this opportunity?</p>
<p>For offerors that are not small business concerns, the Depart of the Treasury has established small business subcontracting goals to assure small businesses receive a fair proportion of Treasury awards. The small business subcontracting goal for this procurement is 52%. The following represents the subcontracting goals for the remaining socio-economic programs: Small Disadvantaged Business: 5%; Women-Owned Small Business: 5%; HUBZone Businesses: 3%; and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business: 3%. While Treasury does not have a specific target for subcontracting with Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, this must be addressed in any subcontracting plan. The Plan must be expressed in both percentages and dollars.</p>
<p>4. Is there a page limit for the Qualifications packet? What about page size and font size?</p>
<p>"RESPONSES MUST INCLUDE: Hard Copy:1 Original inclusive of original signatures as required and 4 Duplicate-original copies of the Standard Form 330, Part I "Qualifications for a Specific Contract" and PART II "Architect-Engineer Qualifications" for any consultants (dated and signed by an official within the past twelve months). Electronic Copy: 1-Compact Disc Read Only Memory, CD-ROM of Original-Hard Copy." (Please follow the response instructions in the Synopsis). Electronic signatures are acceptable.</p>
<p>5. Do all subconsultants also need to be licensed in the geographic areas listed in the synopsis? Or is it just the Prime that needs to be licensed in those geographic areas?</p>
<p>The primary contractor is the responsible party.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.       <br>          <br>     The US Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District is requesting proposals for non-personnel services to provide drilling and piezometer installations at the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  Services include subsurface borings for the installation of 2-inch diameter PVC piezometers with five-foot long screens.     <br>     The Lake Washington Ship Canal project provides a connective waterway between Puget Sound and Lake Washington through Lake Union.  The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (Locks) part of the project consists of a small and large lock, a concrete gravity dam and spillway, saltwater drain, guide walls, and fish ladder.  The fish ladder and locks also provide fish passage past the lock and dam structure.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1. Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
     	Office of Acquisition Operations
       	Acquisition Business Service
           425 I Street, NW
           Washington, DC 20001

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a new contract using other than full and open competition for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) effort with two (2) one (1) year option periods for Canon copier maintenance to be performed on four (4) Government-owned Canon copiers located in the Office of the Executive Secretary (OSVA) at the VA Central Office (VACO) in Washington, DC.  This document supports a brand name justification restricting competition to vendors who are certified by Canon, USA to conduct maintenance on the requisite copiers.  This Brand Name Justification is prepared in accordance with FAR 11.105(a)(1), Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer, the particular brand name, Canon, is essential to the Government's requirements.  Market research indicates that only a Canon certified vendor has the capability to meet the agency's maintenance needs for the pre-existing, Government-owned Canon copiers.  There are no other possible substitutes available under the circumstances further described below.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This acquisition is restricted to companies that are certified by Canon to provide maintenance on four (4) Canon copiers within the OSVA office at 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420.  The companies must be certified by Canon to perform maintenance on the specific model of copier.  For this acquisition, the models requiring maintenance are IRC5185 and IRC4080.  The total estimated cost for this acquisition for the entire period of performance of one (1) six (6) month base period plus one (1) twelve (12) month option period is $48,042.24.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  This is a Brand Name Justification and is authorized under 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements," in application of 6.302(c), "Application for Brand Name Descriptions."  

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Companies certified by Canon to conduct maintenance support on Canon copier models IRC5185 and IRC4080 are the only vendors capable of providing a specialized solution that is compatible with the existing Canon copier systems and with current business needs.  The nature of this acquisition requires that only Canon certified businesses respond to the solicitation as only Canon copier parts and pieces can be utilized in this maintenance requirement.  Due to the pre-existing nature of the Canon copiers, and in order to ensure that the Canon warranties are not voided, there is no other commercial alternative for providing a maintenance solution.  Businesses certified by Canon to conduct maintenance on the requisite copiers have the unique qualifications and specialized capabilities, signified by an official certification issued by Canon, to conduct the required maintenance and access the necessary Canon copier parts.  It is imperative that the copier maintenance provided be from a Canon certified business in order to guarantee that the form, fit, and function of the maintenance parts needed are compatible with the existing, previously installed Canon copier systems.  This acquisition approach simplifies maintenance and ensures continuity of operations.

6.	Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any sources that are not certified by Canon to conduct maintenance and can meet the Government's requirements.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated. Additionally, the ordering activity will make publicly available the justification along with the solicitation in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c).

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed without the current Brand Name restrictions.  Additionally, the Government intends to compete any future OSVA copier requirements utilizing full and open competition, as the regulations and marketplace allows.

8.  Market Research:  The Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO) Acquisition Business Service (ABS) issued a Request for Information (RFI) on January 25, 2013 via FBO to ascertain whether any other sources can meet the Government's requirements.  Responses were received from four (4) sources, and of these sources, three (3) provided no formal documentation that they hold Canon certification to conduct maintenance; however, they did demonstrate capabilities to potentially meet the Government's requirement. 

9.  Other Facts:  This solicitation is being competed as a total small business set-aside under FAR Part 13, utilizing the Brand Name justification which restricts the competition to companies that are certified by Canon U.S.A., Inc. to conduct maintenance on the pertinent Canon copiers.

10.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

Name: Arna Hunter				   	Date: 2/26/2013    

Title: Administrative Officer				Signature: /ES/

11.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on comparison with prices historically paid in the past as well as comparisons with the IGCE and current commercial market pricing.  Additionally, it is important to note that adequate price competition is expected to be achieved despite the Brand Name nature of this requirement as market research revealed that there are multiple companies capable of providing the requisite services under the appropriate certification.

12.  Procuring Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  As this contract action does not exceed $650,000, the certification below required by FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) serves as approval.

Name: Brynn K. McGowan		Date: 3/15/2013

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide&nbsp;an updated Request for Information (RFI) to replace the previously posted RFI.&nbsp; There are no other changes to this announcement.<br /><br />****************************************************<br />Introduction and Purpose:<br />This is not a notice of Solicitation Issuance. This is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.<br />With this RFI, the Department of the Air Force is requesting information from interested parties regarding a potential transaction under which a non-federal private or public entity would operate certain Air Force golf courses. Specifically, the Air Force is requesting information as it pertains to the potential operation of golf courses located at the following locations: Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB) in Santa Barbara County, CA, Peterson AFB in El Paso County, CO, and Patrick AFB in Brevard County, FL. The Air Force plans to use information received in response to this RFI in determining whether to issue a solicitation for the project and, if so, to assist in development of the content for the solicitation. <br />Background Information:<br />The Air Force views public-private or public-public ventures, generally referred to as "community partnerships," as a potential way of capitalizing on the expertise and resources of the private or local government sector to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. <br />The Air Force has several tools available to enter into community partnerships, in addition to standard acquisition procedures. One example is Enhanced Use Leases, under which the Air Force leases under-utilized real property to public or private entities for not less than fair market value, for which the Air Force can receive as cash or in-kind consideration. Another example is Intergovernmental Support Agreements with state and local governmental entities, under which the Air Force can receive, provide or share installation support services to enhance mission effectiveness or promote economic efficiency. <br />Description of Project or Need: <br />Vandenberg AFB is located in Santa Barbara County, CA outside the cities of Lompoc and Santa Maria. The 18-hole golf course, known as Marshallia Ranch, is considered one of the top places to play within the Air Force portfolio of golf courses. The course sits adjacent to the oldest building on the installation, Marshallia Ranch House. Opening in 1958, Marshallia Ranch Golf Course sits outside the fence line of the main base and is open to the general public; without any need for background checks or military sponsorship.

The 18-hole golf course, known as Silver Spruce, opened in 1973 and offers golfers views of the Rocky Mountains. Anyone with identification clearance through the installation gate can play. Peterson does not have a non-DoD civilian waiver like at Vandenberg AFB and Patrick AFB. Members of the general public without military sponsorship can file for a gate pass that is good for one year. These passes generally take one to two weeks to obtain. The course opened the back 9 holes in 1972 and the front nine holes in 1976. They were designed by architect Dick Phelps and a new driving range and teaching facility was added in 2009.<br />Peterson FY12 FY11 FY10 FY09 FY08<br /># Holes 18 18 18 18 18<br />Total Rounds 29,254 29,016 20,344 25,631 35,195 <br />Total Revenue $1,019,820 $1,055,090 $1,108,700 $1,093,600 $1,161,970<br />Net Income After Depreciation $(128,100) $14,632 $16,478 $45,427 $(122,426)</p>

This 18-hole golf course offers spectacular views to its patrons through its location between the Banana River and Atlantic Ocean. The 260 acre parcel, known as Manatee Cove Golf Course, is home to many wildlife animal species. As the Patrick AFB Golf Course is located "inside the fence line", Manatee Cove currently has a waiver for non-DoD affiliated personnel to play on the course, IAW AFIs 34-262 and 34-116 (renewable every two years). All civilians, no matter if they have a sponsor or not, must be cleared by applying for civilian base access. This process can take up to fourteen days to complete but is good for one year. The course opened in 1961 and was designed by architect Robert Trent Jones Sr. A new clubhouse was added in 2007 and new green complexes were added in 2008. Additionally, a new pump station was built in 2010 along with a new irrigation system in 2012.<br />Patrick FY12 FY11 FY10 FY09 FY08<br /># Holes 18 18 18 18 18<br />Total Rounds 56,292 49,376 45,143 45,935 44,613 <br />Total Revenue $1,383,550 $1,346,900 $1,601,920 $1,596,700 $1,405,930<br />Net Income After Depreciation $187,306 $14,017 $(68,263) $(164,109) $(319,141)</p>

<DESC>***The purpose of this amendment is to provide Questions and Answers (Q&A).  <br><br>Question 1: Has a determination been made if there will be both large and small IDIQ awards as well as small business set-aside task orders?<br><br>Answer 1: <br>The current RFI is to help the Government obtain information from large and small business to develop the acquisition strategy. Currently the Government does not have a schedule for IDIQ awards nor set-asides.<br><br>Question 2: <br>Paragraph 1.1 of the Draft PWS states that MC Field Support provides PPSS/PDSS to the users of business sustainment systems. It then goes on to state that these systems include command and control, knowledge management, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), counter remote controlled improvised explosive device, tactical communication, and fire support. <br><br>This statement implies that PM MC will be providing under this Potential Task Order all field support for the entire range of C4ISR systems. Will PM MC Field Support Services be providing field support to the entire C4ISR collection of systems or will it be for those systems which are managed within PM MC?  <br><br>Answer 2: <br>The draft PWS is a request for only PM Mission Command Field Support Services systems as identified in 3.1 in the draft PWS and stated below:<br><br>The contractor shall provide support for a variety of MC tactical and business systems, including but not limited to:<br>1.  Fire Support Command and Control family (Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDS) (Forward Observer System (FOS), Pocket Sized Forward Entry Device (PFED), Centaur, Gun Display Unit- Replacement (GDU-R)<br><br>2.  Tactical Mission Command (TMC) (Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Web, SharePoint<br><br>3.  Strategic Mission Command (Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A), Defense Readiness Reporting System Army (DRRS-A), Common Software (CS), Data Dissemination Service (DDS)<br><br>4.  Sustainment System Mission Command (SSMC) Battle Command and Sustainment Support System (BCS3)<br><br>Question 3:<br>Does this mean that the engineering efforts sited in paragraph 3.6 will be migrated from the SETA support currently performed within the TMD sections of the PM to the RMD sections of PM MC?<br><br>Answer 3:<br>No.  The technical support will be for actions and issue that relate to field service support only and will not impact TMD engineering effort or support. <br><br>Question 4: <br>PWS 1.6 - The Inspection and Acceptance/FOB section seem to be in conflict. The first paragraph and single sentence following it is <br>contradictory. <br><br>Answer 4:<br>The posted draft PWS is still in the development stage.  Information on the PWS is still under review and being edited for correction deletion and additions.  This is not a request for quote only information and sources sought.   <br><br>Question 5: <br>PWS 3.11 numbering is duplicated - it is used for Field Exercises and Demonstrations and for Help Desk Services. Suggest a revised PWS for the Section 3.0 be posted.  <br><br>Answer 5: <br>The posted DRAFT PWS is still in the development stage.  Information on the PWS is still under review and being edited for correction deletion and additions.  This is not a request for quote only information and sources sought.   <br><br>Question 6: <br>PWS 3.2.2 - Is it the Governments intent to procure "dedicated" Regional Manager Support that are 100% dedicated to PM MC requirements; Or is it an option to share resources and utilize other Regional Manager support assets already in place (e.g. SEC FSD/other Regional Manager support Teams)? <br><br>Answer 6: <br>The posted DRAFT PWS identifies only the requirement for personnel to support the various FSS PM MC requirements. This is not a request for quote only information and sources sought.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /><br />Title: Multi-Disciplinary Investigations of Environmental Causes of Cancer<br /><br />The Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodologic research, specialized tasks in large scale studies, full scale support for cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies.<br /><br />A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within HREB importantly focus on sex differences in cancer etiology and address risk factors for some of the most prevalent gender-specific cancers of men (prostate, testis) and women (breast, endometrium, ovarian, cervix).  In addition, efforts are placed on clarifying the etiology of a number of rare cancers (e.g., liver cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, male breast cancer).<br /><br />To achieve its goals, HREB's approach has been to (1) integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers into interdisciplinary molecular epidemiologic investigations to understand a variety of exposures as related to multiple cancers and gain insights into mechanisms that mediate risk factors; (2) to sub-divide tumors into etiologically and prognostically distinct entities; (3) examine natural history of and progression for cancer precursors; (4) address rapidly emerging issues in cancer epidemiology through novel investigations of poorly understood risk factors and under-studied hormonal and reproductive cancers; and (5) assist in training the next generation of hormonal, reproductive, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophical focus of HREB research is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in HREB research. Approximately thirteen studies will likely receive support under the contract.<br /><br />This support services contract is essential for HREB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/HREB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining exposures to identify new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk. Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of epidemiological studies and diverse biological specimens, and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements in order to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) studies.<br /><br />The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the HREB professional staff.<br /><br />This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200800029C held by Westat, Inc.<br /><br />The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of one year and eight  six-month option periods may be awarded beginning on or about September 1, 2013.<br /><br />The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>The Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Hood, TX intends to award a Firm Fixed-Priced sole source, short term bridge contract to Infomedia Group, Inc. D/B/A Carenet, for continued services for the telenurse advice line under the authority of 6.302-1(a)(2),  quote mark Only One Responsible Source quote mark , on or before 1 April 2013.  Services include, but are not limited to, the provision of all personnel, labor, materials, equipment, and services for approximately 150,000 Department of Defense (DoD) eligible beneficiaries in the III Corps and Fort Hood community, and local surrounding areas.  The Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) Nurse Advice Line Service is a vital component of the installations Total Customer Satisfaction Objective.  The Nurse Advice Line will provide clinical assessment and appropriate level of care support services for the TRICARE program.  The period of performance for these continued services shall not exceed six (6) months.  <br>  The purpose of this bridge contract is only for the continuation of services until a DoD Level competitive contract can be awarded.  Due to fiscal uncertainties and an appeal, CRDAMC has been notified that the award of the follow-on contract has been delayed.  Continuation of services is required to prevent an interruption in the Nurse Advice Line to Fort Hood, TX and surrounding area beneficiaries.  The transition of these services from one contractor to another is anticipated to be 60-90 days and an interruption in services would have an immediate negative impact on current health care operations, current health care services and our soldiers, civilians, and beneficiaries.    <br>   The NAICS Code for this requirement is 621399 with a small business size standard of $7.0 Million.   This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date.

Procurement Description <br>  <br> The Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Weapons Development and Integration Directorate (WDI) requests the purchase of maintenance for MasterKey Plus Base, MSC Nastran MD Implicit NL, MSC Nastran MD Explicit NL Package, and software maintenance renewals through IMMIXTECHNOLOGY, INC. in support of the Platform Integration Function. <br>  <br> II. Noncompetitive Justification <br>  <br> MSC is the sole developer of the MSC.Patran , MSC.Nastran , MSC SOL400 Implicit Nonlinear, MSC SOL700 Explicit Nonlinear and MSC.Fatigue  software, and ImmixTechnology, Inc., McLean, Virginia is MSC's only entity legally capable of providing this service as the only GSA service source.  The required software is necessary to allow greater flexibility for conducting spectral analysis, fatigue life estimations, damage estimations, and crack growth rates both analytically and experimentally.	As per the requirements of this software and in order to ensure that the software performs to its maximum capability, the maintenance/upgrade is needed.  Full and open competition is not feasible.  Purchase of the service through ImmixTechnology, Inc. is the only approach that meets this requirement. <br>  <br> This sole source justification meets the requirements of FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> III. Promotion of Future Competition <br>  <br> The WDID is continually evaluating and integrating emerging technologies to provide capability to our warfighters.  As future requirements become known, market surveys will be conducted to ensure maximum competition to the fullest extent possible. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> TOMMY DOBSON, Ph. D.

<AWARDEE>CMC ELECTRONICS INCORPORATED (CAGE: 90073)
<DESC>This synopsis is for the repair order N00383-13-M-058D. The order covers the repair of 2 POWER CONVERTER (NSN: 7RE 6615 012015630 VH, P/N: 100-481440-001) and 1 CENTRAL INDICATOR DISPLAY (NSN: 7RE 1680 012845122 VH, P/N: 100-601346-000). CMC ELECTRONICS INCORPORATED (CAGE: 90073) is the only approved source to repair.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> PRIORITY 3 ACQUISITION MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BELOW THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br>  <br> 1.  Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2.  Description of Action: Urgent procurement of Spinal Fusion Implant System needed for a non-routine surgery.   <br>  <br> 3.  Description of Products/Services:  Spinal Fusion Implant System is used for surgical treatment Laminectomy and Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion.     <br>  <br> 4.  Authority Cited:  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting competition.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency). <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 5.202(a) (2), Exceptions. The unusual and compelling requirement will not be advertised. <br>  <br> -Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106(c)(1), Soliciting competition.  Price and availability will be obtained telephonically. <br>  <br> 5.  Reason for Cited Authority: The above statutory authority is cited because this is a true, urgent request that has been verified by Emerita Torres on 5 March 2013.  The Spinal Fusion Implant System must be received for a non-routine surgery scheduled on 11 March 2013.  If the physician does not have this System during surgery, it could be detrimental to the patient's life as well as the hospital's overall medical mission.  <br>  <br> 6.  Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Signature:  ///ORIGINAL SIGNED 3/5/2013/// <br> Name:        Melissa Oliva				 <br> Title:       Contracting Officer			 <br>                                                                     <br>

		Memorandum


Date:	January 14, 2013
From:	Kristine Hostetler, Contract Specialist, CMOP Tucson, Arizona 
Subj:	Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

I. The following information is provided to request a contract with R/X Automation Solutions (RXAS) for a semi-automatic bottle opening system to support the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program. 
(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition."
The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Acquisition Center is procuring a semi-automatic bottle opening system to support the CMOP program.  
(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
A new contract is requested for a sole source semi-automatic bottle opening system (Bulkmaster) to improve CMOP production output and decrease costs.  The equipment is not on FSS or other VA contracts. This equipment is new and does not replace currently owned equipment. 
 (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 
The proposed action is to provide and install a semi-automatic bottle opening system at the CMOP facility located in Tucson, AZ. The estimated value is $190,000.  
	(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open 	competition. 
Citations:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. 
(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 
RXAS is the original designer and currently the only vendor of a highly specialized commercial off-the-shelf prescription drug bulk-up system designed to discharge and process the contents of fully-closed bottles at a high speed.  The BulkMaster is designed to open a wide range of HDPE bottle sizes and shapes used in the CMOP production process.   The BulkMaster is a proven system that is already in operation and fully tested at other commercial pharmaceutical dispensing facilities (Walgreens, Medline and Wal-Mart) and two other CMOP facilities (Hines and Leavenworth).  
The BulkMaster system is compatible with the CMOP production process protocols and is able to be integrated seamlessly with the CMOP high speed production equipment.  Currently, four pharmacy technicians manually process approximately 150-200 bottles per hour.  Hand dispensing introduces staff challenges including repetitive injuries, dispensing errors, and pill loss or contamination.  The BulkMaster system increases the process up to 900 bottles per hour with only two staff required.  Pharmacy technicians using the BulkMaster only load the bottles onto the feed table.  This reduced staff/machine  interaction virtually eliminates repetitive injuries, dispensing errors and pill loss or contamination. This also allows two pharmacy technicians to be assigned to the packing and labeling stations.  The combined benefit from integrating the BulkMaster into the CMOP production system is a 200% increase of prescription medications produced for the veterans and potentially cutting the time for delivery by a full day.    
(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that competition is limited to RXAS.  A Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract will be issued using FedBizOpps.
 (7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 
As the contracting officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on an evaluation of other than cost or pricing data which includes, but is not limited to, a comparison of offered prices to prior prices, an evaluation of commercial catalogs and published price lists, or a comparison of prices RXAS charges and the discounts they give, if any, to their commercial customers. 
   (8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
A Sources Sought Notice (VA797M-13-I-0046) was issued on 15 November 2012 with two responses received. Only RXAS can provide a COTS semi-automatic bottle opening system readily available to meet the CMOP program requirements. A search on SAM, VetBiz, and GSA eLibrary for NAICS 333993 (Packaging Machinery Manufacturing) was completed and several small businesses were discovered.  It was determined that no other company can provide a solution without a custom development.
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 
Not applicable.  The Statement of Work has been developed and is incorporated into the solicitation VA797M-13-R-0069.
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.
Not applicable.
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.
Not applicable.
(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
R/X Automation Systems and Calvary Automation Systems expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
 (11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
The Government requires a COTS system.  Future acquisitions will be procured on a competitive basis if other contractors can provide a COTS product.

?
CERTIFICATION
I hereby certify that the foregoing Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is complete and current to the best of my knowledge and belief:
