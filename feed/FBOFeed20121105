<DESC>A sole source procurement is being contemplated with Sunshine Aero Industries Inc., 3164 Airport Rd., Crestview, FL 32539. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida desires to purchase services for a 5-day captive carry mission in support of an international research and development program. The USAF needs to acquire data from 5 days of captive carry flights of government-provided experimental Instrumentation/camera systems. The captive carry flight test required under this action is the third in a series of five such flight tests for the Airborne Image Gyro program. SAI has conducted the first two on a Beechcraft B-18 aircraft, and this third test will require a KingAir100 aircraft to achieve higher airspeeds. The U.S. Air Force purchased an internal computer rack from SAI which is FAA-certified for use on both aircrafts. The U.S. Air Force provides the external camera pod for attachment under the belly of the aircraft. SAI has modified the two aircraft with structures to carry external loads, and each of the plane's carriage hardware (though different) has been FAA-approved for the appropriate aircraft. The USAF designed the attachment hardware for the pod to fit the specialized design of SAI's carriage hardware. Due to FAA requirements, no other source is capable of performing these services within the time requirements. However all interested parties may submit statements of capabilities(SOC) which should, if possible, include at least three references from customers who have purchase the above services. These will be considered if received by noon central time 20 Nov 2012.

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

The Government intends to procure Transformer Rectifier Units (TRU) integrated into the Fixed Forward Firing Weapons (FFFW) System and the MH-60S helicopter.  The MH-60S requires a power supply to convert AC power from the aircraft into DC power.
  The incoming power is 115 VAC at 400Hz.  The TRU converts this into clean 28 VDC power to use throughout the aircraft, in particular the FFFW and its subsystems.  The TRU shall be the same as used in the A/A49E-27 20 mm automatic gun helicopter armament subsystem.    

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 336413.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into a Firm Fixed Price, IDIQ (5-year) type contract.  The anticipated IDIQ contract award maximum is estimated to be 3,000,000.00 U.S. Dollars.  The contract will be F.O.B. Destination with Inspection and Acceptance by DCMA.  The anticipated lead time for items is 190 days.
  This anticipated procurement will be solicited on a sole source basis with Eldec Corporation, 16700 13th Ave W., Lynnwood, WA 98037-8503, CAGE: 08748, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is the Government lacks sufficient technical data, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement through any other source.  The TRU model number is 4-055-02 and is determined a modified commercial item.  

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p>The work consists of&nbsp;removal of pinnacle and shelf rock within the Middle Mississippi River navigation channel. A series of rock outcrops totaling approximately 6,700 cubic yards needs to be removed to meet authorized project width and depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement is solicited as an unrestricted competitive procurement. The locations and material type is listed below:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Wittenberg/Grand Tower: River mile 82.0 to 79.0. Bedrock at the upstream point near Wittenberg lies within a fault zone and is probably composed of hard sandstones and limestone. Interpretation of geophysical soundings indicates that high bedrock is in the form of a large mound or pinnacle and is probably limestone. Downstream of Tower Rock at Grand Tower, bedrock is composed of thinly bedded chert and hard, dense limestone. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this downstream location indicates bedrock is in the form of a shelf extending completely across the channel. <br /><br />Gray's Point: River mile 46.0 to 45.0. The bedrock present at this site is a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates a large bedrock promontory and some large pinnacles present on the Illinois side.<br />Thebes Bridge Area: River mile 45 to 42.8. The bedrock present along this site is a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates the presence of numerous pinnacles. <br /><br />Counterfeit Rock: River mile 42.8 to 39.7. Bedrock at this site lies within a fault zone which offsets various limestone and sandstones within a short distance. From approximately river mile 42.8to 42.0, the bedrock is composed of a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates the presence of small, isolated pinnacles. Downstream of this area, bedrock is composed of both a cherty limestone, which typically erodes into pinnacles and hard sandstone which typically forms ledges. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this downstream location indicates the presence of a rock shelf extending beneath the river channel with localized pinnacles upon it. <br /><br />Commerce: River mile 39.7 to 38.0. The bedrock at this site is composed of thinly bedded and poorly consolidated sandstone lenses with unconsolidated sands and clays, hard dense sandstone, and alimonitic pebble conglomerate. Approximately 30 percent of the rock in this area was able to be removed by drag-line in rock excavation performed in 1984. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates large, isolated pinnacles.<br /><br />&nbsp;The estimated cost range of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990. The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation package will be issued on or about November 20, 2012. The Government will not provide paper copies of the solicitation. The solicitation package will be posted on FedBizOpps, which can be accessed at www.fedbizopps.gov./.

<DESC>&nbsp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>The United States Capitol ("Capitol") in Washington, D.C., is a symbol of the American people and their government and the meeting place of the nation's legislature. The Capitol also houses an important collection of American art, and it is an architectural achievement in its own right. It is a working office building as well as a tourist attraction. The Architect of the Capitol ("AOC" or "Government"), an agency of the legislative branch, manages the facilities comprising the Capitol complex. The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center ("CVC" or "Government") is the newest addition to the Capitol complex. The mission of the CVC is to provide a welcoming and educational environment for visitors to learn about the unique characteristics of the House and the Senate and the legislative process, as well as the history and development of the architecture and art of the Capitol. This is accomplished, in part, by the provision of free tours to the visiting public, educational programs, and the provision of spaces for Congressional events. The CVC provides an increased focus on visitor comfort, safety and security resulting in a seamless, positive visitor experience at the Capitol. The CVC welcomes millions of visitors to the Capitol each year.<br /><br />II. Purpose</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services.

These activities involve close technical consultation with the Project Officer in the conduct of data analyses designed to culminate in high quality research reports. The focus of the AEDS contract is secondary data analysis of survey data and collection of secondary survey data for use in scientific reports. The Contractor will be expected to provide a broad range of skilled personnel in areas including the following (epidemiology,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>statistics, sampling, data analysis, systems design, programming, graphic arts, information technology, scientific writing and editing, clerical, secretarial, and administrative).<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Georgia', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><br />a. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the lead agency in the US for research on alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and other health effects of alcohol.&nbsp;NIAAA provides leadership in the national effort to reduce alcohol-related problems by: 1) conducting and supporting research in a wide range of scientific areas including genetics, neuroscience, epidemiology, health risks and benefits of alcohol consumption, prevention, and treatment; 2) coordinating and collaborating with other research institutes and Federal Programs on alcohol-related issues; 3) collaborating with international, national, state, and local institutions, organizations, agencies, and programs engaged in alcohol-related work; and 4) translating and disseminating research findings to health care providers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. </span></p>

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate five Sole Source commercial item procurements for Multiple Amputation Trauma Trainers for Eglin AFB, and Lackland AFB. This procurement will include liquid blood, Needle D Skin Plugs, Cric Skin, Manubrium Skin Plugs and training. This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than November 12th , 2012 noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil
<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).</p>
<p><br />K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. <br />There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures. The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario. Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide.</p>

<DESC>DESC: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.&nbsp; AFRL/RW, the Munitions Directorate, has been developing advanced guidance, navigation and control technologies inspired by research on natural systems. One line of investigation that is particularly promising results from studying the insect compound eye and applying the design principles to multiaperture wide field of view (WFOV) optical systems for autonomy-capable guided munitions. AFRL/RW is looking to transform this type of bio-inspired WFOV seeker technology into one or more prototype concepts in the future. <br />Family of Seekers: RW is looking for a broad family of seeker concepts and not just one seeker that attempts to solve all mission areas. Solutions should consider: Air-to-Air (attack, self defense), Air-to-Ground (high speed direct attack, loitering, mobile and fixed targets) and other non-traditional conventional seeker roles such as navigation aiding, communications, missile warning, guidance integrated fuzing, and use in space missions. <br />Seeker Attributes: Seeker characteristics are yet to be determined. Areas such as wavebands (UV, Visible and IR) including multispectral, passive polarization sensing, instantaneous FOV/resolution and full seeker FOV (Spherical, Rectangular or other, including regions of high angular resolution [Foveation]) are open for consideration, but the overall concept must focus on the seeker's ability to acquire, track and select the aimpoint on the target.<br />Non-traditional Seeker Roles: The traditional seeker roles of target acquisition in a target rich, cluttered and camouflaged environment and end game tracking are essential. Additionally, the new WFOV concept opens the seeker up to new roles. Other potential roles to be considered include midcourse guidance in GPS denied or degraded environments (egomotion determination through use of optic flow, scene recognition or star tracking), end game obstacle avoidance, and aimpoint selection. Other innovative, non-traditional role concepts are also of interest, such as guidance integrated fuzing, and use of a wide field of view seeker as a communication channel sensor.<br />RW is looking for information on defining requirements for weapon seekers in a broad range of applications as described above, utilizing current expertise and understanding of real world mission requirements and merging that experience with transformational bio-inspired WFOV seeker technologies to develop and assess potential weapon concepts with enhanced capability.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for current state-of-the-art seeker technologies, demonstrated innovation in seeker development and improvement in seeker sciences. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government will evaluate the respondent's capabilities based on experience in the following: a) weapon seeker development, b) seeker technology innovation, and c) weapon employment (end-to-end weapon use) to include mission planning. Based upon the responses to this RFI, an Industry Day may be announced at a later date. This RFI is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>On Friday, 16 NOV 2012 the Army's Force Protection Occupant Centric Platform (OCP) Technology Enabled Capabilities Demonstration (TECD) will hold an information briefing to industry from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM Eastern. Location of the information briefing will be the Detroit Arsenal, 6501 E. 11 Mile Rd, Warren MI 48397-5000 in the Auditorium, Building 200. This will be a forum to inform industry of the OCP TECD's FY12 science and technology (S&amp;T) accomplishments with regards to technical knowledge gained, test data and results of demonstrations and evaluations for protecting soldiers in underbody blast, crash and rollover events.
<p><br />For those not familiar with the OCP TECD, it seeks to identify, develop, and integrate technologies that will protect occupants of ground vehicle systems from underbody threats, crashes and rollovers while maintaining or improving the mobility of the vehicle system while reducing the weight for that protection. The OCP TECD accomplishes this by addressing gaps in occupant protections standards; tools and techniques to research blast, crash and rollover mitigation capabilities; ground vehicle interior technologies for protection of occupants; and ground vehicle exterior technologies for mitigation effects of underbody last events. This allows OCP TECD to provide soldiers and ground vehicle platforms with affordable and manufacturable survivability solutions against known and anticipated threats within specified programmatic requirements.</p>
<p>The OCP TECD Information brief will provide industry with current status of the program by briefing the accomplishments and results from the OCP TECD program. The briefing will address results achieved in the many projects that have been integrated into the OCP TECD. The areas briefed are expected to encompass the following 5 main areas; (1) standards, guidelines and procedures for occupant protection, (2) test preparation procedures for underbody blast testing, (3) interior occupant protection technologies and methodologies, (4) vehicle structures and flooring systems, and (5) underbody blast modeling and simulation tools</p>
<p>All attendees must be U.S. Citizens. No exceptions will be made for this event. By 9 Nov 2012, attendees will need to go to the TARDEC EVENTS website at http://tardec.army.mil/events.aspx and click on the event.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-01-449-8335<br />Name:		Laser Pointer, Red Laser, Instructional, Pen-Style, Battery Operated, 5 3/4"<br />Description:	5-3/4"L x 1/2"D, battery operated pen style laser pointer with clip and red laser. Features metal barrel with clip. Wavelength of 650nm, 300 yard effective range (3,000 yard maximum range), low-battery indicator and blink mode (blink mode and solid laser operated by 2 separate buttons); power output &lt;5 mW (class 3a); constant wave output mode; approx. life = 5,000 hours. 2 "AAA" batteries included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-01-392-5300<br />Name:		Laser Pointer, Red Laser, Instructional, Pen-Style, Battery Operated, 5 1/4"<br />Description:	5-1/4"L x 1/2"D, battery operated pen style laser pointer with clip and red laser. Features metal barrel with clip. Wavelength of 650 nm, 300 yard effective range (3,000 yare maximum range). Power output &lt;5 mW (class 3a); constant wave output mode; approx. life = 5,000 hours. Two "AAA" batteries included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-01-574-8720<br />Name:		Laser Pointer, Green Laser, Instructional, Pen-Style, Battery Operated, 6"<br />Description:	6"L x 1/2"D, battery operated pen style laser pointer with clip and green laser. Features metal barrel with clip. Wavelength of 532nm; 333.3 yard effective range (3,000 yard maximum range); power output &lt;5 mW (class 3a), constant wave output mode; approx. life = &gt;5,000 hours. 2 "AAA" batteries included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-01-449-8335<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	EL888020; LP8335</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-01-392-5300<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	QRT MP-1100Q; QRT MP-1650Q; QRT MP1350Q; QRT MP-1200Q;&nbsp;EL888019; 75837</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-01-574-8720<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	EL888017; LP6401; 35246</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 20, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of State intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order with the American Red Cross (ARC) National Headquarters in Washington, DC for office furniture. This is a one-time purchase as DoS is planning to acquire approximately 29,892 sq ft of fully furnished office space from the American Red Cross. The furniture is only a couple of years old and in good usable condition. By purchasing this furniture from the American Red Cross as DoS signs the building lease, the Department is estimating a savings of over $590,000.00 in product as well as tear-down and removal of the exisiting and delivery and installation costs (not including the Government administrative costs of procurring new furniture). The estimated savings are substantial when compared to having to refurnish the entire space and having the American Red Cross remove all of the furniture from the premises which may or may not fit in their new location which will cause an unneeded delay in DoS taking occupancy.<br /><br />This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other than Full and Open Competition (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)) and (FAR 13.501). The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (1). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (A) (B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the angency requirements. There will be substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur if we do not proceed under this authority.<br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, ARC&nbsp;is to sign a lease by the end of January 2013, with the understanding that DoS will take the space "as-is", including the furniture in place as descibed above. The purchase of the furniture cannot be included in the lease because of the separation betweem real property and furnishings. No vendor can provide furniture equal to the existing without having to design, produce and install the product to provide 160 offices/work stations for less than the asking price of $281,000.00. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government. The Government intends to proceed with the sole source as DoS intends to occupy the new space and accept existing furniture already in place. Responses are due 14 Novemeber 2012, 12:00PM Eastern Time. Responses shall be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:MoreauKL@state.gov">MoreauKL@state.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, to award a sole source firm-fixed price services contract to prepare the Final Title Commitment Policy and conduct real estate closing services in support of the purchase of land that will allow for the construction of a new Border Patrol Station in Detroit, Michigan. Contract award will be made to Greco Title Agency, the firm responsible for preparing the initial Title Commitment Policy and subsequent updates for the preferred site which included over one hundred separate parcels. The Title Company was also involved in coordination of the affidavit that will ultimately allow the Government to clear title and purchase the preferred site. The Title Company will be required to provide a team that includes personnel that were involved in producing the original Title Commitment. Resumes and certifications for all personnel will be required to be submitted for the approval of the Contracting Office.<br /><br />It is advantageous to the Government to contract with the firm which prepared the original Title Commitment Policy due to their familiarity with the project. Greco Title Company has already prepared and updated the Title Commitment Policy and has been involved with the process for clearing the various interests in the property. If another firm provided these services there would be substantial duplication of costs and the Government would not expect to recover these costs through competition.<br /><br />Any other responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a capability statement not-to-exceed two pages to LRE-Quotes@usace.army.mil by the response date stated on this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, Ms. Kim McDonald (Kim.McDonald@robins.af.mil), WR-ALC/PKC, Bldg 300 West Wing, Robins AFB GA 31098-1611, phone number (478) 472-1088, facsimile number (478) 926-7984.

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>REQUEST FOR QUOTE<br />F3UUBG2286A0010</p>
<p><br />A. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>C3-RC, Bldg 62, Rock Island, IL has a requirement for Pass and ID Equipment. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<br />This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a "Request for Quote" and will use "ALL or NONE" for the purposes of award and will be awarded to the contractor who is able to supply a product that meets the specifications set forth in this solicitation at the lowest price, and is able to meet a delivery schedule of 35 days after receipt of order (ARO). Payment will be made once all items are delivered, received and accepted.</p>
<p>A Firm Fixed Priced award will be made in accordance with the following Schedule of Supplies:</p>
<p>***All items are being requested by Brand Name or equal***</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION/QTY:<br />LINE ITEM#<br />DESCRIPTION<br />QTY UNIT UNIT PRICE EXT PRICE<br />0001 Fargo HDP5000 Dual Sided Printer with Dual Sided (Fargo Mfg part # 89008) 2 ea <br />0002 HDP5000 Dual Sided Color Ribbon (Diebold Mfg Part # 00106862000L) 70 ea <br />0003 HDP 5000 Holographic film orbit (Diebold Mfg Part # 00106862000N) 70 ea <br />0004 Signature GEM LCD 1X5 USB (Topaz Mfg Part # T-L462-HSB-R) 4 ea <br />0005 HDP 5000 Lamination Overlaminate Clear 250CT (Fargo Mfg part # 81789) 100 ea <br />0006 HD Image Cam Pro w/ Tripod (HDICP Mfg part # HD-CAM) 4 ea <br />0007 Asuried Express ID Badge Design 7 (Fargo Mfg part # 00149447000) 4 ea <br />0008 Direct Shipping Cost 1 Lot <br />TOTAL</p>
<p><br />2. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: <br />a. Authority Cited: FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii): Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>b. Rationale for Limiting Sources: The US Forces, USAF 455 ESFS is responsible for creating badges for access to secure areas on their installation. This is an important mission and the equipment they us must all work together an must be proven to work in the deployed environment. It is instrumental that these items work together as the old system is tearing down and if these items are not procured in a quick manner this will harm the security of the installation that 455 ESFS is at.</p>
<p>c. Market Research: 455 ESFS technical experts performed market research to determine which brand can fully meet the security and compatibility requirements of the network. Market Research is an on going process with each iteration of SEL, the most recent research being 7 July 12 as documented by USFOR-A J6 Maj Richard Williams, Knowledge Management Officer to JCC-A via email dated 15 July 2012 and provided Memorandum for SEL Market Research dated 14 July 2012.</p>
<p>d. Action to Increase Competiton: Members of the 455 ESFS research team are checking with other sources to insure that the best and most useful equipment is being purchased for the process of creating line badges for the flight line and other secure locations on the installation.</p>
<p>e. Other Facts: The current equipment that is being used is days maybe hours away from shutting down. When this equipment breaks the 455 ESFS will not have any measures of issuing line badges to new individuals entering the installation. This could severely slow down or bring to a stop the mission at the installation.</p>
<p>f. Contracting Officer Certification: The content of this limited source justification are accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officers knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. SHIPPING: Direct shipment should be made to the following address:</p>
<p>455 ESFS<br />Attn: SSgt Ryan Cook<br />Bagram AB, Afghanistan<br />DoDAAC: FB5814<br /><br />4. QUOTES ARE DUE Tuesday 06 November 2012, 12pm CST. This procurement will be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>

<p>c. Provide Tax ID, Cage Code, DUNS, and status as a Small Business.</p>

<p>e. "No Bid" responses are accepted.</p>
<p>f. Contractor is liable for the ACCURACY of submitted quote(s) and for any incurred costs if quote(s) was submitted erroneously.</p>

<p>This procurement is for Brand-Name purchase of 16 Tilt Touch 27" Bare Bones Kit (BBK) manufactured by Ringtail Design for Commander's Tactical Vision (CTV), in support of The Command Post Systems and Integration (PdM CPSI). The BBK consisting of a transit case and a purpose-built display frame with a 27inch projected capacitance touch screen display. This is a Rapid Fielded Initiative (RFI) that will be fielded to Capability Set 14 ARFORGEN units. The CTV's common operating picture (COP) conveys the tactical situation more effectively than conventional maps and contributes to improved leader situational awareness during planning, mission execution, and after action reviews. The CTV system fuses operational and intelligence information by combining TIGR, DCGS-A and JCR data feeds into single common operating picture (COP) projected onto the capacitance touch screen display. The CTV system will provide immediate value to units deployed in theater. Delivery must be no later than November 24, 2012 in order to meet the Army requirements. No other brands will be accepted IAW (FAR) 3.302-1(c)(1). Please see the attached Documents further information.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. <br />(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract. <br />(p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items. <br />(q) Other compliances.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after THE LAST DAY OF THE EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. <br />OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) <br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>2852.223-70 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br />Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)<br />(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.<br />(e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues.

The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.<br />(i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.<br />(j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The plant is equipped with two cement production lines with a total production capacity of 6,200 tons clinker per day. PCL's production costs are rising, particularly in terms of fuel and power. As a result, PCL is intent on maximizing production capacity utilization, maintaining quality, and reducing its cost of production.<br /><br />The selected Contractor will conduct a feasibility study to determine the viability of incorporating the above-referenced biomass-fired power plant, WHR unit, and energy efficiency upgrades in order to assist the Grantee with its energy efficiency goals. The Grantee is planning to implement the biomass-fired power plant to meet the cement plant's internal demand, with any surplus energy being sold to the National Transmission &amp; Despatch Company (NTDC). The preferred fuel is agricultural waste residues such as rice husks and wheat straw. The feasibility study will also analyze the installation of a WHR unit to further reduce the cost of production by capturing the waste heat from the pre-heater and the grate cooler area of its larger kiln. In addition, the Grantee plans to replace old equipment that has reached its useful life or become inefficient with energy efficient equipment. These systems may include compressors, grinding mills, cement mills, pumps, dust collection motors, and filter fans. The Contractor will also conduct an energy audit as part of this activity to determine replacement costs and the availability of energy efficient motors.<br /><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $769,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).<br /><br />A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a> <br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.<br /><br />Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.<br /><br />Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 pm on December 21, 2012</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Applied Best Practices &amp; Coordination (ABC) team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation. The ABC team currently is comprised of two units: The Monitoring, Evaluation, and Training Unit provides guidance and support on monitoring and evaluation and advises on OTI's strategic management processes throughout the life of the program cycle. It also builds the knowledge, skills, and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve both country program performance as well as their own professional development. The Information Design Lab promotes innovation, knowledge sharing, and analysis to strengthen country programs through the application of technology and new approaches. These units coordinate closely with each other as well as with teams and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>The Program Performance Management Specialist/Sr. Program Performance Management Specialist positions utilize the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of best practices, including dynamic monitoring, evaluation, and learning in fast-paced, short-term political transition and stabilization programs in complex environments.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Program Performance Management Specialist/Sr. Program Performance Management Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information, training, and support they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be providing expertise and support for action learning, knowledge sharing, monitoring, and evaluation of OTI's field programs.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To provide direct support in political transition program implementation under OTI's Program, Learning and Innovation division.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Beirut, Lebanon as the senior OTI representative in the country.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Lebanon country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>OTI initiated the Lebanon Civic Support Initiative (LCSI) in January 2010 to support U.S. foreign policy objectives aimed at promoting peace and stability in Lebanon. The program focuses on youth, who are often involved in conflict but also offer the best potential as proponents of peace and agents of change. Through small grants and short-term technical assistance, OTI works with a wide range of civil society partners to foster leadership and advocacy skills among youth, provide alternatives to political extremism, and create independent space for constructive civic activism.  LCSI has recently expanded programming in northern Lebanon, increasing the number of vocational trainings and community projects and events, and working in two areas that are seeing increasing tensions as a result of the spillover effects from the Syrian unrest.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire one Country Representative to work for OTI in Lebanon.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAID's Automated Directives System);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader Middle East (ME), or his/her designee, as well as to the Lebanon Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>While in Lebanon, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout host country, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>2852.223-70 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br />Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)<br />(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG).

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor.

The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>POSITION DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Background</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.&nbsp; OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.&nbsp; The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.&nbsp; It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.&nbsp; The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA&rsquo;s Washington and field offices.&nbsp; The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.&nbsp; OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. OPS performs these functions through several teams, namely, the Operations Support Team, the Overseas Administration Team, the Field Support Team and the Military Liaison Team (MLT).&nbsp; The MLT provides technical assistance and guidance, military liaison and consequence management of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive (CBRNE) events.&nbsp; It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA&rsquo;s capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.&nbsp; The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of MLT and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Introduction</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Program areas of common interest between USAID and the Department of Defense (DoD) include, but are not limited to, humanitarian assistance (disaster response), counter-terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, resiliency, and transformational development.&nbsp; To ensure cohesion among policy goals and operational execution, USAID assigns Senior Development Advisors (SDAs) and OFDA Humanitarian Assistance Advisors/Military (HAA/Ms) to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Pentagon. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The USAID SDA serves as the principal USAID officer to the relevant Combatant Command (COCOM) and to the Pentagon, supporting the full spectrum of policies and activities across USAID&rsquo;s regional and functional bureaus and enabling and empowering the USAID perspective and operational priorities within DoD.&nbsp; The OFDA HAA/M has the lead on coordinating disaster response activities for USAID within the COCOM area of responsibility and to the Pentagon and reports directly to the OFDA Director. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In all areas of activity, the SDA and HAA/M closely collaborate on their messaging to and activities with the GCCs, including sharing information and back-filling one another as necessary.&nbsp; It is also a joint responsibility of the SDA and the HAA/M to keep one another informed of the other&rsquo;s activities.&nbsp; The OFDA and USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) Directors, through OFDA&rsquo;s Military Liaison Team Leader and the CMC Plans Division Chief, prioritize and monitor close collaboration and coordination between their respective offices.&nbsp; At all points, policy and operational guidance is coordinated with broader technical guidance from the relevant USAID bureau, office, and/or team.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the MLU.&nbsp; These activities include military liaison and coordination, deliberate planning, DART deployment, RMT participation and CBRNE disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.&nbsp; The HAA/M will be located within the OPS&rsquo;s MLU and functions as the Division&rsquo;s principal point of contact with the DoD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>OBJECTIVE</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>HAA/Ms provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.&nbsp; The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. &nbsp;Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. &nbsp;The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.&nbsp; When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. &nbsp;The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. &nbsp;The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. &nbsp;In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. &nbsp;In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.&nbsp; In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.&nbsp; The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. &nbsp;The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. &nbsp;When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. &nbsp;As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. &nbsp;If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. &nbsp;If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</span></p>

<DESC>Hill AFB anticipates the formation of a contract with one basic year and four option years for industrial water treatment for the steam boiler systems at Hill AFB. This requirement includes but is not limited to supplies, equipment, tools, personnel, supervision and technical support to perform industrial water treatment for all steam boiler systems.
<p>This contract is anticipated to be a competitive 100% small business set-aside per the SBA and is expected to be solicited at the beginning of December 2012. This will require pricing and a technical volume (including samples of the chemicals to be submitted separately), to be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA). The RFP will also include&nbsp;a generalized PWS (Performance Work Statement) for review by all interested contractors.</p>
<p>Contractors shall submit a letter verifying all components and weight percentages of the products they will provide. Samples are also required from each of the treatment products prior to award. <br /><br />A pre-bid site visit will be coordinated to allow contractors to take samples providing their own vials. No date or time is currently available for this site visit.</p>
<p>All text above is subject to change once the requirement is firm. This is only a brief overview of the requirement and how it will be competed. Please direct any questions or concerns to A1C Lei Yang.</p>

The location and facility for this conference is Building E3330, Room 134, located on Ricketts Point Road, Edgewood, MD.&nbsp; For a map and directions to this facility, please go to <a href="https://www.ecbc.army.mil/about/mapdir.html">https://www.ecbc.army.mil/about/mapdir.html</a></p>
<p>Following the Pre-Solicitation Conference, an opportunity will be afforded to attendees for 15 minute one-on-one discussions with the CIDAS Product Manager. The discussions will be held on 8 November from 1400-1700 at the same general location as the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Interested companies may register for one-on-one discussions at the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Due to the limited amount of time available, one-on-one discussion time slots will be given to interested companies in the order in which they are received until no more slots are available, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Interested companies must pre-register no later than 1530 hours EST&nbsp;6 November 2012 as follows:<br />Request for attendance must be sent via e-mail to Mrs. Kelly Conerly at kelly.y.conerly@navy.mil and Ms. Amanda Yocum at amanda.l.yocum@us.army.mil. Due to conference facility size, attendance is limited. Your request must include the company name, contact person, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and the names of the representatives planning to attend. Attendance is not mandatory and will not affect your eligibility to submit an RFP offer.</p>

<p>All attendees from outside the United States must submit the International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation as a requirement to participate in the Pre-Solicitation Conference and one-on-one discussions. The International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation must be e-mailed to Ms. Conerly and Ms. Yocum at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1530 hours EST&nbsp;6 November 2012.</p>
<p>Detailed information regarding the Pre-Solicitation Conference, including agenda, directions, conference facility and accommodations will be posted when the exact location is announced. It is incumbent upon interested parties to monitor this posting for updated information.</p>
<p>Draft RFP: <br />The draft RFP for the CIDAS program is posted in the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov for solicitation W911QY-13-R-0001.</p>
<p>Send questions and comments regarding the draft RFP to Ms. Jean Greenwood at jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil with a courtesy copy to Mr. Peter Wallace at peter.j.wallace6.civ@mail.mil no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012. Questions received regarding the draft RFP will be discussed at a planned Q&amp;A session during the Pre-Solicitation Conference.</p>
<p>Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS):<br />The goal of CIDAS is to provide the Warfighter a capability that not only detects trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations. This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated. This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating "hot spots" from "clean spots" on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful. Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, DED personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicant.</p>
<p>Refer to the Draft RFP for additional information and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties for participating in the pre-solicitation conference or responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT WALKING BOX: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has completed the contract documents (plans and specifications) and will be soliciting construction proposals for the adaptive reuse/redevelopment of an historic resource known as Walking Box Ranch, as well as, the new construction of a small research and learning campus on site.
The ranch is located west of Searchlight, Nevada, just south of Highway 164.  The project involves the sensitive adaptation of the resource to accommodate public visitation while maintaining the historic integrity of the site and structures.   Another separate, yet integral, element of this undertaking is the development of a field research facility to be operated by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) on a portion of the site outside of the designated historic zone.  Interpretive exhibits will be concentrated in areas open to the visiting public.  Utilities and infrastructure will need to be developed.  The development involves 40 acres in the northwest quadrant of a larger 120-acre, protected parcel.  Sensitive treatment of the developed area and methods to control impact upon the adjacent protect areas is part of this undertaking.
The project consists of, but is not limited to, the stabilization, rehabilitation, and preservation of the following (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Installation of a rock garden to its historic context; 2. Selective demolition and the historic preservation of a 5000 sf ranch house 3. The rehabilitation of a 1500 sf existing bunkhouse and the addition of approx. 600 sf to create a new 2100 sf administration building; 4. The preservation of a 2100 sf barn; 5. The stabilization of a 120 sf ice house.
The project also consists of, but is not limited to, the new construction of (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Extensive site improvement work (grading, vehicular and pedestrian hardscape, utilities and infrastructure, fencing, tortoise habitat fencing, landscape, etc.) of the 40 acre site; 2. A 4300 sf research, classroom, lab facility; 3. A 7700 sf bunkhouse with kitchen facility; 4. A 300 sf campground pavilion; 5. A 1200 sf caretaker residence and garage structure; 6. A 900 sf maintenance facility; 7. A 120 sf blacksmith shop.
This is an educational facility dealing with environmental themes.  It is therefore essential that this undertaking be constructed using sustainable practices.  The project must be registered for certification under a nationally recognized green rating system.  Criteria for evaluating the success of having achieved a sustainable development will be guidance from a rating system such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, or equal.
The construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in support of the Office of the Executive Director for Information Technology (EXIT) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could implement a property management and sample tracking system for multiple Commission needs. The primary goals of the Commission in this effort is to understand:<br />&bull; What market software is available for tracking the acquisition, receiving, tagging, and controlling of assets (whether property or samples)<br />&bull; What are the available approaches to inventory management across multiple locations with the least amount of human involvement, through technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID)<br />&bull; How to best manage the custodianship, borrows, transfers, and excess of assets<br />&bull; How a property management tool can be leveraged to forecast capital replacement costs, either through stand-along functionality, or in conjunction with a budget system</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, CPSC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Commission currently has two systems for tracking assets: Property Management and Sample Tracking. CPSC is interested in technologies that could replace or enhance both systems.</p>
<p>The Property Management System tracks CPSC property. The application provides asset control through bar code labels and readers, property documents, movement tracking, asset depreciation, record archiving, and reporting. Managed assets are located at CPSC headquarters, laboratory, warehouse, library, and regional offices.</p>
<p>The Sample Tracking System tracks a large volume of product samples either purchased or provided as part of an investigation. The samples are used for safety testing each year, and must not have their chain of custody broken. Therefore, the Commission Sample Custodian and other agency staff use this application to ensure sample handling continuity and integrity, and to record the final disposition of a sample. Every sample movement is recorded, and may be cited in court actions. There are a number of reports and search options available for managing samples.</p>
<p>All Commission staff and contractors, about 450 individuals in total, use the Property Management Application. Concurrently, there are no more than 5 users leveraging the system. The Sample Tracking Application is used by a smaller number of individuals, estimated at about 50, and no more than 5 concurrent users.</p>
<p>The applications currently operate on CPSC's network, with standard federal agency authority to operate, in an unclassified, business environment.</p>
<p>CPSC leverages .net applications in its environment, and is particularly interested in cloud-based or software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. The Commission is also interested in understanding what Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products could satisfy Commission needs.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>CPSC is requesting the following information through this RFI:</p>
<p>1. Explain the types of asset tracking systems (property and/or sample tracking) available and the pros/cons of each. <br />2. Explain how asset-tracking systems can enhance knowledge of capital assets and their respective values, and how they can establish a standard process for investment decision-making.<br />3. Explain abilities to automate asset entry into the asset tracking system. For example, can a system associate an asset and enter its data based on the scanning of a UPC, and associate it to a serial number.<br />4. Describe the ability of asset tracking systems to break out assets according to functional roles of government and enterprise funds (ex. public safety, administrative, etc.).<br />5. Explain how the asset tracking systems available could meet or exceed the functionality described for the Property Management System and Sample Tracking System in section 2.<br />6. Are there asset-tracking systems that do not require a connection to CPSC's network (ex. Cloud solutions), yet will provide the desired results? If so, please explain. <br />7. Explain the typical set up and operational results of a workflow (queue) for managing an asset. <br />8. Explain the availability of active/passive systems for managing assets based on a custodian's involvement.<br />9. Explain native or add-on solutions that provide RFID or other physical location tracking capabilities for the asset management system. Include in the explanation how the system tracks physical assets, and what the accuracy is of such tracking capabilities (i.e. within 3 feet, etc.)<br />10. Explain the ability for asset management systems to manage assets in alignment with a chain of custody (i.e. an individual is always in change of an asset, from a legal definition perspective).<br />11. Highlight any problems/issues experienced with using an asset management system.<br />12. Show examples of the data reports generated by an asset management system. Describe how custodians can, on the fly, modify data report parameters without the need for developer involvement.<br />13. Show examples of bulk data processes (example: purge, update, check in, etc.).<br />14. Describe the ability to tailor reports to property custodians based on unique property tracking needs, such as a type of property, or a location.<br />15. What is a typical length of time for fully implementing an asset management system? <br />16. Describe the ability of asset management systems to interface via a standard data exchange (ex. web services), with other systems (ex. budget application). <br />17. Explain what is a typical length of time for fully implementing an asset management system.<br />18. Describe the ability of asset management systems to interface via a standard data exchange (e.g. web services, APIs), with other systems (ex. budget application). <br />19. Describe the ability of an asset management system to ingest previously tagged and scanned asset data from a structured (i.e. Oracle) database.</p>

RFI 0001 Sources SoughtVA24813R0005

On a 3rd party review for an A/E project, a Firm has asked 
   1) If 3rd party needs to be certified in every trade, such as mechanical, landscaping, etc Yes, 3rd party A/E firm not individual.  Each discipline involved in project including life safety.
  2) Can 3rd party be just an A/E consultant  YES or must 3rd party be CITP designated?  NO, I don't think a CITP certification exist. What it is referring to is a licensed/registered fire protection/Life safety engineer.  This 3rd party would review the documents in respect to life safety, NFPA, egress and code compliance.  The 3rd party reviewer shall stamp and seal drawings from the state of Florida which certifies compliance and approval.
   3) If CITP designation is required, where is a good place to look for one?  No such designation. 


Statement from the SOW:
The contractor will hire a Certified Independent Third-Party Safety Professional (CITP) for the review of the design documents for compliance with national and local codes, standards, federal and state regulations.  The CITP review will be documented by stamped/ sealed drawings by a registered professional engineer from the state of Florida.

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">The General Services Administration (GSA), working with the administrative offices of the U.S.D.A. Forest Service, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a negotiated Construction Management (CM) professional services contract for the Sidney Yates Consolidation Project in accordance with GSA's quality standards and requirements. The Sidney Yates Building (DC0501ZZ) is located at the corner of 14th and Independence Ave SW.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">The scope of the contract includes design phase management services, procurement phase services, contract administration services and construction phase services including scheduling, inspections, closeout services, claims services (if needed), and other miscellaneous services. This project involves completion of design documents and implements improvements for the 5 story building with basement pursuant to the approved (by Forest Service) concept plans and program of requirements. The Design Build Contractor will complete a set of architectural, mechanical, electrical, HVAC and sprinkler modification construction documents for the project.

The contractor shall execute the removal and legal disposal of furniture and carpeting (in accordance with the GSA property disposition requirements); perform indicated demolition and disposal; and perform minor alterations pursuant to the construction document. The coordination with the Forest Service contracted forces and procurements (i.e. IT, Painting, Furniture and Furnishing) is an additional scope of services that may be required as an option to the contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">The estimated construction cost range for this project is $9 million to $12 million. The construction completion is expected to occur in the last quarter of calendar year 2013.&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>The principle purpose of this contract is to provide support for the NASA Ames Research Simulation Laboratory Facilities (SimLabs). The SimLabs are unique national research and development facilities dedicated to providing researchers with high-fidelity environments in which to conduct simulated flight research and to advance the state-of-the-art of simulation technology. Researchers use the SimLabs facilities to investigate a variety of topics ranging from the design of new aircraft guidance and control systems to the human factors implications of new or existing flight deck displays, airspace operations, air traffic control and automation. In-house projects and experiments are conducted to develop new simulator systems and subsystems, improve simulation systems, develop advanced engineering techniques to improve the fidelity and validity of simulation programs, and incorporate the latest technology into simulation systems. The Simulation Laboratory Facilities are primarily comprised of the Crew-Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF), the Vertical Motion Simulation Complex (VMSC) and FutureFlight Central (FFC).
