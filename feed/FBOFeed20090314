<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract or purchase order pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".
<p>The Clinical Center's Medical Record Department (MRD) is responsible for providing transcription services for a variety of specialized medical reports related to patients' inpatient hospital admissions, day hospital visits, outpatient clinic visits, ambulatory surgery and other complex diagnostic medical studies. Such reports are categorized into four groups including medical reports, diagnostic reports, pathologic reports and letters to outside physicians.<br />The NIH, CC, MRD is seeking a back end speech recognition solution to support its existing dictation and transcription infrastructure. The software must seamlessly integrate within the MRD's existing health information management application infrastructure which is currently supported by 3M's health information transcription platform products including Provider ID<sup>TM</sup>, ChartScript.net<sup>TM</sup>, and ESA<sup>TM</sup>. The desired back end speech recognition solution must be capable of collecting voice files from the NIH dictation system, routing them through a deferred speech recognition processor, and returning a ready-to-edit document in ChartScript<sup>TM</sup> for a medical editor to review prior to presenting the final document to the dictating clinician for review. The back end speech recognition software must be capable of operating and supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. <br />The speech recognition software must be capable of analyzing and utilizing edits made to documents by a medical editor to continually enhance and improve the accuracy of the speech recognition processing software in subsequent dictations completed by each individual clinician. The system must process dictated voice files and present the converted document immediately via a real-time interface processing service. Additionally, the system must be capable of handling provisions for the MRD to apply settings at an individual dictating clinician level to enable reports to be processed via a direct transcription model, therefore, bypassing the speech recognition software if ncessary. The application must be capable of collecting dictated voice files from individual clinicians in order to build the clinicians' voice files. In addition, the system must utilize a continuous learning method and be able to adapt to specific dictating clinicians' dictation habits while also utilizing acoustic learning methods in an effort to maximize the usability rate of recognized text presented in the MRD's ChartScript.net application. The system must be capable of handling approximately 4 million lines of text per year.<br />Additionally, the NIH, CC maintains strict controls over its information technology architecture and as such requires that all connections and data communications occur via a secure connection. Payment for services will be accomplished via a unit cost per line of dictation that passes through the speech recognition service. <br />In responding to this sources sought market survey and to demonstrate capability of providing the back end speech recognition software as described above, vendors must minimally provide information related to the following: 1) specific type of software system utilized/provided/supported; 2) specific transcription platforms and/or speech recognition software supported and utilized by the company; 3) description of related experience in the health information management field particularly implementing and supporting a back end speech recognition system; and 4) overview of information technology security architecture incorporated in the company's current structure. <br />The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information.</p>
<p>Responses should be submitted by no later than March 30, 2009 to Ann Argaman, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, Clinical Center, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 106, Bethesda, Maryland . If there are any questions, they may be e-mailed to aargaman@cc.nih.gov.</p>

The  agency/organization must be designed to assist participants in  achieving housing stability, establishing or recovering key independent living skills, and engaging or re-engaging in supportive services at a level that is usually significantly impeded by continuing homelessness.  3.	The community based program should be supported by a program coordinator/liaison Case Manager who will commit specific amount of his or her time to the program and assist in providing case management to the veterans that reside at the facility. The primary responsibilities for this position include liaison to the VAMC Case Manager and Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) staff that will refer for placement and assistance.4.	The Case Manager at the facility must complete an initial transition plan which will be drafted within 30 days of arrival and a more extensive review will be completed at or before the 90-day mark so that the VA team, the veteran, and the Community Based Program Coordinator can solidify an after-care or placement plan and initiate all relevant subsidy applications.  5.	The Community Based Program Coordinator will collaborate with the VA staff in assuring that all necessary supporting documents are secured and applications completed based on the recommendations of the 90-day review. The VA anticipates that most of the veterans will be recommended for participation in, and be given priority consideration for, the VASH housing voucher program.  However, it is likely that a small minority of participants will need a different, more intensive support such as residential treatment, domiciliary program or a VA sponsored "Per Diem" program. The Community Based Program Coordinator will work with the VA Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) staff to coordinate the aftercare placement once the vet completes the program.6.	The target populations who will reside at the agency are individuals experiencing multiple, interacting barriers to housing stabilization in addition to serious and persistent mental illness, including co-occurring substance use disorders and medical co-morbidities.  7.	The Community Based Program will identify a Project Manager who will be responsible for all gate-keeping and liaison functions including eligibility screening, coordination of care, monitoring and trouble-shooting, and transition/discharge planning.8.	The veterans participating in the program will NOT be charged.  Monthly payments will be made to the Community Based Program as outlined in the contact. The VA will work with participants with earned income or benefits in place to establish a savings plan to help them with initial costs associated with an eventual after-placement.  A primary goal is to assist participants in accessing permanent affordable housing and to help them to begin to develop budgeting skills. 9.	To assure that the transitional program is responsive to the unique needs of Veterans living with Serious Mental Illness (SMI), the VA requests that the Community Based Program establishes a Veterans Consumer Advisory Board.  The board should meet at least quarterly to assist in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the program, including the developing collaboration with the Washington DC VAMC.10.	The Community Based Program should provide on-site staff that will use routine daily activities to create opportunities for acquisition and reinforcement of rehabilitation skills in a wide range of areas, depending on the assessed need.  Skill areas include, but are not limited to:	cooking, nutrition, menu-planning, kitchen safety and sanitation	use of public transportation and orientation to community resources	money management, budgeting, shopping	cleaning, basic household maintenance	personal grooming, hygiene and self-care	psychiatric medication and symptom self-management, including anger management	medical/behavioral health11.	The VA and Community Based Program will need to collaborate and develop a Program Evaluation Tool such as the standard HUD Supportive Housing Program Performance Markers for Transitional Housing Programs. There should be special attention directed towards surrounding engagement and retention (75% will complete at least 3 months in program), rates of successful completion/planned transitions to permanent housing (75%), reasons for discharge and destination/type of housing discharged to, and linkages to/follow-up with medical and psychiatric services (90%).  Occupancy rates will also be monitored continuously.12.	The Program Coordinator/liaison case manager who will serve as the primary contact for VA staff.  The Community Based Program will designate a Clinical Housing Coordinator to oversee the operation of and supportive services in the group home.  This is accomplished in part through weekly site visits fro the Washington DC VAMC staff.13.	.  The Community Based Program will provide multiple documentation to include the following:	Agency Overview and Statement of Qualifications	Certificate of Occupancy for the facility	Copy, current MH-CRF license issued by the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health 	Resumes and position descriptions for key personnel 	Line item budget, justification for price proposal 	Management Plan for ensuring compliance with monthly reporting requirements	Performance Improvement Monitoring and Quality Assurance	Policy on all written authorizations for the disclosure of consumer information 	Policy on the process for client grievances and complaintsAll interested parties are to request full RFP.
