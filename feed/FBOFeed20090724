<p>SOLICITATION: Project ZHTV060027. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 140 days.<br />NAICS CODE: 238210. Size Standard $14M. Install Duplicate Electrical feed to Museum of the Air Force, Area B. Install cable, duct, and padmount switches to create new feed to existing loop circuits serving Museum of the Air Force and The Prairies. Load growth at these sites will cause the existing 250 kcmil cable to be insufficient to serve both loads if one side of the loop fails.

The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.<br />Special Requirement/Considerations: Work will need to be coordinated with the Exterior Electric Shop to allow them to switch electrical loads to accommodate the work with minimal customer electrical outages. Work on switches where power outages are required will need to be scheduled to minimize disruption. <br />Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000. In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award.

<CONTACT>John Sherman, e-mail john_sherman@blm.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to award on a sole source basis to following requirement to IHS, Inc. 321 Inverness Dr SEnglewood, CO 80112-5895 (303) 790-0600. IHS, Inc. is the only known provider of this product.
BLM provides opportunities for commercial development of domestic energy resources on public and Indian lands through the leasing and production of oil and gas.  Currently, the BLM manages and regulates over 24,000 Federal and 7,000 Indian oil and gas leases mostly throughout the West, but in other energy producing States as well.
In determining the volume and value of oil and gas deposits that are contained on Federal and Indian lands, BLM geologists, engineers, and technical support staff conduct reservoir analyses of potential producing reservoirs.  These analyses include conducting paying well determinations to determine whether there are economic resources to authorize leases, approve unitiziation and communitization agreements, conduct drainage and Indian diligence reviews, approve wells spacing units, and determine fair market value of parcels offered at Indian oil and gas lease sales
In order to keep pace with the level of drilling and development activities resulting from recent increases in both the price of oil and gas and the demand for energy resources, the use automated software will greatly enhance the BLMs ability to conduct reservoir analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This software must provide BLM geoscientists and engineers with extensive sets of tools to easily and rapidly resolve key characteristics of a reservoir or prospects by interactively defining geometry, extracting reservoir properties from logs, and making volumetric estimates from surface models. 
In order to meet the demand for and access to Federal and Indian oil and gas reservoir, BLM must have unlimited access to publically-available raster logs.
Raster logs should be indexed to a vendors well header data and made available as an annual subscription for Texas Railroad Districts1-4 (a minimum of approximately 295,000 raster logs currently available to date); North Louisiana (a minimum of approximately 87,000 raster logs currently available to date), South Louisiana (a minimum of approximately 75,000 raster logs currently available to date) and the Rocky Mountains States of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming ( a total minimum of approximately 453,000 raster logs currently available to date) making annual log budgeting easy. Raster logs should also be forthcoming for New Mexico, South Dakota and Utah.  Logs are updated daily Exploration and exploitation geologists may instantly access logs on a whenever basis to support prospect studies or plans for drilling.
Log availability is easy to see via links in Well CDs and through an online system, so that the user may quickly see what logs are available for the user, as he goes.  Query results will be populated into an online log net system automatically so that the user may quickly download the logs he needs.
Raster Logs must be enhanced through the process of depth registration. This process involves scaling the vertical axis of the log while maintaining the familiar appearance of a paper log. Every row of pixels, therefore, is calibrated with depth. This allows the user to manipulate well logs onscreen with speed and flexibility, and use them in PC-based analysis in ways similar to digital log equivalents, but at a fraction of the cost.
Compatibility: Raster logs must be easy to import into geoscience applications such as PETRA, GeoGraphix and KINGDOM (available in KINGDOM version 8.1). Logs may also be printed using free electronic log software if interpretation software is not being used. Log software may be down loaded from an electronic log system to view and print raster logs.
Numerous Benefits: Raster logs, routinely used by geologists, geophysicists and engineers in a host of applications from rank exploration to tertiary recovery is normally purchased on an as-needed basis, thusinterrupting a geoscientists workflow with the need to acquire new data and justify the cost.  This service should provide access to raster logs in the users study area, without having to stop, search for and purchase them. This means the user can build maps and cross sections faster and with less hassle.
Raster Log Hard Drive Delivery in PETRA , GeoGraphix, KINGDOM or other Format  should be available at an additional cost per Installation.
No formal solicitation is planned to be issued for this requirement.

<DESC>R09PS30017 A6 Turbine Seal Rings for Hoover Dam-NevadaNAICS: 331513 Steel Foundries (except Investment)PSC: J0428 Maint-rep of engines & turbines
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for new seal rings, ranging in size from 140" to 188" in diameter. The new seal rings will be installed on 130 megawatt (178,000 horsepower) hydroelectric Francis type turbines and will have running clearances no greater than 0.045" radial between the rotating and stationary seal rings. Past seal ring replacements utilized nickel-aluminum bronze paired against austenitic stainless steels such as CF8/304L. Wear rates observed using these materials were excessive, primarily on the aluminum bronze rings. Nitronic 60 stainless, with excellent mechanical properties, is now being used in place of the aluminum bronze to extend the life of the turbine seal rings and improving the long-term efficiency of the turbines at Hoover Dam.  
The principal components of the work include the following: 
(1) The stationary seal rings shall be fabricated as one piece, seamless and continuous either by centrifugal casting or ring roll forging;  
(2) The seal rings shall be furnished oversized relative to installation - final machining of the seal ring clearance surfaces will be done in the field by Hoover Dam staff to assure proper clearances between the stationary rings and runner as well as accurate pre-stressing of the rings during installation; 
(3) The seal rings shall be delivered in the fully annealed condition to insure minimal internal stresses and distortion during final machining operations by government personnel. The manufacturers suggested heat treatment procedure information, including intermediate "tempering", furnace type, and controls shall be reviewed by the Government prior to any heat treatment of the material. 
This solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 331513 Steel Foundries (except Investment) with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Quote (RFQ), will be issued on or about August 5, 2009 with offers due on or about August 19, 2009. The RFQ will include evaluation factors for experience, past performance, and price.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and two two-year option periods.  Fixed-price delivery orders will be issued as required to purchase the components.   The estimated magnitude of each task order is $5,000 to $100,000 with a total contract value of each contract awarded estimated between $100,000 - $5,000,000.  The estimated contract award date is September 14, 2009.
No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov. The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD if the FedBizOpps (FBO) web site becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register at the FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the FBO website after issuance download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Offerors are required to have a current registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.2.4.  The FAA currently has a contract with Adacel Systems, Inc. to design, develop, produce, install and test TSS at various sites utilizing their proprietary MaxSim 4 software.
The FAA has a requirement to procure the same software for 21 MaxSim Mobile Scenario Preparation Tool Stations (MSPTS).  Adacel Systems, Inc. currently licenses the use of their proprietary MaxSim 4 software to the FAA on the TSS.  The MSPTS gives the site the ability to develop visual database scenarios without interrupting training.  The FAA plans to deploy the MSPTS to those HUB sites that currently have the TSS and scheduled to receive the TSS.  It will be utilized to build scenarios for the Hub site and any satellite site designated to use the Hub site for training.  The hardware for MSPTS will be provided by the government.
The following characteristics describe the necessary functionality of the MSPTS: 
The scenario preparation tool (SPT) must be comprised of a set of graphical and tabular editing tools integrated on a single windows platform.  The SPT must have the ability to be used to configure and modify playing areas, airspace objects, airport objects, aircraft parameters, weather and other scenario data.  It also must provide the mechanisms to share data among currently installed Tower Simulation Systems within the FAA to allow data compression clean-up of databases, and to work with certain logs and reports.   
The graphical editing tool must allow a user to define airspace and airport features.  It must provide the drawing tools to set fixes, ground vertices (points), and route segments that define and modify the ground maneuvering areas and airborne navigation features.   This tool must also allow the ability to create background video maps for the radar displays.
The tabular editing tools must provide the designer with data tables and forms.  The SPT must provide the option to create scenarios from scratch or to copy, edit and save a previously designed scenario under a new name.  
The SPT must provide the means for users to configure, view and print logs and reports that are provided to assist the instructors in collecting training data and assessment information.  In addition, the SPT must provide system reports to assist the scenario designers in determining and correcting design data errors.  
The SPT must provide the option to be broken down into four parts; the establishment of general parameters, the definition of common data for a playing areas, the creation of scenario specific data, and generating the scenario. 
Data generated through the SPT is designed to accommodate upward compatibility within the TSS software and hardware systems subject to the constraints of the COTS component manufacturers when upgrades are required.
Any scenarios must be executable within the current Tower Simulation Systems installed within the FAA.
The following activities need to be performed without interruption of any ongoing training.
1.  Scenarios can be generated and tested using an interface.2.  Scenarios and playing areas are able to be transferred to the TSS via a     flash drive, or some compatible type of media.
Firms interested in participating in a competitive procurement for this requirement are requested to submit a capabilities statement which addresses each of the aforementioned functionalities.  It is requested that this statement also address the following:  
1.   Describe your experience and expertise in tower simulator software design and development.  2.   Identify any subcontractor or teaming arrangements that may be used to fulfill the requirements3.   Provide a completed Business Declaration Form (attached).
The FAA will use the capabilities statements to determine if adequate capability exists among vendors to conduct full and open competition. This is not a request for offers and The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this survey.
Interested firms should provide their capabilities statements electronically to the Contracting Officer at curtis.fields@faagov, or Contract Specialist at dawn.n.brown@faa.gov.  They may also be provided to the following address.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered RFQ AG-0116-S-09-0123, to Collect and Analyze Sediment Cores from Redoubt Lake project. If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective offerors should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after August 11, 2009, to obtain a copy of the solicitation.   This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201. However, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation. 

NOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. 
The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK. Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing. Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau). The solicitation contemplated by this notice will appear under the Ketchikan listing. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION. 

The purpose and intent of this contract is to secure services to:

1.	Collect at least 8 sediment cores from different locations within Redoubt Lake. Selection of core sampling sites shall be determined by examination of existing lake bathymetric maps.  Sites will be selected in areas of flat or gently sloping bathymetric gradients away from the influence of tributary streams.  

2.	Examine all cores collected and determine best cores for detailed analysis.  Analyze 1 or 2 cores in detail for stable isotope (&#61540;15N and &#61540;13C) and in-lake primary productivity indicator (organic carbon and biogenic silica) analyses of bulk sediment sub-samples.  Perform sediment radioisotope dating chronology analysis on one core. 

3.	Dating chronology analysis shall be accomplished using a combination of 137Cs and 210Pb radioisotope analyses.  This is the most widely applied method for dating recently deposited lake sediments.  This dating analysis allows an estimation of sediment chronologies and accumulation rates during the last 150 years.  This method has proved to be very reliable in stable environments with uniform sediment accumulation rates with unambiguous dating calculations (Appleby 2002).  If necessary a third Radiocarbon (14C) isotope dating may also be used in combination with the other dating methods to determine the age of terrestrial organic matter (leaves, seeds, etc.) recovered from down core sub samples from the lower portion of the core.  Stable isotope (&#61540;15N and &#61540;13C) and the percent carbon and nitrogen will be measured on dry bulk sediment down core sub samples.  Stable isotope analyses will be accomplished using continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CFIRMS).  Stable isotope ratios will be reported in &#61540; (delta) notation as parts per thousand (0/00) deviation from the international standards PDB (carbon) and air (nitrogen).  All analyses will be performed by an established stable isotope analysis laboratory with experience in sediment isotope determinations.  

4.	Use sediment &#61540;15N results and existing adult escapement data from Redoubt Lake to potentially identify historical proxy sockeye salmon escapement levels and population trends prior to commercial exploitation. Sediment samples will be selected to yield the highest temporal resolution possible in an attempt to correlate these analyses with the existing escapement data.

5.	Prepare and present a final report of the research results for submission to the US Forest Service.

  The Contractor must furnish all labor, equipment, housing, subsistence, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals.

<RESPDATE>080609
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB), plans to procure the brand name AKTA Purifier 10 Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System (FPLC) manufactured GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, NJ 08855. 

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Part I -Background Information and Description of the Requirement

The Laboratory of Cellular & Molecular Biology (LCMB), studies Arf GAP proteins related to tumor invasion, in particular ASAP1, ASAP3 and AGAP1/2 proteins and compares these to Arf GAPs involved in constitutive membrane traffic such as Arf GAP 1. The principle aim of the enzymological studies is to determine catalytic differences between Arf GAPs that have been implicated in cancer and those that have constitutive activities in cells, with the goal of developing therapeutics that target the Arf GAPs. This work is highly dependent on purifying proteins using chromatography instruments. Both recombinant and endogenous proteins are purified from a variety of sources using state of the art chromatography materials. 

All methods have been developed over the past 15 years using equipment and supplies available through GE-Healthcare. Because the chromatography media are proprietary, purification schemes would have to be redeveloped if we were to use supplies and equipment from another company, which could take months to years. Therefore, purchase of a chromatography instrument that is compatible with the other GE Healthcare instruments in the laboratory is critical to ensure that work will be consistent and not be interrupted by equipment failure.
	
Part II - Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.  Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

		(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization.

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.   




The following Salient Characteristics apply to the AKTA 10 Purifier FPLC:

•	 Compatible with the existing systems in the laboratory

•	 Capacity to purify proteins 

•	A required flow rate range of 0.001-10 mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-25 MPa (0325 psi)

•	Must be a twp-pump gradient system with dynamic mixing

Justification

	The utilization of salt buffers requires the entire wetted flow path of the system be inert to halides. The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing in PEEK. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques. The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based. The system must include a motorized valve for sample injection. In order to facilitate cleaning, storage, selection of our various chromatographic columns, and further automation the system must have the ability to control 8 more motorized valves for a total 9 motorized valves. This is necessary for buffer selection, injection, flow diversion, diverting peaks to sample loops etc. Also, the motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times. The valves should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate. GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences is the manufacturer of the AKTA Purifier 10 FLPC which is the only system known to the NCI capable of performing the tasks outlined in this procurement. For these reasons, NCI has deemed GE Healthcare to be sole source provider for this acquisition.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on August 6, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference NCI-90138-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  FAR Part 6 – Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). 
This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35 (as of June 15, 2009).
The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 
The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516, and the business size standard is 500.
Market Research Conducted by the Government, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that only Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc. can perform/provide the requisite supplies/services specified herein.
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Highland Park PO Box 998, Winooski, Vermont 05404 for the following:
This request for a BioTek EL 406 Combination Microplate Washer and Dispenser is to enable this facility too screen prospective DNA and drug targets: 
The EL406 is a combination washer dispenser that can both wash and accurately dispense solutions to microplate wells. 
This item is needed to facilitate NIH's RNAi screening program. This program is to provide intramural researchers with access to the equipment and expertise necessary to conduct genome-wide RNAi screens in mammalian cells. This facility will work as a collaborative resource for doing RNAi assay development, screening, and initial follow up. The EL406 will be used for a wide variety of applications. In general, the EL406 will be used to gently remove media from siRNA-transfected adherent cells in microplates (capable of handling 96, 384, and 1536 well microplates). Once the exisiting media is removed, the EL406 will be used to wash and accurately dispense fresh assay-specific reagents to the cells. The EL406 will be purchased with an integrated BioTek microplate stacker, which will greatly enhance throughput and provide walk-away capabilities.
The EL406 is unique because it is the only combination washer dispenser on the market that can wash and dispense 96, 384, and 1536 well plates where washing a full 96-well plates at one time is still possible. The EL406 also has four separate fluid paths, including 1 periplastic pump, 2 syringe fluid paths, and 1 wash buffer path; The EL406 allows for up to 7 different fluids to be passed through the 4 different paths.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the establishment of a repository of drug abuse and HIV research data primarily including social science and behavioral data including 1) "marketing" the concept to drug abuse social science researchers, 2) providing technical assistance and financial support to investigators in preparing their data for archiving, 3) informing the field on what datasets are available for secondary analysis and displaying the utility of this approach for addressing new research questions, 4) providing technical assistance to users of the data sets including organized trainings when a critical mass of interested parties has accumulated, and 5) providing support to principal investigators with high priority NIDA data (i.e., Longitudinal, HIV/AIDS, health disparities, and comorbities.)<br />The NIDA has funded many datasets in the social and behavioral sciences and is now pursuing archiving these datasets and making them available to other researchers in the field. ICPSR is readily available to provide the services of data archiving, technical assistance to investigators preparing their data for archiving, technical assistance to investigators accessing and analyzing archived datasets, and training in secondary data use. Having been in existence since 1962, ICPSR is the recognized leader in the field of data archiving, data dissemination and documentation, advanced research training and related activities. ICPSR is considered the largest archive of digital social science data in the world. Many factors contribute to their position in the field, including physical capabilities, staff on the cutting edge in both technology and the science of data sharing.</p>
<p>ICPSR employs a full time staff who are experts in process improvement and have analyzed existing processes using this knowledge to develop new ones leading to increased productivity. Their automated processes for creating codebooks and datasets in multiple formats significantly improves efficiencies for archiving. Their automated cataloging and data release procedures reduce the number of steps staff must perform when making data available for public release. These procedures, called the &lsquo;ICPSR Data Pipeline' take the data that is received and prepare it for access and preservation. During this process, ICPSR also evaluates the data quality, creates new metadata (descriptive, administrative, etc.) and enhances the overall data product with methodological techniques. In addition, ICPSR has developed automated processes for creating codebooks that have been used in archiving other NIH data. These processes can be used for drug abuse data and NIDA will not have to incur the expense of developing these processes. The fact that these procedures are already established within this organization will result in shorter start time for this project and cost savings and ensure the usability of the data products.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is for a base period of 12 months with the options of up to four one-year option periods.<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Manneheim Research Institute for the Economics of Aging, Department of Economics, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany for enhancement of data comparability and cross-national comparisons of health and economic well-being of older adults, NIA is providing support to an ongoing data collection effort being coordinated by Mannheim University. Data comparability will be enhanced by aligning interviewer training, adapting recruitment techniques, and by the introduction of objective "performance-based" measures currently included in other US and international population based surveys of the elderly. To enhance the value of existing surveys, and to encourage the introduction of these measures in other international surveys, NIA is supporting the adoption of these techniques by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the wide release and use of these harmonized data. These harmonization measures will permit cross-national comparisons, enabling researchers to ask questions about the relative health and economic well-being of older Americans in the global context, providing insights on the impact of health care systems and utilization, social cohesion and family structure and begin to address differences in life expectancy. SHARE is designed after the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), and this support is intended to enhance harmonization within these datasets and enhance the comparability of these measures to those in other US datasets, as well as other datasets being collected both in the US and cross-nationally, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), the Established Population for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), and Longitudinal Aging Study of Amsterdam (LASA.)<br />SHARE is an incredibly powerful and useful dataset; it is a multidisciplinary and cross-national panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks of more than 40,000 individuals aged 50 or over, representing 16 countries. Much of the ongoing research and policy development surrounding the elderly in Europe utilizes these data that have been collected and tabulated by these survey teams; no comparable dataset exists, and certainly not one which includes the same depth of information on retirement, economic behavior and savings, as well as health utilization and outcomes. NIA wishes to harmonize this survey, with its longitudinal dataset, nationally representative sample of 16 nations, with other international datasets of similar quality and depth, and only Mannheim University and the SHARE survey team, lead by survey coordinator Axel Boersch-Supan, have access to the survey infrastructure and the existing data and possess the capacity to integrate these new items and practices into future waves of this survey.</p>
<p><br />The anticipated period of performance is for a base period of 12 months with the options of up to four one-year option periods.<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>Under the statutory authority provided by 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and  FAR subpart 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to issue sole source solicitation to Pacific Instruments Incorporated 4080 Pike Ln. Concord California. An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated for the procurement of up to twenty five (25) sixteen (16) channel system enclosure (Model No. 5810), one hundred fifty (150) three (3) channel digital ruggedized Ethernet data recorder enclosure, (Model No. 5871) with 110 VAC power supply (Model 5891), one hundred (100) 2 MS/s, 14-bit, 2Mbyte memory transducer recorder channel module (Model No. 5842), five hundred (500) 200 KS/s, 24-bit, 1Mbyte memory transducer recorder channel module (Model No. 5843) and fifteen (15) Command Encoder, Optic, 12 VDC (Model No. 5883)with 110 VAC Power Supply (Model 5891).  Two additional CLINs shall be included for the repair services of the recorders and technology upgrades to the recorders. The proposed contract period of performance is five (5) years.  The proposed acquisition will be awarded  in accordance with FAR 13.5 - Test Program for the Acquisition of Certain Commercial Items. Pacific Instruments is the only company which can provide the Three Channel Digital Recording Modules compatible with the equipment currently being used by NSWCCD and the recording modules software is proprietary to Pacific Instruments.  The new recorders to be purchased must be compatible with existing equipment currently being used by the Survivability and Weapons Effects Department, Dynamic Measurements Branch (Code 663). To facilitate data processing and the derivation of transfer functions, it is necessary for the electrical characteristics to be identical for all channels in a particular test. Also, to provide an automated error free measurement system the software programming commands and data structures must be identical for all channels of the system. The recorder setup software use to configure the recorders is proprietary to Pacific Instruments. Because of project commitments, the department is in the process of extending the recording capability of our Pacific Instruments data acquisition systems currently used to obtain data during the shock testing of operating combatant ships, submarines and test vehicles. The department has developed its entire data acquisition system around these data recorders. The installation and mounting hardware is designed to interface with these recorders.  It would not be cost effective to the Government to dispose of the current system and change to a new unproven system.  The cost to redesign the infrastructure required to install, control and operate a new unproven system would exceed $3,000,000.
Interested parties may express their interests and submit their capabilities by contacting the point contact listed in this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement, and will be solely within the discretion of the Government.(see numbered note 22)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Subpart 13.5 -- Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (as supplemented with additional information included in this notice). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

AUTHORIZED RESELLERS, which will be delivered to the Receiving Officer, 6620 Tisdale Road, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, VA  22448. The Technology Integration Assessment Center (TIAC) requires these devices to tap multiple full-duplex networks and combine the cumulative traffic onto a single stream for output to multiple monitoring tools.  These products are unique in that all aggregation taps are passive (failsafe) hardware devices that provide complete traffic visibility while keeping the network unaffected by the monitoring infrastructure.  The tap appliance is invisible to the network and shields monitoring tools from detection and the possibility of polluting network data. There will be no written solicitation issued as a result of this notification.  Please reference NSWC Request for Quote (RFQ) # N00178-09-Q-2077.   Interested parties may submit their quotes/bids to the following: dana.strickland@navy.mil.  This solicitation is expected to close on or about 07 August 2009, with award expected on or before 14 August 2009 and delivery to the fleet no later than 15 September 2009.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center intends to negotiate and award a sole source indefinite quantity contract  to ACG Security, LLC, Fredericksburg, VA for  up to twenty  Route Clearing Patrol Recorders (RCP-R) for the US ARMY Rapid Equipping Force.  The REF requires a smaller, improved version of its Immersive Viewing Recording System (IVRS) currently in use by soldiers in OIF that was developed and provided by ACG Security. The REF concept is to rapidly procure a smaller quickly deployed and installed, man- portable version of the IVVRS system for military operations OCONUS. The improved system will be backward compatible with the IVVRS camera array system and include all upgrades incorporated into that system. The RCP-R systems must meet Army Test and Evaluation Commands safety and performance standards for release to soldiers in OIF and OEF. The camera arrays will consist of the vehicle mounted camera systems designed for IVRS and additional lowlight capable, interchangeable camera heads. The post processing system will be greatly reduced in size and complexity to eliminate the need for a large, heavy, server sans storage array, and to minimize post-processing time and labor. The man-portable processors allow for one processing station per camera array that is easily relocated as opposed to a large centrally located processing station that supports five independent camera arrays and takes weeks and special equipment to move. A soldier must be able to operate the system after minimal training and the RCP-R must be compatible with TIGR patrol report system and SIPR Networks. The improved system must be backward compatible with the existing IVRS system.<BR><BR>The Route Clearing Patrol Recorders consists of two <BR>major subsystems: the Mobile Unit and the Portable Ops Center Unit. The mobile unit consists of a digital camera array, a digital video recorder (DVR) and an external mounted independent power system. The Portable Ops Center Unit must function as a editing and analysis station and provides 4 Terra Bytes of route storage.  It shall have the ability to manage the data, removing/archiving vignettes and related data as it becomes dated/replaced/updated.  The Portable Ops Center Unit consists of two major components: Editing Station and the Analysis Station that meet specific technical criteria and capabilities.<BR>The contractor will also provide Spare Part Kits, installation and training on the system in an OCONUS combat environment for a maximum of 120 days to install the systems and to provide operations and maintenance training to the units receiving the systems or other REF designated personnel. <BR>The anticipated period of performance for this effort is three years. Contractor must be capable of providing deliverables in one hundred and eighty days or less from time of award. <BR><BR>Interested small businesses that are certified and qualified as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern are encouraged to submit their capability packages outlining their experience and capability to develop the systems and provide the support described in the aforementioned key areas and tasks. Request interested firms submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to this office to include, but is not limited to: (1) a summary of similar, recent (within the last three fiscal years) performance history (including points of contact with applicable telephone and fax numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses, as available) as well as identifying in what capacity the work was performed (e.g. prime contractor, consultant, subcontractor, etc.); (2) a description of subcontractors and identification of type of work and % of overall value of the contract that they will perform and a description of the facilities and identification and resumes of key personnel that would be used to accomplish the effort; and (3) the firms business size status. Responses must be received no later than 3:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time on 31 July 2009. Responses to this notice will assist the Government in determining potential sources and is not a request to be considered for a contract award. Currently ACG is the only known source capable of providing the required personnel in the timeframe necessary.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
This statement of work describes the maintenance and services for the Government-owned vehicles located at the Exercise Support Division (ESD), Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twenty-nine Palms, CA 92278.  The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, equipment, management and supervision, to perform the repair, mounting and dismounting of split rim tires.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal (including MCAGCC), State and Local regulations, laws and requirements, in performance of this contract.
The vehicles to be serviced include the Container handler, RT Kalmar Ind., (tire size 29.5R35).  The contractor shall remove the flat tire from the wheel while the wheel remains on the vehicle.  The task requires that the contractor raise the vehicle using a 40-50 ton (or equivalent) jack and remove the flat tire with the proper tools.  The contractor shall install a new tire, which will be provided by the Government while the wheel remains on the vehicle.  These tasks will be performed at the ESD vehicle parking lot, in an area prescribed by the Government.  The old tire shall become the property of the contractor, who shall remove it from the Combat Center and be responsible for it thereafter.  Should the contractor recommend that the wheel be removed from the vehicle for any reason, work shall stop and the vendor shall consult with the Government as to how or if to proceed.  The vendor will not be required to remove the wheel from the vehicle.
Other vehicles include the Tractor, Articulated street, MR Tram, (tire size 20.5-25), the Grader, Road, Motorized, (tire size 13.00-24TG) and MAC 50 (tire size 445/95R25).  The Government shall remove the flat tire and the split-rim wheel from the vehicle.  The contractor will pick-up and transport the tire/wheel assembly and a new tire, which will be provided by the government from the ESD vehicle parking lot, to its facility, or the contractor may change the tire in an area prescribed by the Government but only with Government approval.  The contractor will dismount the flat tire, and install the new Government furnished tire onto the Government supplied split-rim wheel. It shall be the responsibility of the vendor to insure that the Government furnished equipment is returned to the Government.  The Government shall put in place a process to insure that equipment provided to the vendor is validated upon return as Government property.  In the event that the contractor determines that the Government supplied wheel is not acceptable for reuse, the contractor will return the wheel to the government for evaluation.  If the Government agrees that the wheel is unacceptable for reuse, the government will provide a replacement wheel to the contractor.  The removed tires shall become the property of the contractor, for reuse or disposal.
When ESD requires the contractor to perform these services it shall notify the MCAGCC Contract Specialist, and the contractor, of the requirement.  The contractor shall change the tire on the Container Handler with 48 Hours (not including weekends), after receiving notification from ESD.  The contractor shall pick up the flat tires and used wheels for the other vehicles, within 48 hours (not including weekends), of receiving notification from ESD.  The contractor shall return the used wheels and new tires in operable condition, to ESD within 72 hours (not including weekends) of picking them up from ESD.  ESD will be responsible for establishing a system that tracks the type of wheel repaired and the number of times repairs are done on a monthly basis.  This system will be used to reconcile the Contractor invoices that will be submitted on a semi-monthly, monthly or bi-monthly basis.

<DESC>STRATEGIC ASSET MANAGEMENT(Real Property Asset Management)July 24, 2009INTRODUCTION: This is not a solicitation.  As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist us in developing a acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications for a potential future requirement associated with the Strategic Asset Management (SAM) component of the Financial & Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise (FLITE) Program.  More specifically, VA is seeking industry input related to Real Property Asset Management.  BACKGROUND:  VA's SAM system is charged with establishing a centralized repository and tool for requisitioning, purchasing, tracking and disposing of assets, supply inventories and related work management in a single system accessible throughout the department.  VA is currently implementing IBM's Maximo Enterprise Suite as its enterprise asset management platform for personal property assets, supply inventories, and work management.  VA is interested in a solution that will extend these capabilities to include Real Property Asset Management.  This Real Property Asset Management solution may utilize Maximo and/or COTS product(s) that are compatible with Maximo.  VA aims to use commercial off the shelf (COTS) software with minimal extensions and customizations.  VA will use the application to manage and track its real property portfolio.  This includes approximately 9,250 buildings and 2,500 parcels of land.  VA projects approximately 4,800 users will utilize the real property asset management solution.  VA's business requirements are described in the Attachment to this announcement entitled, "FLITE Real Property Business Requirements."  Specifically in the attachment, Section 3 contains a description of the system features that VA anticipates in the COTS solution (Please note that some of the features are identified as core, while others are identified as optional - VA seeks information on both the core and optional features as described below); Section 4 contains the functional requirements (business processes) that VA expects the solution to support; Section 5 contains the reporting requirements; Section 6 contains non-functional requirements; Section 7 contains a data model.  INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY:  Request interested parties provide information for the following areas: 1) Provide information on the COTS component(s) that might make up the overall solution.  Include information on application compatibility, including supporting database management systems and operating systems; client architecture (such as web-based or client/server); performance impact; and scalability.  Include information on the product's ability to integrate with the Maximo Enterprise Suite via the Maximo Enterprise Adaptor, as well as integration with a financial management system.  2) Provide a narrative overview of the software's ability to support the core features, functions, data, and reporting needs identified in Section 3.1 - 3.6 and Sections 4 - 7 of the attachment.   Please specify any functional areas that may require extensions or customization.3) Provide a narrative overview of software's ability to support the three geospatial features identified in sections 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 of the attachment.  Additionally, provide an overview of the activities necessary to define the geospatial land and building maps within the system.4)  Provide a narrative overview of the software's ability to support the user-defined management triggers feature that is described in section 3.7 of the attachment.  5)  Provide a narrative overview of the software's ability to support the robust data upload feature that is described in section 3.8 of the attachment.6) Describe the largest effort you have completed to-date to implement the product(s). 7) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate assuming the implementation of the core real property requirements will consist of a pilot implementation and deployment at a single medical center followed by national deployment, a 12 month period for development and implementation at the pilot site and an 18 month period for deployment at the remaining sites, and that the solution will be hosted at a VA Data Center.  The ROM should take into account Software Licenses to support approximately 4,800 users, hardware required to implement and deploy the solution, effort required to implement the product, and development of training materials and delivery of training to 4,800 end-users.   Please provide a ROM estimate for the core requirements, as well as a separate breakout for the optional features.8) Statement of whether your firm is classified as a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone business, woman-owned small business or veteran-owned small business or service disabled veteran-owned small business in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 541511.  SPECIFIC RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please submit your response to this RFI in accordance with the following: 1) "White" paper format with no more than 20 pages (excluding transmittal page)  Include the name, email address and phone number of the appropriate representative of your company; 2) Address each of the 8 topics described above; 3) Submit your response via email to Daniel.Winterroth@va.gov; 4) Submit your response by 1:00 P.M. Central Time on August 7, 2009; 5) Mark your response as "Proprietary Information" if the information is considered business sensitive.  ROAD AHEAD:  White Paper responses submitted by interested firms will be used as part of market research by VA representatives to assist in planning possible future technical requirements and developing possible acquisition alternatives, should this announcement lead to an actual procurement.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.

VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.

If the Government does elect to hold a Pre-Solicitation Conference, either the Pre-Solicitation Synopsis, or the resulting issued Solicitation, will be adjusted accordingly. At this time, no ORGANIZED SITE VISIT is planned for this Solicitation. If the government does elect to schedule an organized site visit, the details will be included in the resulting issued Solicitation. At this time, no OPTIONS AND/OR ALTERNATES have been identified for this project. If the Price Schedule is changed to include Options, prior to the release of the Solicitation, then the Pre-Solicitation Synopsis will be modified accordingly. If the Price Schedule is changed to include Options, after the resulting Solicitation has been issued, then the Solicitation will be Amended accordingly. In accordance with FAR 36.204 and VAAR 836.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is: (f) "Between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000." The resulting Solicitation will be issued as a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) which will result in the award of a Single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Construction Contract. The estimated performance period for completion of construction is ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) calendar days from Notice to Proceed (NTP). If the performance period is changed prior to the release of the Solicitation, the resulting Solicitation will establish the official performance period under the FAR Clause 52.211-10 -- Commencement, Prosecution, and Completion of Work. If the performance period is changed after release of the Solicitation, the Solicitation will be Amended accordingly. SCHEDULED OPENING & CLOSING DATES. This Solicitation will be available, on or about, 08-10-2009 and the Proposals will be due, on or about, 09-09-2009. The issued Solicitation, including any Amendments, shall establish the official opening and closing dates and times. Proposals received in response to this Solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offer (LPTA). The following significant evaluation factors have been identified as the basis for award: FACTOR 1: PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE. To be technically acceptable, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Construction Firms who submit an offer must provide evidence that they have already performed at least one construction project that involved: (a) Work as a Prime Contractor under the same NAICS code as this project (238210 -- Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors); and (b) Work of a dollar amount that falls within the exact same estimated magnitude of this project, which is between $1,000,00 and $2,000,000 (as listed above).  FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS. To be technically acceptable, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Construction Firms who submit an offer must provide information regarding the technical qualifications of the proposed project staff, to include the individuals who will be responsible for: (a) Project Management; (b) Quality Control; and (c) Safety Compliance. A brief resume of each key individual will be evaluated to determine if they meet the technical requirements for a project of this nature. It is acceptable for a single individual to perform more than one of these functions, as long as the proposal identifies which function(s) the individual will be performing. FACTOR 3: PRICE. As a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection, award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Note that offers that are not Technically Acceptable cannot be selected, regardless of Price. NOTE: The actual issued Solicitation will include a detailed list of all evaluation factors, including any subfactors or elements, and will provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award. Any changes to evaluation factors may only be issued by amendment. NAICS CODE & SBA SIZE STANDARD: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 238210 -- Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors, with a Small Business Size Standard of $14.0 Million. For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a Small Business if its Annual Average Gross Revenue, taken for the last 3 Fiscal Years, does not exceed the Size Standard as stated above. THIS SOLICITATIN WILL BE ISSUED AS A TOTAL SERVICED-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) SET-ASIDE. Therefore, in accordance with Public Law 109-461, as Codified in 38 U.S.C. Section 8127, all responsible SDVOSB sources, that are properly registered in the VetBizRegistry Vendor Information Pages (VIP) located at www.VetBiz.gov , may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. The applicable SDVOSB qualification standards will be listed in the resulting issued Solicitation. PERFORMANCE OF WORK BY PRIME CONTRACTOR. Because this SDVOSB Set-Aside Solicitation is for Specialty Trade Construction under NAICE Code 238210 -- Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors (as described above), at least TWENTY FIVE PERCENT (25%) of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel must be spent on the concerns employees or the employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. INFORMATION ON HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. This Solicitation, with Plans, Specifications, and any Amendments, will be published in electronic format as an Electronic Bid Set (EBS) at the Fed Biz Opps website, http://www.fbo.gov . There will be no printed hard copies or CD-ROM Disks provided by the agency.  Interested parties can only access the Solicitation, including any Amendments, at the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fbo.gov . The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offerors inability to access the document at the referenced website. Firms should also register as Plan Holders, at the above Internet Site, in order to receive notification, via email, of any new Amendments to the resulting Solicitation, and/or Special Announcements. INFORMATION ON CCR REQUIREMENTS.

If assistance is needed with CCR registration, contact the CCR Helpdesk at 1-888-227-2423. INFORMATION ON ORCA REQUIREMENTS. There is a Federal initiative called the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of most of the Representations and Certifications (Reps & Certs) required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which were previously included, in full text, in Construction Solicitations. According to FAR case 2002-024, it has been mandatory for Vendors to use ORCA since 01 January 2005. Therefore, to be eligible for a Contract Award, an Offeror MUST be registered in this database prior to submitting a bid and/or proposal. Register your Representations and Certifications (Reps & Certs) at the ORCA Website, http://orca.bpn.gov . Note that detailed background information, frequently asked questions, and useful instructions can be found by visiting the help section of the ORCA website.  INFORMATION FOR ACCESS TO THE "INTERESTED VENDORS LIST" (ILV) AND "WATCH LIST" FUNCTIONS AT FED BIZ OPPS. It should be noted that plan holders lists are no longer maintained at contracting offices, because of changes in Federal Acquisition Regulations to emphasize the utilization of internet/web-based technology.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratories, Eglin AFB, FL&nbsp;has a requirement for a &nbsp;rectangular test chamber to house small scale detonations for an&nbsp;explosive weight of 2 grams or less TNT equivalence.&nbsp; These detonations must be conducted inside a controlled environment (IE Not out doors) because precision alignment of optical diagnostics will be used to measure the output of detonators.&nbsp; The test chamber will also need to be deemed "man safe".&nbsp; This is a safety feature that will allow one to direct high energy laser light onto the detonator and still work in the room without danger of being harmed if in the worst case scenario, the laser initiates the explosive.&nbsp; Pressure, heat, and fragment measurements will be taken by the vendor to verify this safety condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The item required is a high explosive containment vessel with options 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1 is software analysis to calculate the pressure that the 1 inch alls of the chamber will be able to contain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2 is a software analysis to determine the maximum quantity of explosive that can be used without affecting the "man rating".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 3 is the testing of the chamber per MIL-STD 398 to ensure that the chamber is "man safe"</p>

These neat chemicals are pure, undiluted<br />chemicals, in either solid or liquid form, that are sufficient to meet the stringent criteria<br />for purity, stability, storage, and traceability stipulation in the International Standards ISO<br />9001 and 17025 and PDP Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Each standard must be<br />accompanied by a current and valid "Certificate of Analysis" which shall contain, at a<br />minimum, the substance and its verified purity, the production lot number, traceability,<br />and a current expiration date. It is essential that the thirteen PDP laboratories obtain their<br />analytical standards from the same qualified vendors whenever possible to minimize any<br />differences across the program to provide data integrity.<br />IV. Requirements:<br />a. Certified pure (neat) pesticide residue analytical-grade chemicals as identified in<br />Attachment 1. It must be noted that not all these compounds will be<br />tested/procured by each laboratory each year; rather, this is a potential list of<br />chemicals. A laboratory's need for a particular item depends on whether they<br />need new (unexpired) standard at a given time and whether or not they are tasked<br />to test that chemical on that commodity - each laboratory has a different<br />commodity assignment each year and each commodity is tested for a separate host<br />of chemicals. The attached list is a universal list of all chemicals tested by the<br />program across all commodities. The vendor must be able to provide 95% of<br />these chemicals at any given time.<br />b. The vendor must have a Quality System registered to ISO 9001.<br />c. The vendor must have an in-house (i.e., on the premises) testing facility<br />accredited to ISO 17025 in the field of Chemical Testing. The accreditation shall<br />be specified as, at minimum:<br />i. Testing of chemical reference standards, neats<br />ii. Measurement of analyte identification and concentration<br />iii. Capability for measurement via GC, GC/FID, GC/ECD, GC/MSD, HPLC,<br />FT-IR<br />iv. Measurements for neat chemicals must be accurate to within &plusmn; 5%<br />d. Each chemical must be accompanied by a current and valid "Certificate of<br />Analysis" which shall contain, at a minimum, the substance identity and its<br />verified purity, the production lot number, traceability, and a current expiration<br />date.<br />e. Neat standards must have a high purity. For example, at last 90% of the chemical<br />must have a certified purity of 98.0% or higher.<br />f. Neat standards must have a minimum of two-thirds shelf-life remaining when<br />issued.<br />g. Time from order to shipment must be rapid - i.e., preferably 24-48 hours.<br />h. Shipment may be via UPS ground.</p>
<p>Interested manufactures should send a statement of capabilities via email to Leigh Eberhart at Leigh.D.Eberhart@aphis.usda.gov</p>

15. TAPE CAST OR SPLINT SYNTHETIC NYLON KNIT REINFORCED STRIP 3/4inW 5yd IRON ON


The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.


The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary. When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors’ initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Casting Supplies – Tapes. A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTFs’ requirements for ‘usage items’ in the product line.  ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.

Upon completion of the Phase I – Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

1. TAPE CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS 3inW 4ydL CASTING GLOVES LATEX-FREE
2. TAPE CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS 4inW 4ydL CASTING GLOVES LATEX-FREE

15. TAPE CAST OR SPLINT SYNTHETIC NYLON KNIT REINFORCED STRIP 3/4inW 5yd IRON ON

	
1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The casting tape is moldable and easily conforms over the contours of the affected body part 
a The casting tape must be resilient and durable making it easy to mold over difficult contours
b. The evaluator will apply the casting tape (fiberglass or plaster) observing the handling characteristics, conformability, and contour molding 
            c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”. 
2. The casting tape rolls uniformly.
            a. The casting tape must roll uniformly to provide adequate handling during application 
            to avoid wrinkles which lead to skin irritation           
b. While applying the fiberglass cast tape, the evaluator will observe that the tape roll stays in place while unrolling providing uniformity with ease of handling 
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.
3. The casting tape consistency allows for quick set times.
            a. The cast tape (plaster or fiberglass) must set quickly to ensure the casted limb is 
            maintained in the desired position
b. The evaluator will observe that plaster or fiberglass cast has hardened and set within an acceptable time frame maintaining the desired body part position 
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.


Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [“The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified via e-mail regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors’ initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I – Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

1. SYSTEM CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS ROLL 4inWx 15ftL FOAM PADDING STOCKINETTE COVER
2. SYSTEM CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS ROLL 3inWx 15ftL FOAM PADDING STOCKINETTE COVER
3. SYSTEM CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS ROLL 5inWx 15ftL FOAM PADDING STOCKINETTE COVER
4. CAST OR SPLINT PLASTER PRE-CUT CREAMY 5inW 30inL 5-8 min FAST
5. SYSTEM CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS ROLL 6inWx 15ftL FOAM PADDING STOCKINETTE COVER
6. SYSTEM CAST SPLINT FIBERGLASS ROLL 2inW 15ftL FOAM PADDING STOCKINETTE COVER
7. BANDAGE PLASTER GAUZE CREAMY 5-8 MINUTE FAST 4inW 5yd
8. CAST OR SPLINT PLASTER PRE-CUT 4inW 15inL 5-8 min FAST
9. BANDAGE PLASTER GAUZE CREAMY 5-8 MINUTE FAST 3inW 3ydL


1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The pre-formed (plaster or fiberglass) splint is moldable for precise fit providing the necessary support 
a The pre-formed (plaster or fiberglass) splint must be moldable to allow for exact fit and smooth finish immobilizing the body part 
b. During and after application, the evaluator will assess the pre-cut (plaster or fiberglass) splint visualizing the precise fit and firm support for the affected body part 
            c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”. 
2. The application of the splinting system can be done with a wrinkle-free finish eliminating pressure points 
            a. The splinting system must be wrinkle-free.  Wrinkles in materials cause pressure points 
            which can cause skin break down and/or injury to the supported limb 
b. The evaluator, during and after the splint application, will visually inspect the splint for any presence of wrinkles 
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [“The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified via e-mail regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors’ initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Casting Supplies – Padding & Stockinette.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The cast padding readily tears allowing uniform padding application over body contours. 
a. The padding must tear evenly and smoothly aiding the uniform molding process preventing unnecessary pressure against the patient’s skin or bony prominences promoting skin breakdown
b. The evaluator will apply the padding to the body area that is needed observing the ability of the padding to functionally tear aiding the process to provide a smooth surface for the casting tape
            c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”. 
2. The cast padding readily molds for a uniform application over body contours.
            a. The padding must provide uniform molding so that it does not put unnecessary 
             pressure against the patient’s skin or bony prominences preventing skin breakdown.
b. The evaluator will apply the padding to the body area that is needed and mold it to fit the body contour observing the ability of the padding to uniformly conform providing a smooth surface for the casting tape
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.
3. The stockinet conforms to the shape of the anatomy 
a As the foundation layer for a cast, stockinet material must provide a smooth precise shape of the anatomy to build the cast upon 
b. The evaluator will apply the stockinet for casting observing the ability of the stockinette to mold to the contour of the anatomy 
            c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”. 
4. The stockinet provides smooth coverage not wrinkling or slipping during application.
            a. The stockinet material must stretch to fit over body parts but have memory to recoil to 
            prevent stockinet slippage or wrinkling under cast material 
b. The evaluator will inspect the applied stockinet for wrinkles and sagging areas c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.
5. The stockinet stretches and cuts smoothly 
            a. The stockinet material should be stretchable and can be cut without unraveling or 
            fraying to provide a smooth casting edge 
b. In the process of applying the stockinet the evaluator will stretch the material and cut the material to the required length or fit visually inspecting the stockinet for unraveling or fraying. 
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.
6. The stockinet can be folded evenly over padding for a soft protective edge.
a. The casting tape or plaster hardens and can rub or irritate the skin.  The stockinet 
folded over the padded layer forms a soft edge to protect the skin.
b. After application of all casting layers the evaluator will stretch and fold 
the stockinet over the cast edges and examines the edge for hard or sharp points 
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in “b”.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [“The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

<DESC>I. STATEMENT OF NEED
The Tongass National Forest recently finished its Forest Plan Amendment (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/2008_Forest_Plan.pdf). As part of the amendment there is a need to have and or develop a model for projects, to implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Record_of_Decision.pdf) (as described in Record of Decision for 2008 Forest Plan Amendment). The Tongass National Forest needs to develop project plans that allow phased implementation of the Forest Plan as described in the recent Record of Decision to project the development of forest conditions over time to quantify the effects on young growth management as it applies to wildlife habitats and to determine a sustainable harvest level at the project level. The implementation of the Adaptive Management Strategy requires the use of a proven vegetation model with the ability to (a) handle large data sets associated with analyzing forest lands with multiple land use allocations (and complex goal rule sets to be simulated); (b) calculate timber harvest level and potential outputs considering the Forest management goals, objectives, and constraints; (c) project the effects on wildlife habitats; and (d) to perform both cost and revenue (financial efficiency) analyses based on alternative management strategies with potential to help evaluate costs factors and trade-offs as the Tongass moves into young growth management.  We seek the flexibility to account for and generate spatial and temporal changes resulting from the implementation of any alternative. We seek to adopt a spatial simulation model which will help us develop a range of alternative, feasible land management projects. We seek a model to provide information appropriate to the development of implementable designs for actual on-the-ground projects that meet Forest Plan direction and display progress towards the forest’s desired future condition (DFC). The model should provide a spatially explicit display of the development of the forest conditions and key habitat baselines that move project to DFC. The model should provide a means of constraining and projecting silvicultural treatments while tracking effects on each specific polygon for each year and providing a variety of useful outputs. The inputs and outputs of the model should meet operational and habitat needs and help forest planners for feasible land management projects for our land base. Alternatives developed to implement the Tongass Timber Sale Program Adaptive Management Strategy will need to project the development of forest conditions over time to quantify the effects on wildlife habitat and to determine a sustainable harvest level that allows the ability to incorporate newer deer models, such as Hanley’s FRESH Deer Model (http://cervid.uaa.alaska.edu/deer/). We seek a model wherein constraints and targets can be set for both annual and periodic (multi-year) evaluation within a scenario, enabling differing levels of compliance or restriction between single years and multiple years.
II. POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS
The Forest Service is aware of several potential solutions for a vegetation model, including (a) Telsa / Vegetation Dynamic Development Tool (VDDT) - ESSA Technologies; (b) Multi-Resource Land Allocation Model (MRLAM) - John Sessions; (c) FPS - Forest Projection and Planning Systems; (d) OPTIONS - DR Systems; and (e) SNAP - Sale Network Analysis Program, originally developed by Dr. John Sessions at OSU. These are only potential solutions, and there may be other solutions. In addition to the needs to have a model that implements the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy outlined above under the statement Of need the following additional considerations are important: (1) habitat indexes (the model should allow customization via prescription development, treatment responses and timing -- future use of Hanley’s FRESH model should easily be incorporated); (2) modeling disturbance (the model should be able to insert disturbance events spatially via GIS layers with potential to be incorporated into software); (3) growth model (while many models can grow trees, the model sought here should to be configurable to use the Forest Service growth and yield model); (4) manipulating individual stand treatments thru time over different rotation lengths; (e) any models may allow individual stand manipulating through database but there is a need to allow this through management regimes, via GIS-based constraints or target rules developed by Forest Service); Other considerations such as software cost, fitting the analytical needs of the EIS, and number of polygons (the model should have enough capacity and potential expansion of data sets to allow for evaluations of small settings and even across the Tongass are also important.
III. INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES
Potential providers of a vegetation modeling solution to meet the needs of the Tongass National Forest (including those potential sources listed in II. above) are invited to identify themselves by submitting brief white papers to help us understand such matters as (a) what capabilities exist in the marketplace; (b) whether existing models meet our needs already or could be easily modified to meet our needs; (c) the buying and selling practices of firms engaged in providing and supporting these models and institutions using the models; (d) the practicability of and potential approaches to testing or demonstrating potential solutions as an early step in a future Forest Service acquisition; (e) the practicability of free short-term licenses for our use as potential customers investigating a product; (f) thoughts on how the Forest Service might evaluate proposals to identify the best solution; and (g) ideas and thoughts regarding the costs the Forest Service might expect to pay. The information shared in these white papers will be used by the Forest Service to determine how we might proceed with an acquisition strategy. This is not a solicitation for prices and products to be purchased in the immediate future; rather, this is market research to help us determine how we might proceed with acquiring a vegetation model in the near future. White papers should be delivered by November 10, 2008, with one copy to Richard Abt, Tongass National Forest, 204 Siginaka Way, Sitka AK 99835-7511, and the second copy to Steve Patton, Tongass National Forest, 648 Mission Street, Ketchikan AK 99901-6534.

<DESC>This description is being provided to determine possible sources for this requirement and to request suggestions as to what further information the requirement should contain.  Any recommended improvements to the requirements that would better enable offerors to respond with as few points of clarification as possible would be welcome.  Additionally, recommendations regarding the required period of time to adequately respond to this potential acquisition are requested.


REQUIREMENT

1. PURPOSE.

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain a landscape level feasibility study and proposed action to implement young-growth fish and wildlife habitat improvement treatments, and assess the availability of wood products (pole, sawlog and biomass), within the identified Prince of Wales Island project area.  

2. SCOPE.

The contractor will develop a proposed action based on the results of a feasibility study delineating treatment options for appropriate young-growth stands in the project area, implementation costs of these treatments, cost recovery of young growth products derived from treatment byproducts, impacts to habitat condition, and potential wood products and related values now and in the future.  The contractor’s efforts will include: 

1.	Use the Forest Plan to identify applicable standards and guidelines within the landscape zones identified for treatment. Define the existing condition. Use the GMU 2 deer document to understand the need for treatment in young-growth stands. Identify key areas (zones) for wildlife habitat (ie corridors) and riparian areas within the stands to be treated. Define treatment objectives for each zone. 
2.	Identify data gaps in the stand level information and conduct field reconnaissance adequate to accomplish the following steps.
3.	Develop at least 3 treatment options for each young-growth stand or sub-stand. (3 treatments and 1 no-treatment). Treatments should be timed to meet differing objectives (for example, habitat improvement now versus 10 years from now and byproduct volume and value now versus 10 years from now). Treatment options should vary based on management objectives for each landscape zone. 
4.	Compare treatment options using criteria similar to that provided in the example comparison matrix in Appendix A of this document. Provide stand level treatment options and comparison matrix in a feasibility study report.  
5.	In concert with the Forest Service use the feasibility study results to identify a proposed action and associated GIS layer.  


3. BACKGROUND

Timber harvest by even-aged management through clear cutting has been the dominant timber management regime on the Tongass National Forest since the 1950s.  Fifty percent of this harvest occurred during the 1960s and 1970s.  Many of these harvested areas are in a stem-excluded, even-aged condition, with little structural or understory vegetation diversity.  Numerous stands occur in riparian areas, at low elevations and on productive soils that can support high value habitat for wildlife. These conditions have resulted in reduced cover and forage for various wildlife species, especially deer, and changes to riparian habitats.   
Thinning is an intermediate silvicultural treatment used to manage young growth stands to achieve a variety of objectives, including accelerated tree growth, development of mature forest structure, and increased understory plant diversity.  Reducing the stand density of trees encourages better growing conditions by increasing light and reducing competition for growing space and nutrients within the stand.  This benefits wildlife by diversifying the structure and increasing the understory vegetation. 
Thinning can be achieved through pre-commercial or commercial treatments. Though the majority of this young-growth will not reach culmination of mean annual increment  for approximately 45-55 years, opportunities for commercial thinning, particularly for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement and development of new product markets might be encouraged.  At present, the greatest concern with potential commercial harvest treatments of young-growth is the economics of the anticipated projects. In current markets, it is expected that intermediate treatments in young-growth stands may be marginally economical, if not completely infeasible. In the interim, the Forest Service may need to do much of this work through service contracts or stewardship where we pay for the treatment offsetting the cost with product or we trade goods for services.  
In 2007, the Tongass National Forest developed a strategy for managing young growth forests in the Prince of Wales Game Management Unit (GMU2) to enhance wildlife habitat.. This strategy targeted areas that provide the greatest benefit to deer by increasing the supply of habitat in areas intensively used for hunting.  It addresses the endorsement by the Southeast Alaska Regional Advisory Council to manage young growth forests for the benefit of wildlife. The GMU2 report outlines priority 13 Wildlife Analysis Areas (WAA); the proposed study area for this project lies completely within those prioritized WAAs.
The Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (2008) (Forest Plan), the Tongass Young Growth Strategy (2008), and the Tongass Strategic Plan (2008) all direct, guide, and encourage the implementation of integrated management activities in young growth stands.  In February 2009, the Tongass Leadership Team approved a project proposal to initiate a young growth vegetation management project to enhance or restore fish and wildlife habitat within stem excluded stands and to assess the availability of by-products as a result of these treatments.  

Interest in young growth-derived forest products is growing.  Therefore it becomes imperative to evaluate tradeoffs and logistics associated with silvicultural treatments under consideration, particularly given different land use designation (LUD) areas on the Forest and the respective direction for those different LUDs.  Considerations include timing of treatments and tradeoffs between productivity and habitat gains now vs. later; costs for implementing treatments; appropriate logging systems; and potential products for given treatments and treatment areas.  A feasibility study is needed to examine these questions and tradeoffs in a quantified way such that the Forest can plan for, and act upon, young growth management decisions.

This contract calls for a feasibility study to evaluate one, two, or three project areas on POW Island for habitat treatment options with an emphasis on potential products from these treatments, and a proposed action for the project derived from the results of the study.  The feasibility study will aid in identifying fish and wildlife habitat improvement projects that may or may not generate by-products that may or may not be marketable. Depending on the outcome of that feasibility study and budgetary constraints, the Forest may or may not pursue environmental analysis of the thinning treatments examined in the study.

5. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES 

5.1 General.

Prepare a landscape level feasibility study and develop a proposed action for implementing young-growth intermediate treatments to enhance or restore wildlife and fish habitat. Include analysis of costs associated with by-product removal and consideration of potential markets.  Follow direction in the 2008 Tongass Land Management Plan and guidance in the 2008 Tongass Young-Growth Management Strategy for achieving multiple resource objectives related to habitat maintenance and restoration and timber stand improvement.
 
i)	Determine landscape level wildlife and fish habitat needs and priorities based on site specific desired condition.  
ii)	Evaluate silvicultural treatment options, tradeoffs between those options, and costs and benefits of those options on young-growth stands 30 years old and older in the project area.  
iii)	Prioritize and schedule treatments based on the size classes described in the Young Growth Strategy and silvicultural prescription decision tree included in the electronic project library. 
iv)	Work in cooperation with the Forest Service to develop a proposed action based on the outcomes of (ii) and (iii).

Direction for young-growth management comes from the Tongass Strategic Plan with emphasis on An Integrated Approach to Restoration and Enhancement.  The emphasis for a need for treatment at this time is derived from the GMU2 Management Strategy.  Prioritization of stand treatments will follow the Tongass Young-growth Strategy and the associated decision tree.  

The Forest will provide relevant environmental analyses, strategy documents, GIS and database access, and manual and handbook documents as necessary.

5.2 Task 1: Review Management Direction and Identify Key Landscape Zones and Resource Objectives for those Zones
5.2.1Overview
The contractor will review management direction, identify important landscape zones, and describe the existing condition, desired conditions and objectives for each zone in the assessment area. GIS support from Forest Service will likely be needed to accomplish this task. 
5.2.2 Strategy
Reviewing Management Direction: Identify Land Use Designations (LUDs) within the assessment area and review the Desired Condition (DC) for those LUDs as specified by the Forest Plan. Consider how the DC may apply to the area. As information about the current conditions is evaluated, consider what could be done to move the area toward a desired condition. 
Define the Existing Condition:  Identify existing key landscape zones. These are areas that reflect how key portions of the landscape function or areas having specific social or economic value. Wildlife and riparian management areas, landscape and elevational connectivity routes for wildlife, high value deer winter range, quality forage areas, snow intercept zones, visually seen areas, high public use areas, higher risk watersheds, and riparian management areas etc., should be identified at this stage. The intent of this step is to identify zones that can be mapped within the project area that may carry slightly different resource objectives, and those objectives may influence treatment options.  This component is intended to further synthesize Forest Plan direction by identifying applicable standards and guidelines and completing a landscape level watershed analysis. 
Roles and Responsibilities
The contractor will review management direction, identify important landscape zones, and describe the existing condition, desired conditions and objectives for each zone in the assessment area. GIS support from Forest Service will likely be needed to accomplish this task. 
5.2.3 Output(s)
i)	Information to be used in the description of current conditions within the assessment area and development of potential projects that will move the area toward a specified desired condition.
ii)	An existing condition statement for each landscape zone.
iii)	Desired condition statement for each zone.
iv)	Resource objective(s) for each zone. 
5.3 Task 2: Synthesize Existing Information and Identify and Fill Data Gaps  
5.3.1 Overview
The purpose of this task is to identify, review and synthesize information. Identify gaps in the stand level data and collect enough field data to accomplish the required tasks. 
5.3.2 Strategy
i)	GIS data, INFRA data, existing stand exam data and a variety of documents (e.g., NEPA analyses, roads analysis reports, etc.) will be valuable information sources. Also, consider approaching stakeholders for additional information about the area (e.g., private land-owners, other governmental entities, research organizations, etc.). 
ii)	Make note of gaps in the data to both qualify the analysis and to describe potential future investment opportunities. 
iii)	Fill data-gaps as necessary and possible.
iv)	Attempt to keep the description of current conditions focused by limiting the description to information that relates to the key questions or identified landscape zones. 
v)	Include a description of previous activity in the area as well as a description of the forces of change that can result in a summary to be used in subsequent NEPA analyses (e.g. existing condition description as well as past activities). 
vi)	Where inadequate data exists, conduct focused field reviews to collect data necessary to develop treatment options and compare costs of treatments and volume and value of any possible byproduct removal.
vii)	To identify markets consider interviewing sawmillers and loggers currently harvesting young-growth on Prince of Wales Island. 
Roles and Responsibilities
Contractor will identify, review, collect where lacking, and synthesize necessary information. 
5.3.3 Output(s)
An adequate data set to develop treatment options and compare treatment costs, habitat benefits, and volume and value of byproduct. 
5.4 Task 3: Develop Potential Treatment Options
5.4.1 Overview
The purpose of this task is to use the objectives by landscape zone identified in step 1 to develop potential treatment options that would address the need for change and move the area toward the desired conditions. Because project funding is contingent upon budgetary considerations, costs of treatment options will be a strong consideration in future decision-making. Work through this process as an interdisciplinary team to facilitate development of an integrated treatment plan.
5.4.2 Strategy
Consider the desired condition and objectives for the landscape zone being considered (based on an understanding of how that particular zone ought to function). Consider benefits and costs (effects on wood product quality and quantity, habitat values, and economics) of treating the stand now versus the future (up to 20 years from now). Consider changing stand boundaries where it makes sense to display different treatment options based on different resource objectives or stand conditions, or the feasibility of removing by-product from part of a stand and not from the remainder of the stand.  
Identify at least three treatment options that will address the need for change and move the area toward the desired condition. Below are some tips for describing potential treatment options for each stand: 
i)	Make explicit in the description of potential projects the need for change that has been identified and how the project is intended to address that need (i.e., provide a rationale for the project). 
ii)	Explain how the treatment would address objectives identified in Task 1. 
iii)	Attempt to develop integrated treatment options that accomplish more than one resource objective or differing resource objectives. Describe them as such in the assessment. 
iv)	Identify any information needs that would need to be fulfilled before moving forward with a given project.
v)	 Develop at least three treatment options for each young-growth stand or sub-stand and address and no-treatment option. Treatments should be timed to meet differing. Treatment options should vary based on management objectives for each landscape zone. 
Roles and Responsibilities
The contractor should work through this process as an interdisciplinary team to facilitate development of an integrated treatment plan.
5.4.3 Output(s)
A list of potential treatment options by stand and landscape zone that meet resource objectives for habitat and stand improvement and where it makes sense generate a by-product.
5.5 Task 4: Analysis Comparing Treatment Options and Final Study Report
5.5.1 Overview
The goal of this task is to determine the costs and benefits of the treatment options.  The Forest is specifically interested in and estimate of the treatment costs, the relative improvement of wildlife and fish habitat, and the volume and value of any wood byproducts generated. The analysis of treatment options will be the framework from which a proposed action for the project is developed. Work through this process as an interdisciplinary team to facilitate development of an integrated final study report.
5.5.2 Strategy
The Contractor shall compare treatment options using the five criteria outlined below. The analysis must provide a means of comparing and projecting silvicultural treatments and spatially displaying those treatments. The rationale for landscape zoning, treatment options and the comparison of treatment options must be included in the final study report.  Sources of data and data gaps must be clearly articulated in the final study report.   The analysis will consider the following components:

i)	How various treatment methods meet resource objectives, including:
•	An increase or maintenance strategy for understory species diversity for food, cover, and insect, bird and mammal diversity
•	An increase or maintenance strategy for forage production
•	The creation of structurally diverse stands
•	Analysis of the appropriate use of intermediate treatments in young growth stands to address current and future habitat needs
•	An understanding of scheduling treatments to balance size class distributions
•	An understanding of the improvement of the growth and productivity in treated stands

ii)	Whether and which treatment methods would generate byproducts that could be processed into a marketable product, and what those products might be.  

iii)	Costs of various treatment methods, the harvest systems necessary to implement the treatments, and the transportation network required to access the sites.

iv)	Spatial, value, and timing changes to existing or predicted stand resources resulting from the implementation of various treatments, including:
•	Habitat conditions
•	CMAI
•	Estimated commercial harvest timing and output (referencing growth and yield curves for different treatments)

v)	Benefits and costs of:
•	Projected benefits to fish and wildlife habitat vs timber production over time
•	Projected benefits to the treated stand
•	Estimated harvest options including costs
•	Estimated needs and costs of transportation system options.
•	Estimated value of different products made available through management activities
•	Estimated infrastructure needed to process the products
•	Capital investment requirements
Roles and Responsibilities
The contractor should work through this process as as an interdisciplinary team to facilitate development of an integrated final study report.
5.5.3 Output(s)
Prepared feasibility study that is consistent with, and tiered to, the 2008 Tongass National Forest Land Management Plan and Tongass Young Growth Strategy (2008) as they relate to improving fish and wildlife habitat.  The analysis will include, for each treatment:

i)	The implementation costs for government.
ii)	The type and volume of wood products, either today and/or in the future, and if in the future, when.
iii)	Relatively rank the treatments for habitat value of each stand, either today and/or in the future, and if in the future, when.
iv)	The harvest systems necessary to implement treatments, based on the forest-wide Logging System Transportation Analysis, the transportation network needed to access the sites, and the possible by-products and their values.  

A matrix, found in Appendix A, should summarize the contractor’s findings.  The matrix provided may serve as a starting point and outlines the minimum amount of information the Tongass requires for this task.
5.6 Task 5: Development of Proposed Action
5.6.1 Overview
Participate as full interdisciplinary team (IDT) members in developing a proposed action with the Forest Service IDT. Prepare a proposal in the form of a Proposed Action that considers findings from the feasibility study to recommend an action to meet the specific purpose and need.  An overview presentation will be provided to the Forest Service decision maker and IDT summarizing the feasibility study findings, beginning with landscape zones and ending with examples of treatment options for zones and stands.  GIS data bases will be prepared to describe treatment options. 
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Forest Service to describe the Proposed Action early in the planning process. The Proposed Action for the young-growth management project is one possible alternative for treating young-growth that enhances fish and wildlife habitat in the Project Area in a cost effective manner and is a focus of the scoping process that moves the Forest into NEPA.  It describes specific activities planned for the project area and provides the basis for the public’s opportunity to provide pertinent comments.  The Proposed Action is developed, based on the results of the field investigations and preliminary issues identified from past projects and meet the purpose and need for the project.  Through the collaborative planning process, other action alternatives will be developed that address public and other agency comments. 
Not all of the possible activities will have the same urgency or the same likelihood for funding based on cost or feasibility.  The contractor will work with the Forest Service to evaluate the list of possible activities outlined in the feasibility study (Task 4) and choose which ones to move forward based on perception of need, unit priorities, funding, personnel, partnership potential, politics etc.  

5.6.2 Strategy
The contractor will work with the Forest Service to develop a proposed action based on the results of the feasibility study.  The proposed action will delineate treatment options for appropriate stands in the project area which move the project area towards the desired condition and includes implementation costs of these treatments.  A reasonable proposed action is one that achieves, in larger part, the defined purpose and need while not violating any minimum environmental standards.  Information about a proposed action is a mixture of potential actions and outputs.  
The proposed action would treat young growth using timber harvest and/or precommercial thinning of 30 and older year old young growth stands.  The proposed action, if implemented would achieve multiple benefits and management objectives based on the Forest Plan in the most cost effective manner.  
•	Define the need for change:  What is the gap between desired and existing values.  
•	Identify Possible Activities: What logical group of activities can move forward as a Proposed Action that addresses the need for change?
•	Summarize the proposed action using a matrix, including maps.  
The FS anticipates 3 days of meetings beginning with a presentation by the contractor summarizing the study findings and offering recommendations for the integrated group to consider.  Following the presentation specific areas will be reviewed and treatment options chosen for each landscape zone or stand. 
Roles and Responsibilities
The contractor will provide an overview presentation to the forest service decision maker and IDT summarizing the feasibility study findings, beginning with landscape zones and ending with examples of treatment options for zones and stands, 
The contractor will then participate as full IDT members in developing a proposed action with the Forest Service IDT. 
The contractor will take notes and create a GIS data base treatment option by stands included in the proposed action.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is seeking to identify sources capable of conducting a study to determine possible causes ofpremature failure in concrete ties along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC).
In the last several years, Amtrak's inspections have detected an unexpectedly high number of concrete ties on the NEC which either have failed or are showing initial signs of failure or distress, long before reaching their design service life.  Indications are that nearly all of these were part of a large installation of 1.3 million ties done in the 1990's.  With major concrete tie installations on the NEC dating from the late 1970's, these failing ties are neither the oldest nor the newest on the NEC.
This study, which is being conducted as part of the Volpe Center's support to the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) oversight of Amtrak's operations, is aimed at identifying any manufacturing, design, or maintenance practices, or other specifications which might warrant change to help insure that all concrete ties installed on the NEC in the future will serve for their expected design life.  This study will supplement Amtrak's own investigations and is intended to provide an independent evaluation of Amtrak's findings.
Interested sources must submit a capabilities package demonstrating their past and current experience with work of this nature.  Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of your company to provide the described services.  All Offeror capability information shall include: Contract number; Customer (DOD agency, other Government agency, private industry); for government contracts the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers, otherwise for private industry contracts point of contact (POC); contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services.  All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than eight (8) pages.  Font size should be between 11-12 with page size set at 8 X 11, doubled spaced in either MSWord (2007 or earlier version) or PDF.  Each response must reference the sources sought title.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  In accordance with the NAICS provided, all Offerors must state whether they are a large or small business.  Offerors are requested to provide their DUNS and CCR numbers.  Interested parties must respond to this announcement electronically (via email) within 15 days of publication.  Mailed, telephonic, and faxed requests will not be honored.  All responses must be sent to the attention of Michael Leary, electronically via email.  Please email all responses to: Michael.J.Leary@dot.gov.

<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Group, SMC/MCWG, to solicit information from industry that will provide a capability in 2Q/3Q FY2010 that will replace the Camp Parks Communications Annex (CPCA) located in Dublin, CA. This site is a calibrated test site that MCWG has been using for the last several decades for Defense Satellite Communications Systems (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS). Information obtained as a result of this posting may be used for the development of a replacement site for Camp Parks. Currently, all initial in-orbit and post anomaly resolution support of the Wideband constellation is provided by the CPCA. Due to continuous availability of limited Operations and Maintenance funds and a limited customer base of CPCA, SMC may decide to close the facility.</p>

Our strategy is to conduct a sole source, firm fixed price acquisition to be awarded to PI Group for requirements and technical guidance as related to Engine Fuel Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Forensic Sciences; revision of NIST IR 6988; and meeting ISO/IEC DIS 17043 for proficiency testing.  The selection of PI Group is based on the company’s specific unique qualifications based on their in-depth knowledge and hands-on implementation skills in Laboratory Accreditation.  For another company to perform the required research and development would entail extensive review and mastery of our existing tools, standards, test methods, and procedures.   Based on these observations, PI Group is the only qualified, most cost effective, company to assist NIST in this research and development effort.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider other responses received by the deadline.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This Notice Is Provided For Informational Purposes Only. 

This opportunity is available to contractors under Federal Supply Schedule 56 (Buildings And Building Materials/Industrial Services And Supplies) SIN 206 3 (Alternative and Renewable Energy Solutions, including Solar Energy Systems and Solar Lighting, Fuel Cells, Wind Power). This is not a notice for solicitation or offers.

The purpose of this acquisition is to replace the existing solar roof system and roof membrane at the Senator Paul Simon Federal Building in Carbondale, Illinois, with an amorphous silicone BIPV system to the new 60 mil. base membrane on all portions of the roof . These sloped roof areas currently utilize the antiquated hydronic solar system that was designed in the 1970’s. The slope and orientation of the roof is conducive to solar collection. The existing solar system will be removed as part of this scope, as well as the EPDM roof membrane.

GSA is requiring that the system generate approximately 350 kW – 400 kW of onsite electrical generation; a data acquisition system, with continuous web based photo and file viewing of system output, emission reductions and weather information in real time; multiple inverters, isolation transformers and all interconnect requirements of the local Utility, Ameren UE Gas and Electric Company.  

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted via e-mail to Justin Costello at justin.costello@gsa.gov.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to add the installation of four (4) sets of playground equipment within four (4) different recreation areas.  The playground equipment is being purchased by a separate competitively awarded contract.  The work will include removing some outdated equipment and installing all of the new equipment.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all five of these recreation areas.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued. The solicitation number is 9TC1029 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33 and DFARS change notice 20090715. This purchase is restricted to 100% Small Business concern. The NAICS code is 334119 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This is requirement is for purchase of a Virtual Battle Space 2(VBS2) Software/Hardware. Please state discount terms and note your warranty information. This is a brand name or equal requirement.
<p>The contractor shall provide the following items:</p>
<p>ITEM 0001: Qty: 30 EA, VBS2 Licensing. <br />Powerful suite of administrator tools. The VBS2 terrain editor allows an administrator to rapidly develop terrain from DTED, VMAP and satellite or aerial photography. Bohemia Interactive's proprietary modeling tool Oxygen allows new 3D models to be developed or imported from 3D Studio Max. VBS2 content may also be encrypted for additional security. <br />Wide range of engine improvements. Many aspects of the simulation engine have been rewritten over the past three years to enhance performance and reliability.<br />ITEM 0002: Qty: 30 EA, VBS Virtual Tool Kits (VTK). The Virtual Tool Kit (VTK) comprises a suite of editors that will compliment the VBS2 product. In addition to the standard model and terrain editors, the VTK includes a Configuration Editor (allows simulation characteristics to be quickly and easily modified in a graphical interface), a Weapons Editor (allows the user to create new weapons based on existing ones in-game, and create new unit types), improvements to our terrain editor to allow import of digitized 2D maps, and also a range of improvements to the VBS2 Real Time Mission Editor to allow AI tasks and behaviors to be more easily defined. <br />ITEM 0003: Qty: 30 EA, Gaming Headsets<br />ITEM 0004: Qty: 5 EA, Racing Steering Wheel<br />ITEM 0005: Qty: 1 EA, Gaming Server. "Real Virtuality 2" 3D engine. The VBS2 game engine has been entirely developed by Bohemia Interactive, and is capable of rendering large terrain areas (up to 100km x 100km) with an impressive level of detail. The engine uses advanced software technology to populate the terrain with hundreds of thousands of objects such as buildings and vegetation. Diurnal rotation of the earth (Day/Night), accurate sun angles for latitude and date of the year, time-lapse weather patterns, and celestial objects are all accurately modeled. <br />High Level Architecture (HLA) and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Compliant. VBS2 is capable of federating with other HLA/DIS compliant sims. <br />Simulates any weapon platform. VBS2 is the perfect combined arms training solution. Participants operate as virtual entities that may use personal weapons, drive vehicles, operate weapons stations, fly aircraft and even board and pilot ships. Any weapon platform or sensor, from UAVs and ground surveillance radar through to artillery can be modeled to varying degrees of fidelity in the flexible VBS2 game engine. <br />Comprehensive scenario editors. VBS2 ships with the easy to use (yet powerful) VBS1 mission editor, and also a second entirely new 'real time scenario editor' that provides both instructor interface and command and control functions. Using the real time editor an administrator may copy and paste entire teams of units, place IEDs, respawn units, save the scenario to disk at any point during play and even place and move buildings. In command mode the editor allows a commander to assign tasks to subordinate teams and transmit marker overlays. <br />Agent AI. VBS2 employs flexible agent AI for more realistic behavior. Military doctrine is modeled through tasks which are developed in the VBS2 Task Editor. Unlike VBS1, teams of agents may be any size and structure (squads, platoons, companies etc).</p>
<p>ITEM 0006: Qty: 2 EA, External Multi-Display Units. Networkable (up to 100 players). Designed to train a Combat Team minus (infantry, armor, air and artillery support), VBS2 has inherent multi-user capability. The product can be operated in either a standalone mode using artificially intelligent opposing forces, or distributed across a LAN or Internet. After-action review (AAR) capability is included. Example applications of VBS2 include:</p>
<p>Out of the box:<br />&bull; Mission rehearsal and/or AO familiarization<br />&bull; Tactical training, up to the Combat Team level<br />&bull; Combined Arms or Joint Training<br />&bull; Convoy Training (incl integration of virtual reality)<br />&bull; Analysis of options (decision support)<br />&bull; Fire support / forward air controller training<br />&bull; Complimentary virtual environment for live and constructive simulation or crew procedural trainers<br />&bull; Navigation<br />&bull; Mission simulation (eg aviation elements practicing Landing Zone procedures)<br />&bull; Vehicle checkpoints and area control<br />&bull; Helicopter loadmaster training (requires Loadmaster Virtual Reality Simulators (LVRS)</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-09-1056133 and is being issued as a "Brand Name or Equal To" Request for Quotation (RFQ).  

(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35.  

(iv) The NAICS code is 541511 and the small business size standard is $25M.  The Government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for a base plus four option years and reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.  

(v) & (vi):  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)  Center for Food and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is seeking Advanced Signal Detection Software that can detect potential food or cosmetic safety signals in CFSAN's Adverse Event Reporting System database (CAERs) and Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of the Advance Signal Detection Software.  Please see the attached Statement of Work for more detail on this requirement.

(viii)   The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors –Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

1)Technical Understanding and Approach. The proposed content will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in part V of the SOW.  Contractors shall furnish as part of their quotation all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether their service meets the technical requirements. The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement. 
2) Past Performance: Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed with other federal agencies during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offer or has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services. This is a matter of judgment. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's past performance record. Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance. Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.

3) Small Business Subcontracting Plan: (Applies to large businesses only in the event the total proposed cost inclusive of all options exceeds $550,000) Offerors will be required to demonstrate the extent of their small business participation through the submission of a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with the criteria set forth in FAR 19.704 “Subcontracting Plan Requirements” and 52.219-9 “Small Business Subcontracting Plans".  The Offeror shall use the template in Attachment 3 to develop its small business subcontracting plan.   

4) Price. The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two option period. Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

 (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendor’s online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. 

(xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUN 2009), applies to this acquisition as well as the following clauses cited therein:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611710 for full and open competition.  

1.	TITLE – 

Development of Information Management Processes, Balanced Scorecard and Performance Metrics for Public-Private Partnerships at FDA

2. BACKGROUND –

FDA’s mission to protect and promote public health is as grand as its jurisdiction.   To maintain the trust and the confidence of the public we serve—extending beyond regulatory roles—FDA must rise to the challenges of bridging scientific gaps—and be seen as an engaged partner rather than a barrier.  As the development path for all products under FDA’s watch has become increasingly inefficient and costly, non-traditional models of collaboration that leverage expertise and resources must be developed to tackle scientific problems and inform FDA’s regulatory decisions.  The current climate of scarce resources and high demands for cheaper, safer and more effective products creates an imperative need for strategic partnerships with FDA’s stakeholders.   Therefore, FDA will need to fortify and expand the scope of existing partnerships, develop novel business models and become more pro-active if it is to deliver on its responsibilities as leaders under the Department of Health and Human Services—thereby reinforcing FDA’s status as the gold standard regulatory authority.  FDA must pioneer new paths as it anticipates innovative technologies and new challenges.  

The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Program Team within the Office of the Commissioner (OC), FDA is constituted operating under the Congressional mandate: Subchapter E of chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.) and amended by: Legislation Authorizing public-private partnerships (PPP) at FDA under FDAAA, SEC. 566.  This PPP Program is dedicated to the mission of FDA through the creation and maintenance of partnerships among FDA and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, academia, regulated industry, patient advocacy groups, professional organizations, and other similar interested stakeholders.  The PPP Program Team consists of highly trained scientific and administrative staff, located within the Immediate Office of the Commissioner, FDA and directed by the Senior Scientific Advisor, under the leadership of the Deputy Commissioner and Chief Scientist.

PPPs facilitate collaboration among FDA and stakeholders—working along aligned missions and under mutually beneficial goals—to address important cross-cutting scientific and public health needs, in a pre-competitive atmosphere.  Outcomes from these collaborations are transferred to the public domain for the benefit of all stakeholders.  As transparency and operational effectiveness are key elements of all activities at Federal agencies, this FDA PPP program incorporates inclusivity and critical public health needs.   Each area of focus must have performance metrics and meaningful outcomes that demonstrate a return on the taxpayer’s investments. PPPs represent a different mechanism of leveraging both public and private expertise and resources to bridge scientific gaps and address public health issues.  As such, many of the traditional performance metrics and outcome measures cannot fully quantify the results of creative programs—many of which are unprecedented in scope, timelines and deliverables—and new methods to capture information and measure progress are needed.  

Therefore, FDA seeks, under its Office of Scientific and Medical programs and its public health mission, to grant an award to for the development of performance metrics, a balanced scorecard and information management processes to sustain these PPPs and to facilitate meaningful reporting on the outcomes thereof.

 3. OBJECTIVES – State the objective(s) or desired results.  

PPP mechanisms create an environment where multiple stakeholders can assemble and pool resources and expertise in order to solve a common problem.  FDA has created, implemented and currently managing a number of PPPs.

1.	Develop rigorous processes for the quantification of the value of PPPs to the FDA, partners, and the public;
2.	Provide expert recommendations for the methods and tools to support the creation, implementation, monitoring, and optimization of PPPs;
3.	Develop an information management system in facilitate easy storage, annotation, and retrieval of information associated with PPPs; and
4.	Perform and publish detailed analysis and document selected PPPs )a case study approach) including their core purpose and mission, entities involved, perceptions of a broad rang of stakeholders, and assessment of the value generated by the PPPs.

4. SPECIFIC TASKS –

The following tasks shall be performed by the contractor, with key input from FDA staff:
•	Develop and conduct surveys with partners and stakeholders for a selection of existing PPPs, compile data, and publish the case studies in peer-reviewed journals and/or on the FDA website;
•	Develop a system of metrics for qualitative and quantitative analysis and measurement of stakeholder contributions to these PPPs;
•	Develop a Balanced Scorecard to assess the value of projects/studies being conducted under PPPs; and

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Stage System for use in a Rotating Anode X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) System. ***

Background:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, has a requirement for a stage system capable of being automated through LabView (LV) for use in a rotating anode x-ray fluorescence system.

NIST has already provided capital for a rotating anode source to be repaired.  The source is capable of producing 300 times more x-rays than the conventional XRF system already in place.  The primary interest for this high powered beam is to produce an instrument capable of mapping the composition of an extremely large sample (nominally 200 mm x 200 mm or more) in 1/5th the time it takes on a conventional instrument.  In order to produce images, the system will require a large, 3 axis stage, which is capable of being programmed to produce a raster type scan, and a single axis stage capable of focusing the x-ray optic.  The stage must have a large travel distance, be capable of micro control, and have high system reproducibility. 

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

<DESC><p>HIV Vaccine Strategy -SOW
<p>A. Background Information</p>
<p>In order to enhance the efficacy of our current HIV vaccine strategies, we plan to incorporate an antibody-based HIV vaccine with three separate HIV vaccine strategies developed by the NCI Vaccine Branch to prevent HIV infection and transmission. Binding antibodies are reliably detected in most of the macaques vaccinated with many of our HIV vaccine strategies, whereas neutralizing antibodies are rarely, or even if detected, usually of a low titer and narrow in their breadth. It is generally believed that an effective HIV vaccine will have to elicit antibodies that react against highly conserved domains on the HIV envelope. Devico et al found that epitopes located in and around the coreceptor binding site of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120), which exhibit enhanced exposure after attachment to the CD4 receptor and comprise some of the most conserved and functionally important residues on the viral envelope, could elicit antibodies in vaccinated macaques and clear plasma viremia in contrast to unvaccinated control animals. Based on this conclusion, a collaborative program was established to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the three different HIV vaccine strategies developed by the NCI Vaccine Branch, each incorporating the antibody-based CD4 receptor-inducible epitope Full-Length Single Chain (FLSC) vaccine.</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>There are 3 projects that comprise this collaborative study all using some form of an AIDS vaccine candidate called full length single chain or FLSC. Project one involves a mucosal &amp; nanoparticle vaccine; Project two involves a DNA/protein vaccine using in vivo electroporation as DNA delivery methodology and Project three involves an adenovirus vector prime/envelope protein boost vaccine strategy.</p>
<p>Project one has three purposes for this study. The main one is to test the concept that a T-cell based mucosal vaccine combined with an antibody-based mucosal vaccine will generate better immunity to prevent HIV transmission and infection at the site of entry, or if the virus is transmitted, to slow the development of AIDS. If most of the virus inoculum is neutralized by secretory IgA, and thus the initial mucosal nidus of infection is small, it may be possible for mucosal memory CD8+ T cells to respond fast enough to eradicate this initial nidus before it replicates to levels necessary to spread to the lymph nodes and then the bloodstream. Thus, the goal is to nip the infection in the bud and prevent establishment of systemic infection. The second purpose of this study is to test a new technique for delivering the vaccine. Much of our vaccine strategies have involved intrarectal immunization, which we found to be one of the most effective routes for inducing mucosal immunity. To develop a way to accomplish the same goal via the oral route, one approach we are currently exploring is to deliver nanoparticles containing the vaccine encapsulated in microparticles that can pass through the stomach acid intact and release their nanoparticle contents at a pH characteristic of an appropriate level of the small or large intestine. The third purpose is to test either heterologous challenge or a therapeutic vaccine depending on the results of the preventative vaccine study. If most of the monkeys have been protected, we will re-challenge the monkey with SIVmac251 to examine whether the vaccine-induced protection is persistent long enough to protect against a heterologous challenge. If most of the monkeys turn out to be infected, then we will test our peptide-based therapeutic vaccine under ART.</p>
<p>Project two will examine the immunogenicity induced by DNA vaccine boosted by rhFLSC protein. The DNA vaccine is delivered by in vivo electroporation using a mixture of plasmids that contain rhFLSC DNA in addition to plasmids expressing gag, pol, nef, tat vif. The purpose of these experimental arms is to compare immunogenicity of DNA only vs DNA coinjected with protein, or the protein is given as boost. Using intramuscular vs intradermal delivery of DNA will allow to directly compare the quantity and quality of the induced immune responses. The following 4 arms will be tested: DNA vaccine is delivered intramuscularly (1), DNA is coinjected with env-CD4 protein (2), DNA is given a prime followed by protein boosts (3), DNA is coinjected intradermally with env-CD4 protein (4). This project will also examine the efficacy of the induced immune responses upon challenge by SHIV SF162P4.</p>
<p>Project three involves the induction of humoral, cellular and mucosal immunity, and protective efficacy by a replicating Ad-recombinant prime/FLSC boost strategy. This project will examine if (1) priming with a replicating Ad 5 host range mutant (Ad5hr)-HIV recombinant encoding the rhFLSC gene and boosting with rhFLSC protein will elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and potent protection;(2) priming with an Ad5hr-HIVBalgp160 recombinant will elicit broader antibody responses and better cellular immunity than priming with Ad5hr-HIVBalrhFLSC;(3) the prime boost approach will elicit a wide spectrum of immune responses, including envelope-specific cellular immunity in peripheral blood and mucosal sites, and systemic and mucosal antibodies with neutralizing and other functional activities; (4) the prime/boost approach will result in protection against a heterologous SHIVSF162P4 rectal challenge.</p>
<p>C. Overall Requirements</p>
<p>The Subcontractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities as needed to perform the work outlined below: <br />1) Provide a well-equipped and maintained animal facility for the maintenance of up to 106 non-human primates (Indian rhesus macaques). Animals will be initially held at biosafety level one (BSL-1) until containment at biosafety level two (BL-2) with biosafety level three (BL-3) practices are required due to experimental infection with biohazardous agents. <br />2) Put the animals through appropriate quarantine and testing.<br />3) Provide housing, veterinary care and routine health surveillance for all animals maintained under this Subcontract seven days a week as necessary. Provide veterinary care for all animals in accordance with (1)"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", DHHS (NIH 85-23, (2)"Animal Welfare (DHHS-TN 73-2); (3) NIH Manual "Responsibility for Care and Use of Animals", Issuance 4206 and 6000-3-4-58, and (4) Public Health Services Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. <br />4) Provide caging of the size and configuration to meet current USDA/APHIS standards and requirements for the housing of NHP's, including those animals requiring BL2/BL3 containment.<br />5) All manipulations will be performed as directed by the NCI Project Managers for the 3 specific projects. Blood samples will be collected according to a schedule provided by the NCI Project Managers for the 3 specific projects. Some samples will be analyzed by the Subcontractor for Complete Blood Count (CBC, including determination of CD4, CD8 cells, serum and chemistry) and the data will be sent to the project manager. Other blood samples will be either directly shipped to project manager or sent as isolated live-frozen PBMCs and plasma. Plasma viral load, antibody titers, drug treatment, vaccination, infection, any other necessary treatments, and necropsies will be performed as specified by the NCI Project Managers. <br />6) Provide and conduct clinical laboratory testing for analysis of animal materials (such as complete blood counts, parasite evaluations, and bacterial culture and serum chemistry tests) as required for appropriately monitoring the animals' health and treating any occurrences of disease.<br />7) Provide technical assistance and veterinary assistance as needed for performance of all procedures required by research protocols such as inoculation and bleeding of the animals, collection of saliva, vaginal lavage fluid, rectal secretions, bone marrow, bronchial alveolar lavage(BAL) and provide professional veterinary assistance for performance of all surgical procedures (such as intestinal resections, laparotomy for colonic wedge resection, vaginal, colonic and rectal pinch biopsies, lymph node biopsies, jejunal endoscopy) and complete post-mortem examinations.<br />8) Maintaining, and monitoring of an estimated total of 106 macaques until all 3 studies comprising this collaborative study are complete (estimated duration of 18 months). The work and effort obligated to meet the requirements of this SOW are subject to the needs of SAIC-F's client, SAIC-F's needs, the Subcontractor's performance, and the availability of funds for this project.<br />9) Infect animals with viruses or recombinant viruses as specified by the NCI Project Managers. Appropriate BL2/BL3 laboratory space must be available for preparation of inocula, filling of injection devices and other biohazardous sample handling.</p>
<p>10) Any additional information regarding possible pathologic changes in the animals must be reported immediately to the NCI Project Manager, and SAIC-F Contract Manager's Technical Representative (SAIC-F COTR). In case euthanasia of animal is necessary due to any health problems, necropsy will be performed on the animals by the Subcontractor according to protocols provided by the individual project managers. The necropsy report will be provided directly to the NCI Project Manager. Necropsy report will include pathologic tissue analysis as requested by the Project Manager. Tissue samples requested should be taken and sent to the Project Manager as specified, and may include tissue snap frozen on dry ice, fixed in formalin, and/or provided fresh and sterile in media. Tissues requested may include: right and left axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, liver without gall bladder, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, large bowel; mesenteric and colonic lymph nodes and spleen; rectal/vaginal/cervical tissue. If necessary this list may be modified and changes provided to the Subcontractor.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated for compliance with the minimum requirements below.  In this evaluation, minimum requirements will be evaluated on a “Go—No Go” basis.  (“Go—No Go” is synonymous with “Acceptable—Unacceptable”.)  Offerors that do not meet the minimum requirements will be deemed not acceptable for this Project and will not be considered further. Conformance to item ‘a’ will be evaluated prior to full evaluation of the SF330. Conformance to item ‘b’ will be evaluated after full evaluation of the SF330 at the determination of the short list.

a.	For the proposed 8(a) set-aside contracts, offeror must be registered as an 8(a) certified small business; this requirement does not apply to the proposed full and open contracts.

The offeror must identify in the SF330 Part II for the prime offeror or joint venture under item 5.b. Small Business Status that they are a certified 8(a) program participant. An offeror for the proposed 8(a) set-aside contracts not meeting this requirement will be deemed not acceptable for this Project and will not be considered further.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>A.1. Background</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aircraft Operations Center (NOAA AOC) owns/operates a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350ER: serial number FM21; FAA registration N68RF. As its primary mission, the aircraft supports the NOAA National Ocean Service Remote Sensing Division located in Silver Spring, MD. The AOC at MacDill AFB, FL manages the aircraft which is primarily operated throughout the United States including occasional trips to Alaska, Hawaii, and other U.S. territories.</p>
<p>NOAA N68RF shall require Phase 1 and Phase 2 inspections to be conducted during the initial manufacturer's production warranty. NOAA N68RF is equipped with Collins Pro-line 21 Avionics Package plus camera port &amp; cargo door modifications. The aircraft began NOAA service on May 15, 2009 and is expected to be fully mission capable by August 1, 2009.</p>
<p>A.2. PHASE 1 AND 2 INSPECTIONS (CLINs 0001 and 0002)</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities to comply with the manufacturer's Phase 1 and Phase 2 inspections as per Chapter 5 of the Manufacturer's Maintenance Manual and repair any additional aircraft discrepancies when it arrives at the contractor's facility. Because this aircraft is new, a manufacturer's warranty still exists. The contractor shall coordinate all warranty repairs with Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Specialized maintenance and repairs may be subcontracted; however, NOAA AOC reserves the right to approve or disapprove the subcontractor.</p>
<p>The Government shall be responsible for scheduling all work against this contract. Once the aircraft arrives at the contractor's facility, no work shall begin until the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) has given proper approval. Only the work that is requested by the Contracting Officer (CO) will be accomplished. Any additional work or discrepancies must have prior approval from the CO. As soon as possible, the contractor shall provide a list of discrepancies/inspection report, condition on all major components, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives requiring compliance, and any recommendations (if applicable) for maintenance that would prevent future failures.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and AOC required documentation to include but not be limited to approval for return to service. The contractor shall have direct access to the AOC maintenance tracking system and comply with all requirements of that system.</p>
<p>For planning purposes all hours-based inspection requirements should be estimated assuming the aircraft flies approximately 500-700 hours per year.</p>
<p>b) OVER AND ABOVE (CLIN 0003). The Contractor is responsible for documenting and reporting all discrepancies that are found during inspections that are not a part of a complete routine Hawker Beechcraft phase 1and 2 inspections. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced and is not included in a routine phase inspection is considered over and above. <br />The discrepancy report must include (as a minimum):<br />-Description of each discrepancy found;<br />-Number of person-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy;<br />-Hourly rate for personnel performing the work;<br />-Parts cost less the percentage discount, if any;<br />-Total dollar amount for each discrepancy; and<br />-Total dollar amount for the complete list of discrepancies.<br />The COR will be responsible for reviewing the list of discrepancies and making a recommendation to the Contracting Officer, to either accept or decline the Contractor's proposal. The Contractor shall not proceed with correcting any discrepancies without prior approval from the COR. Funds for these services will be specified at the time of award and included in contract line item number (CLIN) 0003. The dollar amount stated in the schedule for CLIN 0003 will represent an estimated total, not- to- exceed amount, to cover charges for over and above items. The Government will pay invoices for over and above items out of the funds allocated and authorized on CLIN 0003. This paragraph applies only to CLIN 0003. It is not possible prior to contract award to accurately estimate the extent and duration of work or to anticipate costs for CLIN 0003 with any reasonable degree of confidence. Therefore, time and materials provides for acquiring these services on the basis of direct labor hours and cost of materials. Direct labor hours are at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Cost of materials includes parts and appropriate material handling costs. The price to be paid for material shall be based on an established catalog or list price in effect when material or other product is furnished, less all applicable discounts to the Government. In no event shall the price exceed the contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for the same item in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>c) PARTS AND WARRANTY: The contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the aircraft. All items are to be provided by the contractor in new condition and shall be properly tagged in conformance with FAA regulations. Parts or components in an "as removed" status will not be installed on the aircraft. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an "Over and Above" item. Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Part Manufacturing Authority (PMA) parts will be acceptable at any time. The contractor will obtain instruction regarding the disposition of non-exchangeable items from the COR. Parts and material furnished during all inspections and repairs will be warranted to be free from defects and workmanship for a period of one year of service or 500 flight hours whichever occurs first, from the date of Government acceptance.</p>
<p>d) DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS: The aircraft will be flown to the contractor's facility by a Government flight crew. The COR or the flight crew will notify the Contractor as soon as the need for the Phase Inspections, and/or repair has been identified. Based on current projections, Phase 1will be due September 15, 2009 and Phase 2 by January 15, 2010. Phase inspections and all repairs should be conducted as expeditiously as possible so as to minimize aircraft out of service time. The aircraft should be returned to service within two weeks of induction into phase inspection/maintenance. If possible, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the contractor's attention. <br /><br />e) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain liability and hull insurance of not less than $10,000,000.00 to replace the aircraft being inspected or repaired in the event the property should be damaged or lost during inspection or repair. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective:<br />1.

This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-35. This solicitation is reserved for small businesses, NAICS 811420, Restoration and repair of antique furniture with a small business size standard of $7.0M. The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer represents the best value for the Government, price and other factors considered.
Background:  This project involves the conservation treatment of furniture in the museum collection of the McLoughlin House unit, Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.  The objects to be assessed and treated are currently on exhibit at the McLoughlin House: a sewing cabinet, a melodeon, and a lap-size writing desk.  Condition Survey Forms summarizing the objects and their needs as well as digital photographs are included with this Scope of Work (SOW). The work will consist of several stages to be completed primarily at the Contractor's laboratory. 
Stage 1:  The Contractor will pick up the objects at the McLoughlin House and take them to her or his laboratory.  The Contractor will prepare individual Object Examination Reports and Object Treatment Proposals per NPS Standards as described in the NPS Museum Handbook, Part I, Chapter 8, available on the web at http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html. When completed, these reports are to be sent to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for review and approval. 
Stage 2.  Following approval and revision (as needed) of the Object Treatment Proposals, the Contractor will proceed with treatment of the individual objects.  Object Treatment Reports and photo-documentation before, during and after treatment will be completed. 
Stage 3.  Once all objects have been treated, the Contractor will deliver the treated objects to the McLoughlin House.  All final deliverables including photo-documentation and Object Treatment Reports will be delivered to the COR at this time.
NOTE, photographs of the objects to be treated may be obtained by email, please contact the Contracting Officer at Barry_fetzer@nps.gov to obtain pictures. 
The Contractor will provide all needed labor, services, equipment, supplies, lodging, and transportation required to complete the project. The contractor shall be responsible for insuring the objects while they are in her or his custody. The Contractor will examine each object and prepare an individual Object Examination Report.  These reports will include a concise statement describing the objects' material composition and physical condition, indicating any damage.  The reports will identify the presence of components or conditions that may influence conservation treatment and which may aid in the evaluation of ongoing treatment.  Any analysis done to identify materials shall also be included in the examination reports. The Contractor will consult with the COR to determine the best approach to preservation and conservation treatment.  Using this information along with the completed Object Examination Reports, the Contractor will prepare written Proposals for Treatment for each object. Drawings or illustrations may be included to aid with the description of proposed treatment. Enough detail of methods and materials will be included in each Proposal for Treatment to support peer review by National Park Service (NPS) Conservators at conservation centers and laboratories. Object Examination Reports and Proposals for Treatment shall be submitted to the COR within thirty (30) working days of the Contractor's departure from the McLoughlin House with the objects. The COR will coordinate peer review of the treatment proposals by appropriate specialists.  Once the proposals have been accepted in writing, the Contractor will proceed with the treatments. The Contractor will photo-document each object before, during and after treatment.  An Object Treatment Report will be written for each object treated, including in the description all the techniques and exact materials used. Treated objects will be picked up from and returned to the COR at the McLoughlin House, 713 Center Street, Oregon City, Oregon.

The Peace Corps requires:

This is the scope of work to upgrade the audio system in Shriver auditorium.  
 
1.  The conference room is broken down into three sections (Shriver A, B, C).  Each room needs to be both independently wired for audio, as well as be tied into a single system (to be used when all three rooms are combined into one large room).
 
2.  The audio will be tied into the current AMX system that was recently installed.  This system is controlled by touch panels (one for each room), and will ultimately be able to give the end user the ability to independently run the audio from each room without the need for an audiovisual technician to be on hand.
 
3.  In order to accomplish this, the system will need to be programmed to digitally control the incoming audio signal – additionally, the room will need to be completely rewired to accommodate the placement of microphones and speakers.

General
 
1. All equipment shall be installed as to present no safety hazards to the public,
to operating personnel, to equipment or to other trades.
 
2. All equipment must be adequately ventilated when operating under worst-case
power dissipation.
 
3. Materials and equipment required for a complete system but not specified
herein as to manufacturer or quality shall be of high commercial standard and
quality.
 
Software
 
1. All software programs and their associated hardware components must be
fully installed, programmed and configured.
 
2. Before the system is deemed complete and ready for final acceptance all
software and hardware issues must be rectified.
 
3. All software programming must be performed by manufacturer trained and
authorized personnel.
 
4. All software programming shall meet manufacturer’s recommendations and
best industry practices. Expect that the manufacturer may be requested to review
their programming. At the discretion of the Systems Engineer, the Contractor
may be directed to modify their program to the manufacturer’s directions.
 
5. Deliver two complete copies of the software (source code) for all processors
and touch panels to the Client with the system manuals.
 
Wiring and Cable Termination
 
1. Take all necessary precautions to prevent electromagnetic and electrostatic
interference. Care should be taken during wiring and installation to prevent
damage to wire or equipment. Use best industry practices to ensure long-term
reliability.
 
2. All terminations of shielded twisted pair cables, regardless of location, shall
consist of a Teflon, PVC or neoprene sleeve covering the shield drain wire and
an overall heat shrink or elastic neoprene sleeve covering the point at which the
cable jacket and shield end. (This makes it very difficult to inadvertently ground a
shield and is an important aspect of audio system wiring.) At the termination the
unshielded leads shall be less than 50 mm in length but not so short as to
present undue stress of the soldered joint.
 
3. All wiring entering the racks shall have a service loop (slack), allowing future
rewiring. This slack wire shall be neatly harnessed into place.
 
4. All cable and cable bundles shall be neatly and logically routed and organized.
Bundles of varying signal level shall be spaced at least 10 cm apart and secured
to dedicated tie bars. Wiring in racks shall not be left unsupported.
 
5. Do not attach cables to the fire-sprinkler system, electrical distribution of any
system or any ancillary equipment or hardware. The cable system and support
hardware shall be installed so that operation of any valves, fire panels, access
doors, or control devices are not impeded.
 
6. Install all cables in continuous lengths from origin to destination. Splices are
unacceptable.
 
7. Audio and control terminations shall be made with rosin-core solder or an
approved mechanical connector. Crimp only with manufacturer's recommended
crimping tool having a controlled crimp cycle.
 
8. Mechanically connected XLR and phone plugs will not be allowed.
 
9. RF terminations shall be made with crimp connectors only (no screw-on
connectors)
 
10. As some audio signal cables may share a conduit with control cables (e.g.
Paging Mics), take appropriate precautions to prevent pops and clicks in the
system. Control circuits that require a reference shall not share audio shields as
their reference.
 
Audio Interconnection
 
1. All microphone and line level wiring outside of racks shall be balanced and
floating, unless otherwise indicated or required by the source or destination
devices.
 
2. All microphone and line level wiring to be balanced, except where specified
equipment has unbalanced terminations.
 
3. Unless otherwise noted, all microphone and line level connections to be via
XLR connectors, except as required by source or destination devices
 
Video Interconnection
 
1. All BNC type video connectors shall be of high quality with a crimp style strain
relief.
 
2. All other “line level” type video connectors shall be of high quality with the
opposing mating surfaces composed of similar metal types.
 
3. Ensure that all Video transmission paths are properly terminated with the
appropriate device.
 
Control and Data Interconnection
 
1. All data and control connectors shall be of high performance and quality.
 
2. All opposing mating surfaces shall be of similar metals.
 
3. All connections shall maintain telecommunication industry defined impedances
for that particular circuit type and connection.
 
4. Ensure that all Data and Digital transmission paths are properly terminated
with the appropriate device.

<DESC>Green Jobs
STATEMENT OF WORK
July 24, 2009

I.	INTRODUCTION  

The energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors (green jobs) are deemed to be emerging and high growth industries.   Early indicators reflect low participation of women in green training programs.  The purpose of this project is to increase the participation of women in training programs that teach the skills required in any of the seven energy efficiency and renewable energy industries defined in Section 171(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Workforce Investment Act, which include:
•	The energy-efficient building, construction, and retrofit industries;
•	The renewable electric power industry;
•	The energy efficient and advanced drive train vehicle industry;
•	The biofuels industry;
•	The deconstruction and materials use industries;
•	The energy efficiency assessment industry serving residential, commercial, or industrial sectors; and 
•	Manufacturers that produce sustainable products using environmentally sustainable processes and materials.

II.	BACKGROUND  

The Women’s Bureau (WB), one of the oldest agencies within the U. S. Department of Labor, was created by Congress on June 5, 1920.   The WB’s mission is to improve the status of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.  The WB, through its Strengthening the Family Initiatives – Better Jobs, Better Earnings, Better Living and Value-Added Partners – prepares women for tomorrow’s jobs and promotes an environment that is responsive to the demands and challenges of the 21st Century workforce.  Women in the labor force have grown from eight million in 1920 to almost 71 million in 2007.  By the Year 2012, women are projected to comprise 47 percent of the U. S. labor force.  While the current economic downturn has resulted in job losses primarily for men (80 percent as opposed to 20 percent women losing their jobs), in order for women to continue to contribute to the family income and provide for their children as single parents, additional efforts are needed to ensure that women are made aware of opportunities in the emerging and high growth industries.
The Women’s Bureau, Region 9, is soliciting a Contractor to work with the WB Regional office to increase the participation of women in an existing green job training program or expand a current training program for women to incorporate a green jobs component.  The goal for the project is to assist at least 20 women enter training leading to a certification or other industry-recognized skill that will lead to employment.  The targeted area for this project is:  Arizona, California, Nevada or Hawaii.

III.	SCOPE OF WORK  

Contractor requirements:
•	Must currently have at least one training program in an energy efficiency or renewable energy industry (as defined above) that leads to certification or a degree in that field, or
•	Must operate a training program that serves women and incorporates a certified skills training program in any of the seven energy efficiency and renewable energy industries as defined above in the Workforce Investment Act.
•	Must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov)

Under this project, Contractor will design an outreach,  recruitment, and retention support model that assists a minimum of 20 women enter training in one or more of their energy efficiency or renewable energy industry training programs that leads to a certification or industry-recognized skill leading to employment. 

Tasks and Deliverables  

1.	Schedule a meeting (telephone or face-to-face) with the COTR within two weeks of receiving the contract to discuss all details/questions regarding scheduling and the deliverables. 
2.	Provide the fully developed outreach, recruitment, retention and support plan in accordance with the Contractor’s proposal to WB Region 9.
3.	Identify the skill and industry in which participants will be trained.
4.	Using the methodologies outlined in the proposal, track and report the results of the outreach and recruitment methods to the WB on a monthly basis.  Reporting format will be provided by WB.
5.	Provide reports on a quarterly basis to the WB if there are any changes in the number of women enrolled in pertinent green jobs courses, course completions, job placements, best practices as identified and challenges encountered.  Reporting format will be provided by WB.
6.	Before training is completed, identify potential employers and assist participants with job search skills following completion of training.
7.	Provide a final report to the WB on the enrollment of women in green jobs training by August 15, 2010.  Reporting format will be provided by WB.

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is soliciting individuals with the right skill sets and availability to invest numerous hours a week to write final agency decisions (FADs) in accordance with EEOC regulations and USPS quality and timeliness standards.  Selected individuals will be home-based independent contractors, located throughout the United States, who will enter into Ordering Agreements with the USPS to provide FAD writing services in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.  Individual Task Orders assigning the writing of particular FADs may be issued under the Ordering Agreement in a "fee for service" arrangement.  There is no guarantee of work or the number of cases assigned.  A FAD writer is paid on a “per case” basis, generally $350, on successful completion of the case.   FAD writer performance will be evaluated by USPS NEEOISO management and depending on case complexity, FAD writers usually average from 8 to 10 cases per month.  

The attached document lists computer system/software, education and experience requirements for USPS EEO Final Agency Decision writers.  It also provides instructions to interested individuals on how and where to submit resumes and narratives that will be used to select the contract FAD writers.

The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Reserved<br />(h) Reserved<br />(i) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC><p>22 July 09 - The purpose of this modification is to add questions and answers.&nbsp; A CAD file has been added as well.</p>
<p>1. What size (in inches) are the columns? 3.13 inches</p>
<p>2. Do you have any shelving layouts or drawings other than the ones supplied? There are no drawings that is why the customer wants you to provide one in your solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Does this allow for walk-ways or will there need to be room left outside of these areas for walk-ways? yes this allows for walk-way</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Using AutoCAD, the drawing can viewed at a 1:1 scale by clicking the model space button on the lower left hand corner. Inside paper space the sheet will state Not to Scale so when the drawing is printed on various page sizes it won't be misinterpreted (i.e. 8.5x11, 11x17, etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;23 July 09 - The purpose of this modification is to clarify a few things and more questions and answers.</p>
<p>1. The additional wall units are not mandatory, but optional the bottom line is that you are able to provide the 1400 storage spaces.</p>
<p>2. There are two designated workspaces on the drawing as long as you leave one of the two spaces open, you will be able to utilize the space of the work area you are not leaving vacant.</p>
<p>3: Are you sure the columns are only 3.13 inches? This doesn't seem right. 13 Inches<br /><br />4: Should we go off the dimensions the CAD file provides or the one in the drawings, because they do not match at all. The measurements on the drawings are not exact they are approximate<br /><br />5: I see an option 1 work area and an option 2 work area. Are we supposed to provide a quote with two options? One that shows a system using the option 1 work area and another that shows a system using the option 2 work area? Because you can only have one or the other for the system to fit in the room. Or do you just want whichever option is the cheapest? <br />We need only need one quote, in that quote you must leave us an area to put a work area. The point of the options were to give you the vendor a choice of where your system will fit. We would prefer option 1, but if you can not get your system to work that way we will except option 2.</p>
<p>24 July 09 - The purpose of this modification is to add more questions and answers.</p>
<p>A) In the new solicitation you call for a system to hold 1,400 storage containers measuring 24L x 24W x 19H.I n the questions - Item #2 you indicate that we bid the original specifications. <br /><br />The item list on the solicitation includes a total of 172 Sections of Shelving (156 mobile # 48 x 24; 12 Fixed @48 x 24 and 4 fixed #48 x 18). If each section was used to store 8 "CONTAINERS" (without any stored above the top shelf) this represents a total of 1376 which does not meet your requirement for storage of 1400 as outlined in the questions - Items #2, #8 and #25.</p>
<p><br />We need a total of 1400 sections to store 2800 bags. We prefer them all to be on a movable shelving system, but understand if it is not possible to fit them all. This is why we agreed to allow for fixed shelving to cover any over flow.<br /><br />B) In the new solicitation you call for "Moveable shelving system required to hold 1,400 storage containers measuring 24L x 24W x 19H. You also call for 48" wide shelving in both 24" and 18" depths. 48" Wide L&amp;T shelving is measured form the post centerline to post centerline. Additionally each post has a flange of 1/2" or more (depending on manufacturer - effectively reducing the front opening to 47" or less. Custom shelving is an option, but the rows would expand well beyond 28' (nominal) Unless the "containers" can be collapsed slightly, it would not be possible to store 2 such containers on a 48" wide shelf whether it is 24 or 18" deep. Please comment.</p>
<p>Please see "A"<br /><br />C) Since the new specifications calls for 8 moveable carriages 28' wide x 48" deep and 3 fixed carriages 28' wide x 48" deep; you have a required "Storage" areas on two sides (one at 7' and one at 5' deep This limits the space available for a moveable aisle system to a single entry system. From all of this, I would imagine that you have a specific layout of the mobile system in mind. Can you provide this plan?<br />We have not establish a set plan</p>
<p><br />D) Code compliance. It is my understanding that the Air Force does not have to comply with State and Local building codes. You have specified UBC compliance which limits the minimum aisle spacing to 36". Accordingly, a 24" minim aisle would not meet your specification. Please comment.</p>
<p>The Air Force does have to comply with all state and local building codes.</p>
<p><br /><br />E) Completion Date. Can you extend the completion date? As I indicated in an earlier email, a 9/30 completion date is still possible for us. However, everything will have to happen in a "best case" condition with no room for delays that typically happen in projects of this nature. An additional 30 days would provide time to have engineering completed before any parts of fabricated, allow for some flexibility in delivery times, an minimize potential problems that can result from condition beyond our control.</p>
<p>The completion date can not be extended</p>

PA has developed a distribution strategy that includes streaming and video blogging on state.gov, digital video encoding to YouTube, and contracts with thenewsmarket.com, and Pathfire, the two leading internet-based, global providers of video clips to news broadcasters.  The current capacity for this distribution is not meeting the daily demands, and requires doubling the capability just to get to an adequate level of output. Additional increases in media distribution strategies with the regional broadcast hubs across the globe, as well as media support for regional bureaus and posts requires PA to significantly increase our multimedia and multiformatting capabilities.    PA/OBS needs to expedite the delivery of this content to improve global audience reach and 2nd party placement of DOS video clips.   The timely and widespread delivery of this content is a critical success factor in communicating foreign policy and American values to a global audience.
The State Departments broadcast television production facility is a unique, state-of-the-art hybrid digital/analog platform that includes custom designed equipment for specialized applications. Telestream is the manufacturer and systems integrator of the specialized hardware and software that works together with other studio equipment to for digital video encoding and file transfer to external servers.  Telestream is the only company that can enable PA to increase this capacity without re-designing and re-integrating additional equipment at a greater expense for a new digital workflow, and its hardware and software allows for encoding to a diverse range of formats for use all over the world.The Department proposes to enter into this contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (1) only one available source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Departments requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY:  Dell High-End Computer Blades and Memory

RECOVERY:  THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.

NOTE THE CHANGES IN QUANTITY FOR ITEMS 0001 THROUGH 0009. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  FAR Subpart 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34 are being utilized for this acquisition.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) number SB1341-09-RP-0076. This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34. 

Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation.  Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Sandra Shaffner at Sandra.shaffner@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contract email address and phone number.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with a size standard of 100 employees.  This acquisition cannot be conducted as a total small business set aside because there is no U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed as an unrestricted full and open competition. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the items are located in an area only accessed infrequently by maintenance personnel.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: 
NIST currently has a Dell M1000e enclosure and blades in ITL.  By procuring Dell blades and enclosures under this acquisition, it would allow ITL IAD to use its existing Dell enclosure and blades as spares or as replacement parts.  This would save valuable compute time if we were to lose a part due to a hardware failure.  A Dell M1000e computer blade solution will reduce future operational costs and allows for flexibility in expanding computing capacity.  The new Dell computer blades will decrease the processing time for the evaluations.  The Dell blade enclosures will save valuable floor space in the labs while reducing the overall server and storage management and costs.  The Dell M906 blade infrastructure will reduce the number of servers and storage systems required (the quad core, 2.3 GHz processors can replace two older tower computer systems and the new disk drives in the blades are lower power, enterprise class, hard drives), it maximizes the rack space, and it will reduce the heat buildup in the labs which saves on air conditioning costs.  

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:
The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:
52.212-1, 
52.212-3,

(b) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause including this paragraph (b) in all subcontracts. 

52.204-11  AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT—REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause— 
“Contract”, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 
“First-tier subcontract” means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 
“Jobs created” means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
“Jobs retained” means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
“Total compensation” means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor’s past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 
(1) Salary and bonus. 
(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 
(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 
(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 
(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 
(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 
(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 
(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 
(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 
(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government’s on-line reporting tool. 
(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 
(4) Program or project title, if any. 
(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 
(6) An assessment of the contractor’s progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 
(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor’s workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide— 
(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor’s existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 
(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 
(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if— 
(i) In the Contractor’s preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received— 
(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and 
(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and 
(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. 
(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act. The contractor shall provide detailed information on these first-tier subcontracts as follows: 
(i) Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award and for the subcontractor’s parent company, if the subcontractor has a parent company. 
(ii) Name of the subcontractor. 
(iii) Amount of the subcontract award. 
(iv) Date of the subcontract award. 
(v) The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.

(ix) Subcontractor’s physical address including street address, city, state, and country. Also include the nine-digit zip code and congressional district if applicable.

(2) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants), and cooperative agreements; and 
(B) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Questions and Answers:

1.  I may have overlooked in the bid package where it may have indicated the annual usage.  It looked like orders would be for 840 cases at a time.  Is there any way to tell how often or how many times in a year we would expect to see that order?


Answer:  The numbers are just estimates but it equals about 70 cases per month or 35 every two weeks.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<DESC><p>***NOTICE***</p>
<p><br />Project, 060027 that was originally posted as FA8601-09-B-0013 as an Invitation For Bid (IFB) is now being posted as a Request For Proposal (RFP) under FA8601-09-R-0049.</p>
<p><br />***End Notice***</p>
<p><br />SYNOPSIS: Project ZHTV060027. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 270 days.</p>
<p><br />NAICS CODE: 238210. Size Standard $14M. Install Duplicate Electrical feed to Museum of the Air Force, Area B. Install cable, duct, and padmount switches to create new feed to existing loop circuits serving Museum of the Air Force and The Prairies. Load growth at these sites will cause the existing 250 kcmil cable to be insufficient to serve both loads if one side of the loop fails. Due to the long length of cable feeding these sites, repairs could take 1-3 days, and there is too much load to be restored by portable generator. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Special Requirement/Considerations: Work will need to be coordinated with the Exterior Electric Shop to allow them to switch electrical loads to accommodate the work with minimal customer electrical outages. Work on switches where power outages are required will need to be scheduled to minimize disruption. Work will require electrical contractor experienced with work on 12kV underground systems.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.</p>
<p>NOTES: 1. The solicitation with the official specifications and drawings will be available on the World Wide Web on or about 17 June 2009, at http://www.fbo.gov , as well as the following public bid room locations:</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification/Amendment 4 to DARPA-SN-09-47: Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor (HMMR) Workshop is to announce the following:

As a result of programmatic reassessments of emerging DARPA Programs, The HMMR Industry day scheduled for July 31, 2009 has been postponed.  Upon completion of these reviews, the revised date for the HMMR Industry Day will be published in FedBizOps.

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research to enable revolutionary advances for the rapid development and demonstration of lightweight, high-performance multi-material rotors  for current and future US Navy Submarine applications.  The ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate multi-physics performance prediction tools and multi-material manufacturing processes that can be successfully transitioned to the US Navy to improve performance and reduce weight and development costs of current and next-generation submarine rotors.  A large percentage of the acquisition cost of legacy US Navy submarine rotors is associated with non-recurring design, analysis, test, and evaluation iterations required to demonstrate the rotor’s performance.  These rotors are designed to simultaneously address multiple demanding maritime operational environment requirements using proprietary, uncoupled special-purpose domain codes (e.g., structural and hydrodynamic codes).  The current uncoupled nature of these legacy tool-sets is considered to be an impediment to shortening the rotor design cycle due to their inability to rapidly and accurately predict rotor off-design  performance (e.g., during standard maneuvers, crash-back, backing, and crash-ahead operations).  

Legacy US Navy submarine rotors are manufactured from Nickel-Aluminum-Bronze (NAB).  Although NAB material properties are well-understood, the dynamic performance and weight of NAB rotors are dictated by the rotor geometry.  Tailored multi-material (both organic and inorganic) systems offer the opportunity to provide improved dynamic performance and weight reduction unachievable with NAB.  However, transformational improvements in rotor design, analysis, and multi-material manufacturing methods are needed to exploit the potential benefits of multi-material rotors.  

The Hybrid Multi-Materials Rotor Workshop will be held at the Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd, Suite 300, Arlington, VA, 22201. There is no registration fee.  Details on the workshop, including registration and clearance submission information, can be found at the following URL: www.sa-meetings.com/HMMR2009.  The password for login is: Submarines.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is TBD, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted to add participants on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

Further questions about the workshop should be directed to DARPA-SN-09-47@darpa.mil.  Please refer to the HMMR Workshop in any correspondence.  

This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned. Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.

Point of Contact

CAPT Duane Ashton, DARPA/DSO; Email: DARPA-SN-09-47@darpa.mil.

Due to the classified nature of the event, all participants are required to pre-register and must have at least an active DoD SECRET Clearance to attend the workshop.  Participants must register and have their Security Office submit a Visit Request Form NLT 4 pm EST July 14, 2009, in order to attend.  Visit Request Forms are to be submitted via FAX to Han Ripley, Facility Security Officer, at 703-797-4575, or JPAS to SMO Code 446095.  Please include the subject "HMMR Workshop" in all submissions and correspondence.  

The workshop will be conducted at the classified SECRET level.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Tongass National Forest (the Tongass) recently finished its Forest Plan Amendment. To implement the amendment, the Tongass needs to develop project plans that allow implementation of the Forest Plan (the Plan) (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/2008_Forest_Plan.pdf) as described in the Record of Decision (ROD) (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Record_of_Decision.pdf). The complexity of the management situation requires a vegetation model to help implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Media_Files/Timber-AdaptiveMgmtStrategy_887040_300dpi.pdf). The model is needed to assist in the designing management strategies for actual on-the-ground projects that meet Forest Plan direction and display progress towards the forest’s desired condition. The model should have the ability to: analyze large inventory data sets and complex rules; calculate timber harvest level considering the Plan management goals, objectives, and constraints; project effects of management on wildlife habitats; perform financial efficiency analyses; and assist in the development of a road building and maintenance strategy.

A primary purpose of this acquisition is to train Tongass staff in using a vegetation model and to help develop a range of alternatives for feasible land management projects for a pilot project. The Tongass will select an initial project to evaluate a watershed (or perhaps a slightly larger area such as a Wildlife Analysis Area) with land management issues and objectives representative of the Tongass National Forest. Alternatives developed to implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy will need to project the development of forest conditions over time, quantify the effects on wildlife habitat, and determine a harvest level that meets the objectives of the Plan. Wildlife habitat will be evaluated with incorporating deer habitat models such as Hanley’s FRESH Deer Model (http://cervid.uaa.alaska.edu/deer/).  This acquisition also allows for any needed modifications to the vegetation model which are learned during the initial project and a full site license if the Tongass decides to adopt the model.

The model will be utilized to project the forest conditions over time by simulating the land allocations and management action of the alternatives.  The extent of this modeling effort when looked at from an entire plan revision perspective can seem large and complex. It is easier to understand the modeling by looking at the major components used in the model formulation. These major components  include; the GIS data which defines the land allocations and spatial representation of numerous  resources, the forest inventory data, growth and yield projections, road networks, the definitions of habitats and structural stages, the assumptions on habitat and structural stage development, and management assumptions to simulate the alternatives.

All arrangements for Contractor personnel travel, including airline reservations and motel accommodations, will be the responsibility of the Contractor.

PERFORMANCE PERIOD:
The anticipated period of performance for CLIN 001 through 003 is August 2009 – January 2010.

<a href="mailto:bill.geary@va.gov">bill.geary@va.gov</a>
<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsVISN 16Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (VAGCVHCS), Contracting Office, Biloxi, MS, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition for the Medical Administration Service (MAS). 2.	Nature/Description of ActionA new firm fixed price requirements contract for ambulance services is being contemplated under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Mobile Medic Ambulance Service (aka American Medical Response (or AMR)), 12020 Intraplex Parkway, Gulfport, MS  39503-4602, is the incumbent contractor and is the ambulance service that Harrison County, MS, has an agreement with to provide ambulance services to the citizens of Harrison County, inclusive of all cities located therein.    3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesThe requirement is to provide ambulance transportation services for beneficiaries of the VAGCVHCS in Biloxi, MS.  The mileage threshold (normal operating area) for the VAGCVHCS is entirely within the boundary bordered by Highway 609 (Washington Avenue) on the East, North and South by the Jackson and Harrison County lines, and on the West by Menge Avenue.  The ambulance services are also to include paramedics providing (when required) Advanced Life Support (ALS), cardiac monitoring, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) drugs and procedures, advanced airway management, and medication monitoring and administration in accordance with current Mississippi State Laws and Regulations governing the certification and licensure of private ambulances.  Also, Basic Life Support (BLS) is required for non-critical patient care in which patients require an ambulance staffed in accordance with current Mississippi State Laws and Regulations governing the certification and licensure of private ambulances.  At a minimum, the ambulances are required to be staffed with a vehicle operator and an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).  Response time is within 60 minutes of contact (20 minutes for emergency cardiac catheterization transfers).4.	Identification of Statutory Authority(X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:In December of 1994, Harrison County, Mississippi, entered into an agreement to have Mobile Medic Ambulance Service, Inc., provide ambulance service to the citizens of Harrison County, inclusive of all cities located therein.  The contract calls for Mobile Medic to be named as the Emergency Management Service (EMS) lead agency for Harrison County and the municipalities contained therein.  Mobile Medic, through its communications control center, coordinates all EMS activities in the County.  Mobile Medic has entered into mutual aid agreements with local fire departments and public safety agencies to insure appropriate response by public safety personnel and first responders.  Mobile Medic has been designated as the EMS secondary public safety answering point (PSAP) and thus all calls received by other PSAPs for ambulance service, including but not limited to 911 calls, will be transferred to the Mobile Medic control center.  Response time is within 60 minutes of contact (20 minutes for emergency cardiac catheterization transfers).  The agreement between Harrison County and Mobile Medic has been amended numerous times since 1994 and is currently extended through December 5, 2011.  Our opinion, and that of VA Regional Counsel, is that this agreement essentially creates a sole source situation as it basically blocks other companies from being able to provide similar services in Harrison County.  Because other companies do not perform ambulance services in the county, a situation where another ambulance service would (or could) come in just for the VAGCVCS' limited requirements is highly unlikely as it would not be cost effective for them (or for us) to operate just for the VAGCVHCS' needs.             b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:In accordance with FAR 5.201, a Presolicitation Notice will be posted on the FedBizOpps website notifying the commercial marketplace of the VAGCVHCS' intent to negotiate solely with Mobile Medic for ambulance services.  If any other potential offerors identify themselves at that time, we will immediately conduct additional market research to see if they can in fact provide the ambulance services required by the VAGCVHCS.  Past history tell us that when the VAGCVHCS has issued solicitations for these same type services, no one other than Mobile Medic has submitted an offer.  We believe that the agreement Harrison County has with Mobile Medic is the reason for this.             c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.Once our VA Form 2268 is approved to proceed on a sole source basis, a Presolicitation Notice will be placed on FedBizOpps website that will relay the VAGCVHCS' intentions accordingly.       d. If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.	N/A      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:	N/A6.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable CostThe Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable because a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract.  The Independent Government Estimate will also be used as a tool in helping determine price fair and reasonableness.  Market research will also be conducted to see if other VA facilities have contracted for similar services where their prices can possibly be compared to our situation.  By signing this justification, the Contracting Officer makes a determination that the costs/prices to the Government are expected to be fair and reasonable.         7.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.Market research was conducted to see how many ambulance services were operating in the United States.  The CCR search revealed that there were 895 different companies registered as providing ambulance services.  A more focused search was accomplished for the State of Mississippi only.  The CCR search revealed that there were 7 companies registered as providing ambulance services.  These 7 companies were spread-out throughout the larger metropolitan/populated areas of Mississippi and two of them appear to be misregistered (one was a fire equipment company and one was a day care center).  Market research has also discovered that smaller community hospitals in the more rural areas of the state often have their own ambulance services that they provide to the immediate area surrounding the hospital.  These ambulance services are only one or possibly two vehicle operations.  While there is no doubt that there are other companies who can perform ambulance services, we are not aware of anyone other than Mobile Medic who could perform them within the VA's area of coverage and within the required response time of 60 minutes of contact (20 minutes for emergency cardiac catheterization transfers).         8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:	N/Ab. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:	N/Ac.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSVETERANS INTEGRATED SERVICE NETWORK 6JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONFAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)1. CONTRACTING AGENCY:  The VISN 6 Centralized Acquisition Service, in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, intends to execute a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the following procurement. 2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The undersigned proposes to procure a K4b2 Pulmonary Gas Exchange System and supplies for the Richmond VA Medical Center.  3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The requested Pulmonary Gas Exchange System is needed for merit review grants measuring obesity and body composition in spinal cord injury patients.4. AUTHORITY CITED: Under the authority of Title 41 U.S.C. 254 (1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)1(i) other than full and open competition is justified when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agencys minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier.  The make and model of the Pulmonary Gas Exchange System from CosMed USA provides the technology and dimensions required by the VA to measure cardio-respiratory response in the field without any limitations.  It is distinctive in that it has telemetry transmission capability, as well as an integrated GPS system.  The unit also has the distinguishing characteristic of being very lightweight (800 g) and completely portable since it does not need to be tethered to a PC.5. REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: CosMed is the manufacturer and sole distributor of the K4b2 Pulmonary Gas Exchange System.  The unique features of this unit offer the transmission flexibility and mobility needed for metabolic testing in spinal cord injury patients.6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  An Intent to Sole Source was posted on FedBizOpps for 15 days.  No inquiries or responses were received.7. FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION: CosMed USA is giving the VA a 15% discount on the K4b2 Pulmonary Gas Exchange System and calibration syringes, and a 10% discount of the other supplies for a savings of over $5,000.00.  It has therefore been determined that the cost to the VA is fair and reasonable.8. MARKET SURVEY/RESEARCH:  Market research was conducted and products were researched on the world-wide web including GSA Advantage and medcompare.com. I could not find any Pulmonary Gas Exchange units with the same features offered by CosMed.9. OTHER FACTORS: There are no other facts to support other than full and open competition.10. INTERESTED SOURCES: No other sources have expressed an interest in this procurement.   11. AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Under the authorities and actions cited above and the fact there is no other available source, there are no actions to be taken to overcome barriers to competition.12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION: This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officers knowledge and belief.

<DESC>RATIONALE FOR A CONTRACT ACTION THAT IS NOT BOTH, FIXED-PRICE AND COMPETITIVE AS REQUIRED BY FAR SUBPART 5.7 - PUBLICIZING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINSVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. Type of Contract Action: SBA 8(a) non competitive contract modification identified in FPDS-NG as HUDCCHI00848, M0004.  This modification was issued on April 13, 2009 for a firm fixed price of $64,506. The description of the contract is for HUD USER and Regulatory Barriers Website Operations to exercise option-to-extend, a clause already in the contract for 4 months and to add Task 4 - Mapping System for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program Competition.

The request was to quickly add a new task so the current HUDUSER and Regulatory Barriers Website Operations contractor (Sage Computing, Inc.) to support  the Recovery Act programs requiring a competition in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP).
