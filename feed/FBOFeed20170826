<DESC><p>1. Solicitation Number: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SS-2017-768</p>
<p>2. Title: Purchase of a COPAS FP Flow Cytometer</p>
<p>3. NAICS Code: 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing</p>
<p>4. Description: <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The COPAS flow cytometer is a multifunctional, high-throughput piece of equipment which enables NIA laboratories to sort samples (e.g., C. elegans, Drosophila, Cell Clusters/cell colonies, small tissues; and fragile Cells), and quantify signaling intensities of these samples. One major application for this COPASTM flow cytometer is for the aging related C. elegans research. Like mice, the C. elegans is a widely used, well-accepted animal model for aging research. C. elegans has a short lifespan of around 3 weeks, and it shows similar aging features as in humans, including frailty, muscle atrophy, neurodegeneration, etc. In addition, many of the longevity genes are conserved from C. elegans to humans, such as SIR-2.1 (SIRT1 in humans) and DAF-16 (FOXO3 in humans). Compared with mice, studies on C. elegans are much more efficient and with far less cost, and this enabling C. elegans as a good model for the screening of anti-aging reagents. There are several laboratories at NIA use C. elegans as working models, including LMG, LNS, TGB, and LGG.</p>
<p>This equipment is also useful for laboratories which use cell clusters/cell colonies, small tissues; and fragile cells. For example, this machine can sort neuron clusters and cell colonies which cannot be done with current available flow cytometers in the NIA.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to acquire a COPAS flow cytometer for use in C. elegans, Drosophila, cell cluster, small tissue and fragile cell experiments.</p>
<p>Project requirements: <br />The contractor shall provide the NIA Laboratory of Molecular Biology with one COPAS FP-PRO system as follows:<br />1.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement.

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong> <br />The objectives of the DoD Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.
<p><strong>Three Phase Program<br /></strong>The SBIR Program is a three-phase program.</p>
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit,<br />technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. SBIR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of SBIR research or technology.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program, although modeled substantially on the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, is a separate program and is separately financed.

<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-STTR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. STTR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior STTR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the STTR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of STTR research or technology.</p>

<AWDDATE>083117
<DESC>Sole Source Justification
<p>One Source/Brand Name</p>
<p>1. Intended use of the supply of service.<br />Implement Geo5, which performs advanced geotechnical analysis. The software will enable the District to perform more comprehensive analyses for project design and construction support, and more effectively review work prepared by AE consultants that also use the software.</p>
<p>2. The critical or unique characteristics of the supply or service which are mandatory for the intended use.<br />Geo5 is both an analytical and finite element modeling software that enables the USACE Los Angeles District Geotechnical Branch to evaluate project designs and the impact of construction activities beyond conventional geotechnical analysis methods. Since the software can transfer the analytical solution into the finite element program, the District will be able to compare two independent solutions, thus increasing the safety of design. The software can model in two-dimensions the construction sequence and impact of typical District civil works projects, including integration of (for example) soil-structure interaction, groundwater/dewatering, excavation/backfilling, and seismic events; and can evaluate more realistically soil response/behavior (i.e. stress changes and deformation). These capabilities will benefit the District in refining project designs and minimizing/mitigating risk potentials.</p>
<p>3. Reason why only the selected "one source" or "brand name" can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of all other sources.<br />Geo5 is a widely used and recognized software program both in practice and academia. Many AE submittals to the District are also prepared using Geo5. Thus, it would be advantageous to acquire Geo5 to effectively review those submittals. The software developer, Fine Software, offers a strong customer support service.</p>
<p>4. Is this a follow-on or upgrade to a previous purchase? If yes, provide the purchase order number.<br />No</p>
<p>5. Describe efforts made to determine if other sources capable of satisfying the government's requirements exist:<br />Several other software programs exist (such as SIGMA/W and PLAXIS) that perform similar functions as Geo5. The District currently has SIGMA/W, which is a finite element program that is part of the GeoStudio suite. However, the program is not widely used and does not possess the same full capabilities that are offered by Geo5, including detailed modeling of the stability of rock slopes and advanced soil models. Input from SIGMA/W also cannot be exported easily to perform quality control review of the results. Because PLAXIS is based on elasto plastic material behavior, analysis is often more time consuming.</p>
<p>6. Basis for determination of a fair and reasonable price:</p>
<p><br />A. Current price list/catalog/advertisement: See attached pricing from Fine Software<br />B. Similar supply/service previously purchased: none<br />C. Value analysis: none</p>
