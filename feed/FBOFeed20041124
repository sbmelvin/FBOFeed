Additionally, DOJ employees will have access to the TTI/Vanguard members' website which offers audio slides from the conferences.  TTI/Vanguard serves a small membership community of about 55 member organizations with Information Technology as its singular area of concentration.  The membership will provide the DOJ access to early and advanced information about emerging and breakthrough technologies on the 2-5 year horizon and explore a broad range of technologies from a non-commerical, objective perspective.  Member organizations represent a broad cross-section of industries and the public sector and are senior business and technology executives with responsibility for creating and implementing strategic technological change within their organizations.  Members engage in collaborative sessions where paradigms are questioned, theories are tested, and opinions are shaped.  This is not a request for prosposal nor will a solicitation be issued.  It is within the discretion of the DOJ to compete this requirement if a determination is made that other companies can meet this requirement.

The number of operational RRF vessels varies depending on the sealift requirements of the U.S. Department of Defense.  This system should initially track the current operational RRF vessels, and continue to track so long as they remain operational.  We are looking for a Vessel Tracking System that will not require additional hardware or software to be installed on the RRF vessels or on MARAD HQ computers.  MARAD would like to utilize a Vessel Tracking System that is securely accessed through the Internet, and tracks the vessel using existing INMARSAT C satellite terminals on board the vessel. The period of performance will be one (1) base year with four (4) option years.  This solicitation is being set aside for small business. The solicitation will be available by electronic posting and and may be found at www.fedbizopps.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov and should be posted  on or about December 10, 2004.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia, has a need for a Non-Developmental, tactical bridge launcher.  This launcher is required to be integrated on an M1A1 chassis and employ the current United States Marine Corps MLC-70 Bridge,  providing wet and gap crossing capability to the Marine Air and Ground Task Force (MAGTF). 

A Request For Information (RFI) was released on 24 March 2004, a market survey was performed in March-May 2004, and a Capability Assessment was conducted from May-August 2004.  The results of these three events revealed that a domestic capability to meet the United States Marine Corps' needs using a non-developmental launcher does not exist.  However, the results of the Capability Assessment did indicate a foreign bridge launcher could meet the requirements.

The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia intends to negotiate as part of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT), with the following company: Alvis Vickers, Ltd. Scotswood Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE99 1BX,  United Kingdom.  This effort will procure (1) demonstration bridge launcher, test support, and logistics support enable a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to be conducted.  Upon completion of the FCT, an option may be exercised to procure (2) additional bridge launchers for Production Representative Prototype vehicles to facilitate further testing. The program Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is to procure a total of 22 Bridge Systems for the operating forces.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 621511   The National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, Ohio, intends to negotiate with a small business, on a competitive basis, for a project entitled "DNA Sequencing for Augmentation." The objective of this project is for a contractor to conduct  sequencing of environmental clone libraries developed by EPA personnel and provide sequencing data in electronic form. The contractor shall perform sequencing reactions on template provided by EPA personnel and provide sequence electropherograms to the project officer. The specific tasks are as  follows:  Task 1: Sequencing of environmental clones The primary task of this project is to generate sequence information from clone libraries. MCCB personnel will provide the DNA template that will be sequenced by the contractor in the form of bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli cells  transformed with TA plasmid containing the PCR clones.  The contractor shall perform the following steps: pick bacterial colonies and transfer colonies to growth medium, grow bacteria overnight at appropriate temperature, perform plasmid purifications and sequencing reactions, clean sequencing  reactions, and perform sequencing electrophoresis. Sequencing reactions will the performed with either M13F or M13R primers.  The primers will be provided by the sequencing company. It is estimated that 80 96 well plates of clones will be processed as part of this task. All clones will be sequence  in both directions using the aforementioned primers..  Task 2: Provide sequencing templates The contractor shall provide EPA with nucleic acid used as template for sequencing reactions. The nucleic acid could be in the form of plasmid or PCR product and it should be sent to project officer in a  frozen buffer to prevent degradation of extracted material. DELIVERABLES and DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE Both higher throughput and clean read outs (i.e., sequence electropherograms) are needed to complete this project. The readout has to be of high quality such that sequences obtained from clones  sequenced in both directions will overlap more than 75%.  Most clones will be of approximately 700 bp, but they could range between 400bp and 800 bp.  The primary output of each sequencing reaction should include a readout compatible with sequencing analysis software like Sequencher or DNA Star.  When clones are longer than 700 bases, the contractor shall provide a minimum of 650 bases per reaction of high quality (Phred  20).  Failure to accomplish this could require additional reactions.  As stated in Task 2, the contractor is expected to provide EPA with the remainder of the material  used for sequencing (i.e., purified plasmids or PCR products). To avoid nucleic acid degradation, the material should be shipped frozen to the project officer using overnight delivery.  The duration of the project is 12 months.  The contractor shall expect to deliver at least 25% of the total  analytical services herein requested every three months.  In other words, the contractor shall be capable of processing the minimum of 20 plates that will be submitted for sequencing during each three month period. All purified plasmids or PCR products should be sent to project officer at the end  each quarter. This acquisition is designated as a small business set aside under NAICS code 621511, the size standard of which is $11.5 million dollars. The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will  be issued on or about December 9, 2004. To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. Josh Bowers (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) by 10:00 AM EST THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, with North Carolina State University (NCSU) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide a web-accessible version of the municipal solid waste decision support tool (MSW-DST). The MSW-DST was created with EPA funding by Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in 1993, and was designed to evaluate multiple alternatives for MSW management in consideration of user-specific objectives. NCSU is a co-developer of this tool with  RTI. The MSW Management system considered by the model includes: 20 alternatives for the collection of residential, multifamily, and commercial waste; 5 alternatives for transfer stations to receive waste based on the manner in which it is collected; material separation in MRFs that receive  presorted or commingled recyclables or mixed waste; combustion with energy recovery; yard and mixed waste composting; and disposal of waste in a landfill (traditional, bioreactor or combustion residuals).  The current requirement is for a web-accessible version of this tool. Because NCSU and RTI  hold the intellectual property rights to the MSW-DST, no one has access to it and therefore cannot perform this work. NCSU has unique expertise in life-cycle modeling of solid waste management and familiarity with the tool and process models because of their role in its development through  partnership with RTI.  Since NCSU holds joint proprietary rights to this tool, and because of their unique familiarity with this project, they are the only known contractor capable of completing the requirements However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit  technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Thursday December 9, 2004 at 10:00 AM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541511. Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following  methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710-Research and Development and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The solicitation number is  RFQ-RT-05-00061, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal. (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-25.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order with a not-to-exceed line item is  anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation consisting of a twelve month period of performance. This procurement is for processing benthic macroinvertebrate samples collected from western streams and rivers in the US. Background: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part  of its Western Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) project, has collected benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) samples from streams and rivers in 12 western states ranging from small 1st-2nd order headwater streams to 6-7th order rivers.  The states are:  WA, OR, ID, MT, ND, SD, WY,  CO, UT CA, NV, and AZ.  Approximately 400 to 600 BMI samples were collected per year for four years.  Two types of samples are collected from most sites: (1) a quantitative riffle sample and (2) a quantitative systematic multi-habitat sample. The riffle sample is a composite of eight 1 ft2 kicknet  (500 micron mesh size) samples; the multi-habitat sample is a composite of 11 one square foot kicknet samples at systematically located transects.  The multi-habitat sample includes a mixture of erosional and depositional habitats.  Enough material is collected to contain at least 500 organisms in  each composite sample.  Samples are preserved in ethanol (to achieve a final concentration of 70% to 90%), shipped in one liter plastic bottles (HPDE) from the field to Corvallis, OR, then to the contractor to process the samples.  Although the target is to have a maximum volume of each sample  equal one liter or less, our experience is that many samples require several bottles. This survey of western streams and rivers was originally scheduled to cover four years.  However, recently, the field effort was extended for one(1) additional year, with approximately the same macroinvertebrate  field sampling effort requiring laboratory processing.  This contract is intended to cover processing samples collected during this final year of field sampling. Objective Statement: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities and equipment and otherwise do all things necessary  for, or incidental to, counting and classifying benthic macroinvertebrates in samples provided by EPA and shall provide to EPA datafiles containing the counts and taxonomy of each sample processed.  Task Description: 1.Sample Receipt.  The contractor shall inspect all samples upon receipt and  record the condition of each sample on a standardized tracking form that EPA will include in each shipment.  A copy of this form shall be returned to EPA via FAX, e-mail attachment, or mail. 2. Sample Processing. The contractor shall count and classify the organisms in an unbiased, representative  subsample of each composite sample to achieve enumeration of 500 (+/- 50) organisms and record the fraction of the sample processed or process the entire composite sample if it contains 500 or fewer organisms.  At least 10X magnification shall be used in sorting invertebrates from debris, and a  gridded tray or Caton-type splitter shall be used (or an equivalent method that will produce consistent subsamples).  In addition, a "large-rare" sweep of the subsample not counted shall be conducted (see Vinson and Hawkins, 1996.  J. North Am. Benth. Soc. 15:393-400). Counts from the large-rare  search shall be maintained separate from the 500-count subsample.  The contractor shall exclude organisms that are obviously not benthic macroinvertebrates such as planktonic microcrustaceans (e.g., Daphnia), terrestrial species, and obvious "accidentals".  Preserve these organisms, unsorted, in a  separate vial.   All sorted and counted specimens from each processed sample shall be archived in one or more vials; the unsorted portion shall also be archived.  Archived samples shall be preserved in 70% ethanol and vials labelled with a unique sample identifier.  Ten percent of the samples shall  be archived as follows as part of quality assurance: each taxon sorted and identified shall be retained in a separate vial containing 70% ethanol, with a unique sample identification label and taxonomic identification.  In addition, the contractor shall maintain a reference collection (voucher  collection) of all identified taxa.  The contractor shall archive the unsorted/uncounted portion of each sample until such time as the data are verified/validated.  The contractor shall be responsible for disposal of this portion of the sample after data verification.  The contractor shall return  the vials with sorted/counted specimens to EPA at the end of the contract.  3.Taxonomic Resolution.  The contractor shall standardize to a minimum level of taxonomic resolution to be achieved in all samples specified in Table 1.  The contractor shall classify to a finer level of resolution if it is  relatively straightforward.  All complete and fragmented individuals shall be counted if at least the head part is present.  Along with larvae, pupae and adults shall be identified and enumerated provided there is the ability to identify to the same taxonomic level as larvae.  We seek a  standardized level of taxonomy across all samples; at the same time we recognize that for some taxa, this goal is not reasonably achievable.  These circumstances shall be noted in a comments portion of the data files described next.  Data Files. Benthic data shall be summarized in two separate  files: 1.	A "sample information file", prepared in a matrix format, with rows (records) representing individual samples and columns (fields) representing variables associated with each sample.  The information in this file is applicable to an entire sample, and includes the following: a.  Information from the EPA sample label, including: (1)	EMAP stream identification code (ID code); (2) EMAP sample identification number; (3) EMAP habitat type (targeted riffle habitat or reach-wide); (4) Date of sample collection; (5) The total number of containers included in the sample; b.	Date  sample was received by contractor, c.	Contractor laboratory sample ID code (if different from EMAP ID or sample identification number) d.	Data qualifiers (flags) and comments regarding condition upon receipt or issues arising from laboratory processing and identification, e. Date sample processed,  f. Date all IDs were completed, g. Proportion of sample subsampled to obtain required count (500 +/- 10%); 2. The second data file shall contain the count data for all samples, and shall be organized as a matrix with each row (record) representing an individual taxon in a sample, and each column  (field) representing variables associated with each record.  The first four variables uniquely identify each sample and allow for merging with the sample information file.  These variables include: a.	EMAP stream identification code (ID code); b. EMAP sample identification number; c. EMAP habitat  type (targeted habitat or reach); d. Date sample collected; e. Individual variables that collectively provide the complete taxonomic information for each taxon, beginning with phylum and ending with the lowest taxonomic level assigned to a taxon, from Table 1 (species or higher depending on the  taxon), including any intermediate levels (e.g., tribe, subfamily, etc.);f. The unique taxon name assigned (generally genus plus species); g. Any taxon codes that might be assigned by the laboratory (i.e. that link to a lookup table of complete taxonomic information); h. The number of individuals  counted as part of the big/rare search; i. The number of individuals counted as part of the subsampling effort, or from the large-rare search; j. A variable code, such as "distinct", to indicate whether taxa not classified to the specified level in Table 1 are distinct from other taxa not  classified to that level in the sample; k. Any data qualifiers (flags) and associated comments pertaining to the identification of the individual taxon, including those that address the issue related to "undetermined" taxa presented under "Taxonomic Resolution". Data files are to be submitted  electronically in spreadsheet format (e.g. Microsoft EXCEL; SAS data files or compatible) either on diskette, CD-ROM or via internet (e.g., ftp or attachments to e-mail).  NOTE: Individual spreadsheet files for each sample (i.e., "electronic benchsheets") are not acceptable.  In addition, placing  information or data in "text boxes" inside spreadsheet files is not acceptable.  Contractor shall maintain a paper copy of the electronic files as well as a back-up electronic copy at a separate location (to prevent loss of data in the event of a catastrophe, e.g., fire, flood, earthquake). Quality  Assurance/Quality Control. 1. Sample processing:  Subsampling and sorting procedures shall be controlled and evaluated so that no more than 10% variation in taxonomic lists and counts is introduced.  A process such as the use of replicate subsampling/processing of 5% of the samples could be used to  quantify error rates and demonstrate achievement of this performance objective. 2. Taxonomy:  Contractor shall randomly review the taxonomic: Identifications of 10% of the samples weekly using a separate taxonomist. Uncertain taxa shall be sent to one or more outside experts for confirmation. 3.  Contractor shall assure that data entry is correct. 4. The contractor shall use a list of published taxonomic references with prior EPA approval. Deliverables. Electronic (and paper, if requested) files containing data on benthic macroinvertebrate samples received from EPA are due within 9 months  after samples are received from EPA. A QA report summarizing achievement of Performance Objectives is due with submission of the electronic data files within 9 months after samples are received from EPA. List of samples received from EPA 30 days prior to completion of this order. Voucher samples 30  days prior to completion of this order. QA samples for distribution to outside experts for taxonomic verification on request within 6 months after the effective date of the order. Period of Performance. The period of performance is 12 months after the effective date of the purchase order.  Proposal  Instructions and Evaluation Criteria: The Government intends to award a single purchase order to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable proposal offers the 'Best Value' to the Government price and other factors considered.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Jorge Troncoso Contreras, Jefe Departamento Control de Contaminación, Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente (CONAMA), Teatinos 258, 4° piso, Santiago, Chile, Phone: 56-2-240-5777; Fax:  56-2-240-5782.  Development of an Environmental Remediation Regulatory Framework. Chile’s National Environmental Commission, Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente, CONAMA (“Grantee”), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to carry out technical assistance on the development of a regulatory framework for environmental remediation projects in Chile. 

Reducing mining pollution is one of the eight cooperative projects targeted by the United States and Chile in Annex 19.3 of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  At present, Chile does not have a regulatory framework for environmental remediation projects, which is needed to define remediation standards and to ensure compliance.  

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to assist Chile’s National Environmental Commission (Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente, CONAMA) in the development of a regulatory framework for environmental remediation projects.  The TA will provide technical guidance and assess protocols for the development and implementation of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) process. The technical assistance will provide the foundation for the expeditious implementation of cost-effective remedial actions including the development and assessment of regulatory options for remediation projects financing. The technical assistance will focus on providing institutional strengthening directed toward improving CONAMA’s capability in developing and implementing the environmental regulatory framework for environmental remediation. As such, the assistance would include but may not be limited to guidance for developing clean-up standards for groundwater, surface water, and soil; protocols for site discovery and reporting, site hazards assessments; human health risk assessment procedures, remediation investigation and feasibility studies, quantitative risk assessments of cleanup action alternatives, preparation of cleanup action plans, administrative procedures for remedial actions.

The main tasks of the TA can be summarized as follows:

Task 1:  Remedial Investigation Guidelines and Protocols
The Contractor will prepare and provide written guideline for planning and conducting an environmental site assessment at contaminated sites. 

Task 2: Feasibility Study Guidelines and Protocols
The Contractor will prepare and provide written guidelines for evaluating remediation alternative approaches and for selecting preferred remediation alternatives. 

Task 3: Environmental Remediation Financing
The objective of this task is to identify and document funding mechanisms and regulatory protocols for the implementation of environmental remediation projects in Chile. The Contractor shall work with CONAMA to identify viable fiscal mechanisms and administrative procedures for undertaking remedial actions in accordance with the results of the RI/FS process. 

Task 4:  Environmental Remediation Workshops
The objective of this task is disseminate and provide training on the remediation guidelines prepared in Tasks 1 through 3. 

Task 5:  Preparation of Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $326,462 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission and desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 5:00PM, January 17, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Dynamics Technology, Inc., for Multi-Phenomenology Source Term and Propagation Modeling.  The primary objective of this effort is to develop an integrated modeling suite for prediction and characterizing multi-phenomenology signals emanating from equipment and facilities.  The modeling suite will consist of imported facility models, source term models, and multi-phenomenology propagation models.  The architecture will allow for the easy integration of future source term and propagation models.  The sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and existing products, concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with one-year basic contract period and a 1-year option period.  This effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541330/$23.0 million.  Reference Note 22 Applies to this synopsis.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.

<DESC>UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate System of Systems Integrator Workshop posted today. The synopsis, which was truncated, is replaced in its entirety with the following:   NASA is hosting a workshop entitled  "End State Options and Acquisition Strategies for the NASA Exploration System of Systems Integrator"  December 15-16, 2004 in Pasadena, CA.  This workshop is a major splinter session to the Exploration Systems Technology Interchange Meeting being held December 13-17, 2004 at the same location.   The objective of this workshop is to solicit input from a broad range of sources regarding options and strategies for NASA to consider in designing the strategy to acquire the System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SoSE&I) capability.  The focus of the workshop is on the final end state SoSE&I capability to be put in place in the 2009 time frame to support the development of Constellation Spiral II and beyond, as the nation returns humans to the Moon in preparation for the long term goal of exploring Mars.  End State Options are not limited to traditional NASA-contractor relationships, rather NASA expects other novel approaches to also be   considered.  Additional background information on candidate approaches will be posted early next week at the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Acquisition Portal at:  <A HREF="http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/index.html"> http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/index.html</A>   Acquisition strategy considerations will also be discussed including teaming/partnering options, degree of hardware exclusion needed to avoid conflict of interest, NASA policy implications, needed statutory and regulatory authorities; contract type, award and incentive fee structure options; and cost, schedule and tactical implications associated with the transitioning from the near/mid-term SoSE&I capability now being implemented, to the End State SoSE&I capability.  Participation is sought from traditional and non-traditional aerospace companies non-aerospace companies, Federally Funding Research and Development Centers, consultants, universities, and non-profit organizations, as well   as NASA personnel.  Please contact Mr. Craig Cornelius at craig.cornelius-1@nasa.gov or 202-358-1041 by no later than December 6, 2004 to request an invitation. Please contact Neville Marzwell at 818-354-6543 or neville.i.marzwell@jpl.com  for logistics and registration once you receive an invitation.  Participation is by invitation only and registration fees apply.  The workshop will be at the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel, 1401 South Oak Knoll Avenue, Pasadena, CA  91106 , telephone 626-568-3900,  <A HREF="http://www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/huntington/"> http://www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/huntington/</A>

<DESC>Amendment #3, issued 11/04/2004 The purpose of this Amendment is to respond to questions received and to extend the due date for information to 11/08/2004 in leiu of 11/05/2004. 1. Question: In the requested brief paper addressing the issue of small business set aside? Response: Yes 2. Question: Is issuing no other questions at this time to be answered at this time? Response: Yes, that is correct. 3. Question: Is the agency not requesting pricing information at this time? Response: Yes, that is correct. We are not requesting pricing information at this time. 4. Question: Would you please clarify the statement in the RFI that counseling services "in overseas location....be provided by US citizen". Does that mean that licnsed counselors who are fluent in English and who reside in foreign countries, but are not US citizens ma not provide face-to-face services? Response: All certified and qualified counselors must be a US citizen and must reside in the US. Expatriots living abroad are not acceptable. 5. Question: Is the desired intent to maximize access to information/resources via the internet, telephone and email, and to maintain a 6 session face-to-face EAP model for clinical services? Response: Yes, that is correct. 6. Question: The RFI identifies health and wellness, elder care, parenting and child-care.... and references something as Tri-Care. Can you clarify the terminology "Tri-Care" for me? Response: Tri-care is the medical for the military community. Our RFI is Amended to remove the need for the nurse line requirement. 7. Question: In approaching the development of an international network of providers, the six face-to-face session must stay within the 50% subcontracting limitation. Is that correct? Response: Yes, that is correct. The counselors who provide the six face-to-face sessions must have proper creditials and qualifications, and must be US citizens residing within the US. Our concept is to have one network that ensures that all providers are qualified and that the network is properly managed for quality. This RFI is to encourage industry to present alternative or innovative industry solutions. If splitting the work life center from the counseling is viable, please would like industry to provide an explaination as to how this could be approached. 8. Question: Is contractor required to give direct counseling to military community or will contractor refer military community to such assistance via internet, telephone and email? Confused due to given Class Code G - Social Services and NAICS 624190. Response: Response has been addressed above. If Class Code G and NAICS Code 624190 is confusing, can you explaination what Class Code and NAICS industry recommends for this type of service? In addition to the responses, we would like to clarify that the correct email address to be used is: FTS.R10Acquisition@gsa.gov That's FTS(period)R10Acquisition@gsa(period)gov

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Denver, CO, intends to acquire work-life and employee assistance program services on behalf of the Department of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense (ODUSD), Military Community and Family Policy.   This Request for Information seeks the opinions and suggestions of both large and small businesses on the most efficient and effective methodology to acquire and deliver these services while optimizing small business participation.   The services support the Military OneSource program which provides 3 million members of the Armed Forces and their families, at locations worldwide, with access to a broad array of information and counseling services through the internet, telephone, and e-mail.   This program must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   The contractor will interact with the client community, furnishing referrals to information and services through a call center or on-line service.   The contractor is required to maintain a database of employee assistance providers which will then be utilized to refer military clients to the appropriate service provider through internet based tools or through master consultants staffing the call center.   The contractor is required to field calls for assistance with issues such as substance abuse, emotional well being including suicide, health and wellness, disability, legal, financial, elder care, parenting and child care, education services, relocation, Tri-care, and general every day issues.   The contractor must also provide a Nurse Line.    Service providers must be able to refer clients to military provided services and resources.   In addition, be able to inform military authorities of a crisis situation.   The military population must have one number/address to use to reach the service providers no matter where they or their family members are located.   Face-to-face counseling services will be limited to 6 per issue, and when these services are required in overseas locations, they will be provided by US citizens.   Travel from the US to overseas locations will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations.

The services are currently provided under a teaming arrangement between two large businesses under a task order against two Federal Supply Schedules, Human Resource Management and Management, Organization, and Business Improvement Services.   A new contract must replace this order by February 2005.   It is anticipated that a draft solicitation will be issued in November 2004.   

Please respond with a brief, informal paper addressing some or all of the following questions:  Is it feasible to set-aside all or a portion of these services for small business?   Does a small business have the resources and capacity to manage a program of this magnitude (please expand on this topic)?   If a small business set-aside is pursued, would the small business be able to provide a network of providers worldwide and still adhere to the limitation on subcontracting of 50% (50% of the work must be performed by the contractor’s own employees)?   If a recommendation is to divide the employee population into smaller contract portions, perhaps geographically, how would separate contractors interact with each other to provide the military population with uninterrupted, quality service?    If there are multiple contractors, how would a family that is separated by distance or is disbursed temporarily over several locations easily access services, and how would data on their cases be maintained or shared?   What type of quality oversight is the industry practice?    How would that oversight be accomplished with multiple small business contract holders?   If your recommendation is that the procurement not be set-aside for small business, how do you envision a program of this size being managed while achieving the greatest utilization of small businesses?   Small businesses are invited to also provide a description of their firm’s capabilities.

Responses can be sent in writing before November 5 by e-mail to FTS R10 Acquisition@gsa.gov.    Response sent via US Postal Service can be address to Ms. Jeny Pomber 10TQ, GSA FTS, 400 15th Street SW, Auburn, WA 98001.   Questions or concerns may also be sent in writing to Jeny.Pomber@gsa.gov.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a commercial acquisition under FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Computer Science Innovations, Inc. (CSI), a subsidiary of Essex on behalf of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), for services to NPP Data Evaluation Support.  Services are for maintenance of AFTAC unique automated data storage, retrieval and manipulation tools, as well as management oversight tools.  The anticipated period of performance is for a three month period from 1 Dec 04 to 28 Feb 05.  This acquisition is justified FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the work to be performed indicates that, because of the short period of performance for this service, only one contractor has the requisite experience and required knowledge of AFTAC unique database and support tools, project management, and administrative tasks.  No other firm could gain the knowledge required for performance given the proposed length of the contract.  Purchase Order No. FA2521-05-P-0041 will be issued as a Request for Quotation.  This proposed procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  It is advertised with a NAICS code for this acquisition is 541511 and Small Business size standard is $21M.  No solicitation documents exists at this time.  The 45th Contracting Squadron has determined that Computer Science Innovations, Inc. (CSI) is the only source capable of providing the necessary services.  Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort should provide evidence of technical capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC) Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, Virginia is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement for the operations, maintenance and support (O, M, & S) of Prepositioned War Reserve Materiel (WRM) stored in the Sultanate of Oman, State of Qatar, and State of Bahrain.  Services also require the operation of a supply stock control function and contractor liaison office at Shaw AFB, SC.  The United States Central Command Air Forces (USCENTAF), the designated air component of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), uses pre-positioned WRM to support apportioned forces deployed to Southwest Asia (SWA).  Pre-positioning is a force multiplier for providing bare base systems; medical; munitions; Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP); Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE); vehicles; rations; Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE); Air Base Operability (ABO) equipment; and associated spares and other consumables at designated operating locations.  In the past, WRM operating locations have included SEEB, Oman; Thumrait, Oman; Masirah, Oman; Al Udeid, Qatar; Manama, Bahrain and Albany Georgia.  The performance period will be a four (4) month phase-in period, a base period of one (1) year, and six options for one (1) year each.  The Government is contemplating a cost-plus-award fee type contract to fulfill this requirement based on historical data and past market research.  The NAICS Code 561210 is applicable to this effort.  This is not a formal Request for proposal, and no contract will result from this synopsis.  A draft RFP is likely to be issued in order to obtain industry comments on the requirement.

(4) What type of corporate experience do you have that is similar to the type of work described above? (5) How many years of corporate experience does your firm have with requirements of this nature? (6) Of this experience, what has been the magnitude of the requirements? The Government anticipates a site visit in Southwest Asia on or about 2 Jun 05 and a Pre-proposal Conference at Langley AFB, VA, on or about 23 June 05.

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy ships. Presently, ships carry a large variety of routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use. The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to reduce the proliferation of numerous authorized cleaning agents listed on the Ship’s Hazardous Materials List (SHML).  NSWCCD-SSES is currently in the process of  a drafting Technical Purchase Description (TPD) for hand sanitizers (used in dispensing systems).  The TPD describing the ! requirements for the hand sanitizer is posted on our website http://www.dt.navy.mil/acquisition/acq/announce/ann.html.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Denver, CO, intends to acquire work-life and employee assistance program services on behalf of the Department of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense (ODUSD), Military Community and Family Policy.   This Request for Information seeks the opinions and suggestions of both large and small businesses on the most efficient and effective methodology to acquire and deliver these services while optimizing small business participation.   The services support the Military OneSource program which provides 3 million members of the Armed Forces and their families, at locations worldwide, with access to a broad array of information and counseling services through the internet, telephone, and e-mail.   This program must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   The contractor will interact with the client community, furnishing referrals to information and services through a call center or on-line service.   The contractor is required to maintain a database of employee assistance providers which will then be utilized to refer military clients to the appropriate service provider through internet based tools or through master consultants staffing the call center.   The contractor is required to field calls for assistance with issues such as substance abuse, emotional well being including suicide, health and wellness, disability, legal, financial, elder care, parenting and child care, education services, relocation, Tri-care, and general every day issues.   The contractor must also provide a Nurse Line.    Service providers must be able to refer clients to military provided services and resources.   In addition, be able to inform military authorities of a crisis situation.   The military population must have one number/address to use to reach the service providers no matter where they or their family members are located.   Face-to-face counseling services will be limited to 6 per issue, and when these services are required in overseas locations, they will be provided by US citizens.   Travel from the US to overseas locations will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations.

The services are currently provided under a teaming arrangement between two large businesses under a task order against two Federal Supply Schedules, Human Resource Management and Management, Organization, and Business Improvement Services.   A new contract must replace this order by February 2005.   It is anticipated that a draft solicitation will be issued in November 2004.   

Please respond with a brief, informal paper addressing some or all of the following questions:  Is it feasible to set-aside all or a portion of these services for small business?   Does a small business have the resources and capacity to manage a program of this magnitude (please expand on this topic)?   If a small business set-aside is pursued, would the small business be able to provide a network of providers worldwide and still adhere to the limitation on subcontracting of 50% (50% of the work must be performed by the contractor’s own employees)?   If a recommendation is to divide the employee population into smaller contract portions, perhaps geographically, how would separate contractors interact with each other to provide the military population with uninterrupted, quality service?    If there are multiple contractors, how would a family that is separated by distance or is disbursed temporarily over several locations easily access services, and how would data on their cases be maintained or shared?   What type of quality oversight is the industry practice?    How would that oversight be accomplished with multiple small business contract holders?   If your recommendation is that the procurement not be set-aside for small business, how do you envision a program of this size being managed while achieving the greatest utilization of small businesses?   Small businesses are invited to also provide a description of their firm’s capabilities.

Responses can be sent in writing before November 5 by e-mail to FTS R10 Acquisition@gsa.gov.    Response sent via US Postal Service can be address to Ms. Jeny Pomber 10TQ, GSA FTS, 400 15th Street SW, Auburn, WA 98001.   Questions or concerns may also be sent in writing to Jeny.Pomber@gsa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  
The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct research that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  
The Air Warfare Battlelab is soliciting industry for a possible solution to the ongoing problem of ice and snow build up in the aileron and elevator balance bays on KC-135 model aircraft.  During winter months, blowing snow packs into these areas.  Aircraft are inspected and are not cleared for flight until the balance bays are completely cleared.  After snow or ice intrusion, it is difficult to clear the bay because the dimension between the aileron or the elevator is only one inch.   If a permanent structural change isn’t proposed, any item or tool, or other procedure must be used or performed by flightline personnel and must be durable to withstand severe winter environments.   The Air Warfare Battlelab is requesting products or technologies that both prevent snow/ice intrusion in these areas, and ease in clearing the bays if ice/snow is present. 
See the attached pictures for the dimensions of the balance bay wing and elevator areas. The specifications are as follows:
1.	Durable to withstand harsh operating environments
2.	Must be light weight for quick installation if required 
(work/rest cycles are 15 minutes on, 45 off in severe cold)
3.	Require no more than 2 personnel to install
4.	Be able to be installed/used in high winds 
5.	Be able to withstand temperatures to 50 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.  
6.	If electrically operated, must be safe to use during aircraft refuel/defuel and must run on 120-volt 60-cycle power
 
The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is to solve this problem.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:
1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the capabilities needed for the above problem.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 20 Dec 04 to Capt Dean Ramsett, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Early submittals would be appreciated.  Capt Ramsett can be reached at (208) 828-3546.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.

<SUBJECT>99--NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE SYSTEM OF  SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR WORKSHOP
<DESC>NASA is hosting a workshop entitled  “End State Options and Acquisition Strategies for the NASA Exploration System of Systems Integrator”	December 15-16, 2004 in Pasadena, CA.  This workshop is a major splinter session to the Exploration Systems Technology Interchange Meeting being held December 13-17, 2004 at the same location.   The objective of this workshop is to solicit input from a broad range of sources regarding options and strategies for NASA to consider in designing the strategy to acquire the System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SoSE&I) capability.  The focus of the workshop is on the final end state SoSE&I capability to be put in place in the 2009 time frame to support the development of Constellation Spiral II and beyond, as the nation returns humans to the Moon in preparation for the long term goal of exploring Mars.  End State Options are not limited to traditional NASA-contractor relationships, rather NASA expects other novel approaches to also be considered.  Additional background information on candidate approaches will be posted early next week at the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Acquisition Portal at:	 http://www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/huntington/

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N00421-10118051 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 200125 and DCN 20040930.  This action is set aside for small businesses.  The applicable NAICS is 334119 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS with NATIONAL INSTRUMENT under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  NATIONAL INSTRUMENT is the sole qualified supplier of this equipment at the present time. They have the proprietary rights to the patent and the cards.  They currently do not have any distributors of this product. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability.  All proposals received by 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time, 10 Dec 2004 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.  Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.

The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.

In the event of a conflict the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule.

MANDATORY SHIPPING DIRECTIONS

PCO Logistics:

	PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination. Delays resulting from failure to follow the above steps may be assigned as the contractor’s responsibility.

Is there a possibility that our instructor could be housed on base while delivering the classes? <br> *	Answer:  Accomodations on base will not be provided for instructors. <br><br> 17.	Are you able to provide specifics on which Microsoft Exchange 2003 courses are required?  Is the complement of courses the same for all locations? <br> *	Answer:  MS 2400 Implementing and Managing MS Exchange Server 2003 or equivalent is the appropriate course material.  Content will be the same for all locations. <br><br> 18.	Cost for transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses incurred by personnel are subject to limitations contained in the Federal Travel Regulations.    Typically, we bill these expenses after the travel has occurred following FAR requirements.
