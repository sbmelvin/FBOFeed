The Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch (GTTB) at the NIDCR/NIH conducts research related to the diagnosis, prevention and management of salivary gland diseases.  Primary efforts are directed at using gene transfer technology and are supported by basic research on virology, salivary secretion and function.  The GTTB has been developing a replication deficient recombinant serotype 5 adenovirus (rAd5) vector, which is designed to transfer the cDNA encoding human (h)AQP1 to adult patients with reduced function of their parotid glands due to ionizing radiation (IR) received in the course of treatment for a head and neck cancer.  hAQP1, the archetypal water channel, is a plasma membrane protein that facilitates water movement across lipid bilayers.  AdhAQP1 is intended for administration to a single parotid salivary gland with a purpose of increasing salivary secretion from that gland.  Acquisition of clinical grade, replication-deficient, serotype 5 adenovirus encoding human (h) AQP1 that is produced and packaged in a manner suitable for use in human clinical studies, including necessary quality control testing is essential and required.  It is the NIH's belief that only the GMP Core of the Belfer Gene Therapy Core Facility at Weill Medical College of Cornell University should appropriately produce the 100 flask preparation of Clinical Grade AdhAQP1.

Cornell University is the only know vendor to NIDCR that can meet the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if interested companies may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirements with a commercial product/service within 15 days of this notice.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items, and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5, the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items..  A determination by the NIH not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the NIH.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determing whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Address responses to the attention of Marcia Goldman at National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, MSC 7663, Bethesda, MD 20892-7663.

The ACRF is a 14-floor structure that houses clinics and laboratories on each of 12 floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and PET, surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.

The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium at the core of the building that connects four separate sectors that house occupants.  There are two objectives that the Clinical Center strives to meet.  The first is to ensure that environmental services in the Clinical Center, the hospital at the NIH, meets nationally recognized guidelines for environmental infection control in order to maintain a safe, clean health care environment.  The second is to maintain a satisfactory level of environmental services in the laboratories and support service areas, since these areas are critical, both to the effective operation of the hospital, as well as the research mission of the NIH.

All designated areas require servicing 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS/ORA intends to negotiate with the University of  Maryland, Center for Innovation College Park, MD on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c) (1) only one source to provide for the continuation of the Development of a Monitoring and Evaluation System for the Office of Research Applications. Up dates are needed to the University of Marylands report in order to complete required information. This is to modify and extend the previous year’s contract with the Office of Research.  The objectives are (1) A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE Research Environment survey to provide more information to management, especially to provide the basis of making organizational changes, and (2) establishing the recent history of product innovation and of scientific publications in ORA. These objectives supplement the performance management system that was developed in the previous work and will form the basis of two (2) separate reports to be delivered to ORA. This will extend analysis of the ORA response to the Research Environment survey which was substantially modified to make it useful to ORA management, particularly with regard to innovation and publication rates. The three foci of the extended analysis are the time allocations among various activities, the comparison of now and preferred scores on a number of the attributes of the research environment survey, and the patterns of networking.  

Offerors certain they can meet the requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Sally Huber Contract Specialist. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The objective of the Mainframe Application Conversion Pilot Project is to investigate the feasibility of using automated methods and services to solve the business problem of converting the Bank’s mainframe-based, legacy, NATURAL/ADABAS applications to an alternative Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle environment.  To that end, the contractor that possesses this type of automated conversion technology will take one of our existing mainframe-based, NATURAL/ADABAS applications and to use their technology to produce a fully functional application using processes that could serve as a model for the complete conversion and implementation of NATURAL/ADABAS legacy applications to a Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle, web-enabled environment.  The delivered application is to capture and preserve the general functionality, business rules, business logic and operational integrity of the original application, while freeing us from the expensive and outdated technologies on which these critical IT assets were originally built.  The delivered application should also be sustainable without requiring the availability of the contractor that performs the conversion.  During this pilot project, the Contractor will be expected to demonstrate the viability, reliability and efficiency of their automated conversion solution.  In addition, the Contractor will be asked to use their experience with conversion of the selected system and information provided to them on our other existing mainframe-based systems to estimate (non-binding) the cost and time that are reasonable for the replacement of the remainder of those systems.

The selected contractor will be asked to:
1.	Compare available application server environments and provide the Bank with recommendations on which HW/SW platform we should use for the converted application.
2.	Perform the conversion of one of our small mainframe-based applications in a relatively short time frame and assist in deploying the converted system in the selected test environment.  Additional data fields and tables will be added to the database for future enhancements.
3.	Make corrections to the application during the testing period and until completion of the quality assurance phase where we have verified that it performs exactly the way the mainframe-based application did.
4.	Provide limited (about 120 hours) of consulting services for enhancements/added limited functionality to the converted applications.
5.	Analyze our other mainframe applications and provide us with a non-binding estimate of both the cost and time it would take to migrate the remainder of our mainframe-based applications into our new environment.

PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT THEIR OFFERS ELECTRONICALLY OR VIA FAX. IF HARD COPY IS TO BE SUBMITTED, YOU ARE ADVISED TO USE A COURIER SERVICE IN LIEU OF THE U.S. MAIL, DUE TO THE TIME LAG ASSOCIATED WITH MAIL SERVICE.

<SOLNBR>GS11P05MKC3002
<CONTACT>Denise Avery-Craft, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-5742, Fax 202-708-4982, Email denise.avery-craft@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings.  Project Summary:  GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for all construction services necessary to construct a major addition to the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC), located at 4000 Arlington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia.  The estimated construction cost is $15 million to $25 million.  All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards.  The existing NFATC facility consists of a series of existing buildings totaling approximately 400,000 gross ft2 of space on a 72-acre campus setting bounded by Arlington Boulevard and George Mason Drive. The existing facility will remain occupied and in operation throughout the duration of construction. Each individual of the Contractor and sub-contractors who have any connection with this work will be required to obtain Government security clearances.  The proposed NFATC addition will accommodate a variety of administrative, instructional, multipurpose and storage space totaling approximately 133,000 gross ft2, constructed as two new interconnected three and four-story buildings located on the south-east portion of the existing campus. The basic exterior materials are brick, precast concrete panels, and glass.  A portion of renovation will be required at the point where the new and existing buildings meet as well as renovation work in the existing central plant building.  In addition to the base project, several options have been identified that may be exercised at the discretion of the GSA. The options are as follows: Option I  - Provide an addition and renovation to the existing detached Childcare Facility. This one-story addition represents approximately 9,200 gross ft2 of classroom and support space for the Childcare Facility. The basic exterior material is wood.  Option II - Provide redevelopment of a portion of the existing site for approximately 120 on-grade parking spaces.  Option III - Provide classroom Audio Visual Systems. Option IV - Provide an addition and renovation to the existing detached Visitor Center.  This one-story addition represents approximately 4,000 gross ft2 of assembly space.  The basic exterior material is brick.  Option V - Provide an addition and renovation to the existing Dining Facility.  This one-story addition represents approximately 1,600 gross ft2 of assembly space.  The basic exterior materials are brick and glass.  Option VI  - Provide approximately 10,500 gross ft2 of finished interior construction.  The Childcare addition and renovation portion of the project are being designed to meet LEED certification to the Silver Level.    Procurement Strategy: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, GSA will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal to price.  The selection process will have two stages. Stage I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Stage II.   Stage II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value.    In Stage I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors.    Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ.    The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.   Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Stage II of the procurement.    Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Stage I will not be allowed to participate in the remaining stage of the procurement.    In Stage II, the Government will issue the RFP, which will include the 100% construction documents (drawings and specifications), to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Stage I that elect to participate in Stage II.    The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Stage II.    The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP.  Based on the Stage I and Stage II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government.    The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Stage I and Stage II offers without discussions.    The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about September 12, 2005, on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.    Opportunities for Other than Large Businesses:    This procurement will be open to large and small business firms.    Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.    Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and FAR Subpart 19.702, an offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a subcontracting plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.  In this procurement, GSA intends to promote subcontractors' use of registered apprenticeship programs.

Statement of Work

HU-25 Horizontal Stabilizer P/N MY20331-16
	16 August 2005

OVERVIEW:
While performing NDI inspection, a cracked fitting was discovered.  This was the only discrepancy noted, the remaining fittings and structures were found to be serviceable.  This SOW is intended to address only the replacement of the aft attachment fitting.  However, it is recognized that during the process of a repair scheme development, circumstances may arise which could not be anticipated.  For such instances, direct communication with the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, HU-25 Engineering Cell will be required.  These communications shall be for the purposes of clarification only and shall not be construed by the contractor as authorization for an increase in the scope of work being performed.  In the event discussions result in the need for a change, the contractor shall not perform additional work until so authorized by modification to the delivery order by the Contracting Officer.  LCDR Chip Hatfield (252-335-6887) or CWO Dorsey Johr (252-335-6310) are the POCs for any relevant questions.  

Horizontal stabilizers are serial tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).

WORK SCOPE:
Remove and replace the Horizontal Stabilizer Aft attachment Fitting P/N MY20331-33 IAW per Dassault Falcon Jet specifications, procedures and drawings.  Fitting replacement is essential to provide the Coast Guard with a spare horizontal stabilizer to ensure continued and safe flight operations of the HU-25 fleet.  This Statement of Work describes the tasks that are required to replace the fitting. These tasks entail review of similar repairs developed for the civilian Falcon 20/200 fleet and tailoring of these repairs for application on the HU25. 

REQUIREMENTS: 
•	Remove and replace Aft Fitting P/N MY20331-33
•	Install new aft fitting bushings
•	Provide a Component Repair record (CRR) describing the repair.  The CRR will be used to update Significant Component History Report (SCHR).

<DESC>N00244 Naval Base 937 North Harbor Drive San Diego, CA Laura Maxwell 619-532-2365 This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to the authority FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii).   See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 339113. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to Depuy to provide total hip and knee systems with components and instrumentations for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  The requirement includes all materials and equipment necessary to maintain the Depuy hip and knee replacement systems instrumentation and implants currently owned by the Naval Medical Center, San Diego. The vendor must have the ability to deliver the required products with 1 to 2 hours for acute trauma (24 hours per day/ 7 days a week).  The vendor will deliver standard replenishment requirements in 1 to 2 business days, unless specified otherwise.  A consultant will be available 24 hours per day/ 7 days a week for technical assistance, pre, peri, and post-operatively.  Quarterly in-services/ updates shall be provided for surgical staff.  Contractor must be in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) regula! tions.  Invoicing must be on a 30-day billing cycle and must be received by the orthopedic department within 5-10 working days of the following month.   Depuy is the only known source in the San Diego area that can perform the specialized hip and knee system services in accordance with the NMCSD’s urgent delivery schedule.  The members of the NMCSD Orthopedic Total Joint Surgical Team are all trained to use the Depuy systems, and any discontinuity in systems could potentially cost the Government more money in surgical training or ultimately jeopardize patient care.  These surgeons have been schooled in utilizing a particular joint system, and any variance in their procedures would ultimately cause non-financial costs of adjusting to a learning curve.  It would cause a significant downtime before surgeons would be proficient enough to confidently perform surgeries using the new joint systems.  Many of the patients at the Naval Medical Center, San Diego have a need to be treated as soon as possible and cannot risk delays caused from this learning curve.   Depuy, offers a total knee replacement with long-term proven results in the PFC Sigma system.  They are the only company to offer a rotating platform tibia (M.B.T. tibial tray), designed to greatly reduce backside wear, which is a problem with all other modular tibial trays.  In addition, the PFC Sigma system offers a complete range of augments and stems for revision arthroplasty with bone loss.  The TC3 system provides for increased constraint when soft tissue structures are inadequate. Depuy offers excellent total hip replacement systems as well.  The Pinnacle modular cup offers multiple liner options including highly crosslinked polyethylene and metal-on-metal.  These articulations, like ceramic, have been shown in laboratory and clinical testing to reduce wear debris and failure from aseptic loosening.  The Summit hip stem offers an outstanding design for primary THA in both cemented and press-fit versions.  The S-ROM hip stem is a well-established unique modular system that is ideal for many revision cases and cases with altered anatomy such and developmental hip dysplasia. The proposed contract is for a base period of one year, from 1 November 2005 through 31 October 2006, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 19 September 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Laura Maxwell at 619-532-4957.  Mailed documen! ts will not be accepted.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only.   Solicitation N00244-05-T-0923 issued to Depuy will be posted to www.neco.navy.mil on or about 19 September 2005.

SCOPE OF WORK

The USNA is looking to purchase an AppMan System in response to a requirement to better assure the performance, integrity, and security of our application infrastructure. We are looking to start from the network management perspective and bring server, application, and other management domains under one umbrella and an Application Management System which does exactly this.
The AppMan System needs to report performance for key business functions, sites, and services, and prioritize troubleshooting, including an application services topology that helps visualize and explore the flow of application services between business entities. The need to look at end-to-end IP conversation, across any IP network type, between two business entities: a business resource provider and a business resource consumer (e.g., application and user, server and client); to quickly isolate problems to the server, application, or network and assign the right management team. An infrastructure view to pinpoint cloud issues such as peering, route, BGP, and MPLS problems. USNA needs delivery of detailed data about end-to-end application response time (broken down by server, network, and application performance and delay), network utilization, route composition and quality, and ISP/AS performance and utilization with a system of simply installed and easily managed appliances. The system must adapt automatically to changes in the application infrastructure so that data is always displayed in the context of its impact on the business, and its intelligent data aggregation algorithms making sure that the data with the most business value is always available; delivering a unified view of the network. This equipment and accessory products must allow managers to easily specify the logical structure of the application infrastructure, and based on this data it should automatically correlate and duplicate data from multiple sources to present a unified logical and physical view of the network. This includes a unique application service topology that enables managers to visualize and explore the flow of application services between business entities. Our local administrators need to be able to set policies and act on problems. In addition, the unified view of server, application, and network performance and utilization it delivers to both local and global managers encourages collaboration between different management "silos" (e.g., server, database, application, network, etc.). The result is radically simplified network troubleshooting, easier deployment of new applications and services, and reduced operating expenses. 
This requirement shall be a turnkey/integrated solution. Software, Hardware, Integration & Training shall be included in this proposal.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to solicit Yardney Technical Products, Inc., 82 Mechanic Street, Suite 2, Pawcatuck, CT 06379-9215 on a Sole Source basis for sixty-eight (68) each LR-190DC-1 Silver Zinc Cells with Fill Kits; forty-four (44) each LR-140DC-3 Silver Zinc Cells with Fill Kits; fifty-six(56) each LR-1890 Inter-cell Connectors; and thirty-two (32) each LR-140 Inter-cell Connectors. The program requires its battery cells to be able to provide enough energy density to power the system in excess of 10 hours and to provide a “wet” life (how long the cell will be usable after it is activated) in excess of 12 months. In the past, the program has purchased and used over 800 LR-190 and LR-140 cells from Yardney, BST and Eagle Pitcher. These cells were installed in numerous systems and tested extensively. In each case the Yardney battery cells have outperformed the other vendor’s cells in the “wet” life category. In fact, the Yardney cells have t! ypically provided a “wet” life in excess of 14 months. Because of the critical nature of the “wet” life requirement and the fact that the Yardney cells have consistently outperformed the other cells in this area, the Yardney Technical Products LR-190DC-1 and LR 140DC-3 Silver Zinc battery cells are to be procured with no substitutions. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 335912 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Aerospace Optics Incorporated, 3201 Sandy Lane, Fort Worth, Texas for the acquisition of operator interface components that are required for Carriage, Stream, and Recovery System (CSTRS) winch system.   The items being acquired are ten (10) drip/dust proof guards (p/n 17-143), ten (10) standby switches (p/n LED-48-55-KB-34828), ten (10) day/night switches (p/n LED-46-55-KB-34829), ten (10) tow select switches (p/nLED-45-51-MA-34830), ten (10) winch fault switches (p/n LED-45-51-SE-34831), fifty (50)  quick-connect plugs (p/n 18-200), 200 crimp socket pins (p/n 18-219), and ten (10) power switches (p/n LED-48-55-KB-34841).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  NSWCPC has been given the responsibility of redesigning the electrical enclosure used for winch operation. These items are the only LEDs that conform to the electrical a! nd mechanical requirements mandated by military standards. They will replace the existing switches used on the current MH60 winch electrical enclosure. These components are required to allow the operator to select key parameters that are critical to mission readiness and operation. AEROSPACE OPTICS is the only supplier for the VIVISUN mil-qualified, environmentally sealed LED displays with integral push button switches with custom text display legends. The LEDs are also Night Vision System (NVS) compliant. The above are all required for compatibility with the requirements for installation in the MH-60S aircraft. AEROSPACE OPTICS has the specific knowledge, processes, and equipment required to meet the MH-60S applications. It is in the government’s best interest to purchase the LED switches from AEROSPACE OPTICS, INC. NAICS: 334511 applies.  SBA Size Standard:  750.  FSC Code:  5960.

NUWCDIV Newport intends to place a Fixed Price sole source contract with TEGAM, Inc. for SYSIIA-26A Power Sensor calibrator, 10 MHz to 26.5 GHz, with delivery to Newport, RI by 30 SEP 2005.  The basis for the sole source is that TEGAM is the original equipment manufacture and propriety software was developed to ensure accurate calibration of RF sensors.  Any other vendor would have to make a significant amount of investment to develop the compatible hardware and software to meet the Navy requirements.  TEGAM is the only known source accredited by the Navy’s Metrology and Engineering Center to perform power calibration for the METCAL Program.  

The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 4214   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance, National Enforcement Investigations Center, intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to FLIR Systems Inc., N. Billerica, MA under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. BACKGROUND: The EPA has need of emerging technology which records the interaction of specific infra-red spectra with volatile organic constitutents creating the visual effect of "black smoke"  where fugitive emissions are present.  This infra-red thermography technology allows field personnel to visually scan a facility, which may contain hundreds of potentially leaking components, to identify components of interest.  The technology may also be utilized on a larger scale through the use  of aerial photography in remote areas.  Traditional air monitoring methods have excluded volatile organic sources such as underground pipelines and moving sources such as barges or railcars which could not be monitored in a real-time sense.  This technology will allow the real-time monitoring of  these important fugitive emission sources. FLIR Systems has developed the first infra-red camera imaging system of its kind which allows field personnel to see specific volatile organics in the form of "smoke" when viewed through the ThermaCAM GasFindIR.  This infra-red inspection system features  state-of-the-art, third generation, Indium Antimonide focal plane array.  The sensor delivers images of exceptional sensitivity, contrast and clarity.  Market Research was conducted and found only one source of this technology to currently exist.  REQUIREMENT: Two (2) state-of-the-art infra-red  cameras for use in identifying volatile organics; one 50 mm Lens; one 100 mm Lens; 24 month warranty (including parts and labor);  Training for 5 individuals.   Delivery Date within 8 weeks after receipt of order.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm  who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order  based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Debra A. Miller via email as miller.debbie@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the OPEX Corporation for the purchase of specialized high-volume incoming mail extracting equipment, specifically an OPEX model MPE 7.5 multiple purpose mail extractor with the following features: Milling Cutter, Outsource Bin, and Thick Stacker. This specialized mail extracting system is designed to automatically extract pre-qualified checks and documents from windowed and non-windowed envelopes for efficient document processing in high-volume environments. The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and determined that the OPEX MPE 7.5 multi-purpose mail extractor with the aforementioned features is the only device of its type that can meet the Government’s high-volume incoming mail extraction requirements, and that OPEX Corporation is the sole source for purchase of this specific equipment. In September 2004 SSA purchased two OPEX MPE 7.5 multipurpose mail extractors for the same facility. Any responsible firm that sells mail extraction machines capable meeting or exceeding the following minimum performance specifications: 1) input feed speed capability of 7500 pieces per hour; 2) parcel thickness detection; 3) parcel metal detection; 4) three-sided cutting capability with edge milling; 5) parcel extraction and extraction verification capability; 6) extraction and stacking of multi-document transactions; 7) extraction and stacking of three-piece transactions; 8) sortation capability that detects for metal and thickness for exception processing; 9) thick stacking capability that removes envelope contents for stacking (up to twelve differing paper thicknesses); 10) parcel content reuniting capability; 11) orienting capability that places checks and documents into appropriately oriented position; 12) Microsoft Windows compatibility; and 13) ability to handle both windowed and non-windowed envelopes, with different lengths and heights (length: 5.5 inches to 9.38 inches, height: 2.75 inches to 4.25 inches), may respond in writing no later than September 1, 2005 with a capability statement and information (including detailed technical equipment specifications) describing in FULL DETAIL their product’s ability to meet SSA's requirement. Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in providing machines of this type to other very high volume mail handling operations. Interested parties that feel they can provide these products may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to Andrew.Klimas@ssa.gov by September 1, 2005. All responses shall be marked “CAPABILITY STATEMENT-High Volume Mail Extracting Equipment”. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received by the cutoff date (September 1, 2005), the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with OPEX Corporation. Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<CONTACT>Larry Conger, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-544-1483, Email larry.conger@pco-iraq.net - Eric Bach, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-544-1407, Email eric.bach@pco-iraq.net
<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for work in and around the city of Baghdad, Iraq. The MATOC is a contract for execution of a broad range of 33kV down to 400V electrical distribution network construction projects. 

Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual projects to include: installation of 33kV underground feeder lines; installation of 11kV overhead and underground feeder lines; installation of new and rehabilitation of existing low voltage network systems to include installation of poles, conductors, and transformers. Description of the specific work to be accomplished will be identified in each individual Task Order. Individual Task Orders may range between an estimated $200,000 to $3,000,000. The program value is expected to be approximately $80,000,000 over a one-year period. 

Contractors shall complete all work under this contract in accordance with schedules that are established in each Task Order. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of electrical construction and renovation techniques. Submittal dates will be included in the individual Task Orders. These dates identify when information is due in the issuing Government office and other addresses identified in the individual Task Orders to where data may be submitted. The types and numbers of submittals and dates and places for review meetings shall be established by each Task Order under this contract.

This solicitation will incorporate a representative seed project upon which all proposals will be evaluated for award.  The seed project will be for all design, supply, construction, installation and commissioning activities necessary to provide a fully functional low voltage network for the residents of Malhalla 123 in the Keeylani area of the city of Baghdad, Iraq. In accordance with FAR 36.204 and DFARS 236.204, the Government estimates the magnitude of this construction effort to be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 (USD). The work for this project is expected to be completed within 160 days after issuance of Notice to Proceed.

The seed project will be awarded to the offeror whose offer is determined to be most advantageous to the Government for the first award.  Up to an additional six (6) awards may be made to offerors whose offers are also advantageous to the Government, based upon the stated evaluation criteria, in order to form the MATOC awardee group.  The Government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3). In using this best value approach, the Government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Government the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements, affordably. While the Government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective. This may result in an award being made to higher technically rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the solicitation and the source selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the price difference. 

All successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $3,500,000 over the life of the MATOC. The Government intends to compete future individual requirements among the MATOC awardees.  Offerors are encouraged to scrutinize the solicitation carefully when posted for more detailed information. 

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The solicitation for this effort is expected to be issued on or about 08 September 2005 and will be posted on our website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net/ .  Follow the links to “New Solicitations” and then “PCO Solicitations.”  Please submit any questions to TSgt Larry Conger larry.conger@pco-iraq.net or LCDR Eric Bach eric.bach@pco-iraq.net.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Clinical Cytogenetics Section (CCS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Applied Imaging Corporation, 120 Baytech Drive, San Jose, CA  95134 to upgrade the hardware and software of its Government owned CytoVision Workstation.  This upgrade will provide the speed, memory, resolution, and record storage capabilities critical to the performance of state-of-the-art diagnostic and research cytogenetics studies.  It will also be networked to the CCS’s other two Government owned CytoVision workstations, which is critical to their research.  Three missions of the CCS are: to provide state-of-the-art clinical cytogenetics diagnostic services to patients seen at the NIH Clinical Center; to perform high quality clinical and translational research in cancer cytogenetics; and to train students, residents, and fellows the basic principles and methods used in cytogenetics.  The CytoVision Workstation is used to perform three critical functions in the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory.  First is to provide high-resolution G-banded karyotype analysis which allows for the detection of numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities at the level of the light microscope.  Second, is fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technology which makes it possible to "see" submicroscopic chromosomal changes in both actively dividing (mitotic) and resting (interphase) cells. Last is comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which also uses FISH methodology, but has emerged as a powerful technology for investigating gains and losses of chromosomal material throughout the genome in non-dividing fresh or fixed tissue.  The contractor shall ensure all mechanical, electronic and software changes are fully compatible with the existing Government owned CytoVision workstations.  Applied Imaging Corporation is the only vendor qualified to make these upgrades to the Government owned CytoVision Workstation.  The upgrade must be compatible with the existing equipment and the only source known to the NCI researcher that can meet the aforementioned requirements is Applied Imaging Corporation. The Government’s intent is to upgrade one of its instruments, any capability statements offering a new instrument or that will not maintain the warranty and service plan of the Government owned Applied Imaging Corporation CytoVision Workstation will not be considered.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Early Detection Research Group (EDRG) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued consulting services of Dr. Anthony B. Miller, Box 992, Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, Canada, for a one year base period with one, one year option period.  The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial is a large-scale, randomized study to determine whether certain screening tests will reduce the number of deaths from these cancers. For prostate cancer, men have a digital rectal exam and a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). For lung cancer, men and women receive a chest x-ray. For colorectal cancer, men and women are screened with flexible sigmoidoscopy. For ovarian cancer, women have a blood test for the tumor marker known as CA-125, and transnational ultrasound. Together, prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers account for 48% of all cancers diagnosed and 49% of all cancer deaths in the United States each year. The tests being studied may detect these cancers before symptoms develop, but whether treatment at this stage will reduce the chance of dying from the diseases is unknown. Without a prospective randomized trial, it is difficult to determine to what extent an observed increase in survival with screening is a true benefit of early treatment, and to what extent it is an artificial effect (lead-time bias) of the extended interval between diagnosis and death introduced by screening. Uncertainty regarding the value of screening for the four PLCO cancers has resulted in conflicting positions in the medical community and confusion in the populations at risk. Because of the substantial infrastructure cost and effort required to mount a large-scale cancer screening trial, NCI determined that it would be most efficient and cost-effective to evaluate screening for all four PLCO cancers in a single trial. The contractor shall provide epidemiological services to the NCI Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. The Contractor shall 1) provide scientific expertise for the protocol projects;  2) provide guidance relating to the epidemiological and PLCO related studies that are supported by the EDRG;  3)  update the Project Officer to new advances in the mechanisms or strategies of early detection and screening, that may be relevant to DCP;  4) provide recommendations on the epidemiological aspects of planning for the future of EDRG as defined in the EDRG mission statement;  5)  attend meetings relating to the conduct of the PLCO Trial; 6) serve as Chair of the PLCO Behavior and Nutrition Subcommittee, serve as Chair of the PLCO Analysis, Cost-effectiveness, and Modeling Subcommittee and serve as Chair of the Endpoint Verification Committee (EVC); 7) provide recommendations on epidemological aspects of data analysis and modeling in the PLCO trial as discussed by the above committee which the contractor chairs; 8) develop recommendations for further data analysis and modeling approaches in the PLCO trial;  9) provide interpretation of the results of data analysis and modeling in the PLCO trial and participate as a contributing author or reviewer for any publications that may come from PLCO data that is deemed sufficiently mature;  10) provide recommendations on epidemiological aspects of HRQL and CE studies in the PLCO trial;  11) provide recommendations related to design of studies that will impact on assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL) and cost effectiveness (CE) studies in the PLCO trial;  12)  develop recommendations for further studies of HRQL and CE in the PLCO trial and shall provide his interpretation of results of the studies for HRQL and CE in the PLCO trial;  13)  shall provide recommendations for the pathology review in the PLCO trial;  14) attend meetings of the pathology review committee to provide guidance and recommendations on the protocol and procedures for the  pathology review;  15)  review decisions of the pathology review committee in order to identify and to provide recommendations in resolving difficulties in the application of pathology review criteria; and 16) review all Endpoint Verification folders (ACRIN and LSS) for completeness, the criteria for which will be established by the Government, and shall complete the Cause of Death Questionnaire (CDQ).  Dr. Miller is the only known source to the NCI researchers with this knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  
Dr. Miller developed the PLCO Death Data Review Protocol and the Pathology Review Protocol for PLCO and negotiated all aspects of these protocols with the Principal Investigators. He developed the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) endpoint verification protocol which is currently being used to determine the cause of death of NLST participants.  He analyzed the Quality of Life and Cost Effectiveness needs of the PLCO trial and directed the development of pilot projects to establish availability of data and suitability of analysis approaches.  Dr. Miller also participates in annual working meetings of IPSTEG as a representative of the PLCO.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on September  7, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch (RFMMB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Blackwell Publishing LTD, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford, United Kingdom to publish a 128 page special supplement issue entitled Conceptual Foundations in Tobacco-Related Health Disparities Research in the peer reviewed journal Addiction.  Although current smoking rates have declined in the United States, there are many US sub-populations that suffer disproportionately from the health effects of tobacco use. These disproportionate effects may be due to different patterns of tobacco use, initiation rates, and cessation behavior.  In 2005, NCI released the Eliminating Tobacco-Related Health Disparities, Summary Report, 2005. A critical conclusion of that report is that ‘Underlying the challenge to eliminate health disparities is the inadequate empirical understanding of the proximal and distal determinants of tobacco use, nicotine addiction, and related consequences among understudied and historically underserved populations in the United States’. This supplement will include papers designed to introduce and integrate diverse research areas and disciplines critical to health disparities research.  The interdisciplinary approach necessary for addressing tobacco-related health disparities will be demonstrated by the papers in this proposed journal supplement. The authors will emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the topic and give examples about how tools from various disciplines can help to address disparities research overall.  Multiple authors with diverse backgrounds will work together on each paper. Topics for the proposed papers include an overview of tobacco-related health disparities, life-cycle of tobacco use and nicotine addiction, prevention of tobacco-related health disparities, community readiness for research, communication inequality and tobacco-related health disparities, ethics, community capacity and infrastructure, SES measurement and biopsychosocial/gene-environment interactions.   Addiction will provide NCI with:  1) Peer reviews of the papers submitted for publication completed which will be completed by April 2006; 2)   Publication of special journal due 7 months after acceptance of papers and 1,500 copies; and 3) Free online access on the contractor’s website that NCI may link to from other pages.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC) seeks to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for overseas technical assistance and logistics support for the Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) worldwide objectives.  This anticipated competitive acquisition is a reissue of a previously cancelled solicitation under the same name.

SCOPE OF WORK:

The purpose of this IDIQ contract is to provide a variety of logistical support services for CLDP overseas initiatives.  The Contractor shall provide the following services:

1.  Logistic services and support for CLDP long term advisors living abroad.  The Contractor shall provide pre-departure and arrival briefings, temporary housing arrangements, furnish housing and moving assistance and other related support services.

2.  Administrative Support Services:  Logistic support for CLDP short term advisors and foreign nationals participating in CLDP programs both in the US and in other countries.  The Contractor may be required to provide local administrative support, professional services and office equipment. 

3.  Project and support for short-term mission personnel and foreign nationals.  This support may include airline reservations and ticket purchases, hotel accommodations, translators, interpreters, visa support, and other services as required.

4.  Establish and staff field offices and provide all of the administrative and technical assistance and logistics support to manage these offices for CLDP.     

5.  Logistical services for overseas conference support. 

BACKGROUND:

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is one component of the U.S. Government effort to support economic and political reforms underway around the globe.  CLDP provides training and consultative services to lawmakers, regulators, judges, lawyers and educators seeking assistance in the evaluation, revision and implementation of evolving legal systems.  Technical assistance is usually provided to designated countries through short-term and long-term U.S. experts (Advisors).  CLDP programs typically involve the placement of Advisors with host government ministries, as well as short-term in-country programs, such as conferences.

The incumbent contractor is Metrica, Inc., 10010 San Pedro, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78216.
CAPABILITIES: 

A prospective prime contractor must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in various countries.  CLDP has a presence in the following areas: Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  A critical component for the success of this program is contractor capability to obtain a line of credit ($1.5 M, and higher as program progresses) sufficient to finance required services and operations for approximately 90 days prior to contractor receipt of payment of monthly vouchers.  Also, the prime contractor must be fully capable to manage sub-contractors, and fund items and services as may be necessary or required during the contract term.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to publish a request for proposals for Full and Open Competition to negotiate a commercial contract for a series of technical assistance (TA) training programs focused on technical workshops on agricultural biotechnology for Chinese policymakers, regulators and scientists in both the United States and China.  

The proposed project will be presented under the auspices of the U.S.-China Biotechnology Working Group.  The past few years have shown that increased information exchanges between the United States and China about agricultural biotechnology issues and U.S. methods to handle the applied use of agricultural biotechnology products lead to more open and productive policy level discussions.  These dialogues have led to greater general acceptance by the Chinese government of agricultural biotechnology products, allowing U.S. agricultural exports to China to increase significantly.  However, various internal and external pressures on governments regarding agricultural biotechnology create an unpredictable environment for producers and traders of agricultural biotechnology products.  Due to this uncertain environment, recent increases in U.S. exports of agricultural biotechnology products with China are not assured to continue.

This proposed project would include both a long-term exchange program in the United States (to be administered by U.S. Department of Agriculture), and a series of short-term exchanges (in the United States and China) dealing with specific topics of concern regarding agricultural biotechnology (to be performed by the selected contractor).

The specific objectives of this project are (1) to exchange information with Chinese policymakers, regulators and scientists on specific topics of concern for the Chinese government regarding agricultural biotechnology products, (2) to use these information exchanges to keep the channels of communication between the United States and China open for future dialogue on agricultural biotechnology issues (such as the Biotechnology Working Group (BWG) policy dialogues), and (3) to encourage Chinese acceptance of agricultural biotechnology for the benefit of Chinese agriculture, U.S. trade, and global attitudes towards this topic.

To specifically meet these objectives, the Contractor shall facilitate and manage each training program, and make advisory and project preparation assistance available to the project sponsor in the area of agricultural biotechnology issues.
USTDA anticipates award of a single fixed price contract, at a ceiling price of NTE $480,000. 

The solicitation package will be available on or about the week of August 22, 2005. Once the RFP is issued, contractors will have 21 days in which to respond. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, and all questions and answers, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://www.eps.gov under the EPS for vendors option followed by selection of the U. S. Trade and Development Agency.  Potential vendors are responsible for accessing the website.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be distributed.  Accordingly, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored, and no bidders lists will be maintained.    

Potential offerors should direct all questions by email to contract@ustda.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command-Warren (TACOM-Warren) will be issuing a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) to FEV, Inc.  FEV developed an Opposed Piston Opposed Cylinder (OPOC) engine under DARPA contract MDA972-03-C- 0029 and has performed a feasibility study, to investigate if their OPOC engine can be modified for military ground vehicle applications. A preliminary component design effort was conducted under TARDEC NAC contract W56HZV-04-C-0028.  This action will incl ude the development of an OPOC engine concept design for ground vehicle combat application, based on the UAV OPOC engine.  The UAV OPOC engine requires modification to fulfill the requirements for the ground vehicle application.  The objective of this effo rt is to increase the power output from 170 kW to at least 240 kW for a single bank configuration.  In addition, the engine and its sub-systems, such as cooling, lubrication, air filtration and exhaust, require concept changes and the contractor will tailo r these to the Combat vehicle environmental requirements.  Furthermore, the contractor shall use CAE tools to support the concept development and verify the structural integrity of highly loaded components using FEA calculations.  This effort will require the contractor to use intensive thermal management calculations to optimize the concept of the cooling system.  The period of performance will be for eight (8) months.  This requirement will be solicited by letter.  Issuance of a formal solicitation is not  anticipated.  While this RFP is being issued on a sole source basis, any interested parties may request a copy of the letter RFP by sending an e-mail request to janet.joudas@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI)  in Blacksburg, Virginia, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for a gene expression study for th e Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  RNA samples from peripheral blood cells of normal volunteers infected with a Class A biowarfare agent (Francisella tularensis) will be sent to VBI to hybridize the RNA samples to array slides, to scan, to analyze the data, and to provide the findings of this gene expression study to WRAIR.  This study being conducted at WRAIR (in vitro study) is a part of a joint collaborative research project with employees of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious  Diseases (USAMRIID).  The results of the WRAIR study will be compared directly with the study being carried out at USAMRIID (in vivo study).  Due to the extreme sensitivity to technical issues and in order to keep such technical variations to a minimum, t he microarrray processing of the samples/slides will be processed by the same individuals at VBI for both sets of samples (from WRAIR and from USAMRIID). USAMRAA intends to award this requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price  type award is planned.  The period of performance is dependent on approval of the Human Use Protocol by the Headquarters, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Commands Investigative Review Board.  A total of 100 samples will be processed.  Delivery wi ll be scheduled after each sample is processed.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at F AX No. 301-619-3002 by 7 September 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  This procurement is made on the basis of full and open competition.  The identifying number is RFQ-OH-05-00172.  The NAICS code is 541620 and the size standard is $6 million.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  A firm, fixed price contract is  anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the project, "Liquid Introduction Design Criteria for Bioreactor Landfills" required by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, OH in accordance with the statement of work.  Title: Bioreactor  Landfill Design Guidance Period of Performance: 1 year from award date Bioreactor landfill technology in the US is rapidly changing.  The US EPA has undertaken the effort to evaluate this technology to insure its safe implementation.  To support this effort EPA/ORD is planning to develop  standardized design guidelines for bioreactor landfills.  Thus, providing guidance to the state regulators who are faced with increased permit requests as a result of the RD&D rule and can help set the stage for future federal regulations if the agency were so inclined to go in that direction.   The purpose of the task is to develop design guidelines for bioreactor landfills operating under EPA's bioreactor landfill research development and demonstration rule or any other applicable state or federal regulations.  Liquids addition design, Liquids collection and waste stability design in  particular need to be addressed in the final report of this project. 1. Identification of liquid addition system design alternatives:  Gathering all current information available pertaining to the different types of liquids addition systems for landfills; Source liquids; Leachate storage 2.  Development of design guidelines for liquids addition amounts:  This step will evaluate the requirements for moisture addition to landfills. 3. Development of design guidelines for liquids addition rates:  This step will evaluate the considerations that go into deciding the rate that liquids should  be added to the landfill.  Many factors go into deciding the rate of liquid addition, including available liquids supply, leachate collection system issues, gas collection issues, and ability of the landfill to accept the liquids;  Evaluate liquids addition rates from a broad perspective, not from  the perspective of a particular liquids addition technology. 4. Development of design guidelines for sizing, spacing, construction and operation of individual liquids addition systems:  The liquids addition systems to be reviewed will include (at a minimum) buried horizontal trenches, vertical  wells, surface area sources (e.g., ponds, drip irrigation), buried area sources, and surface trenches;  Fundamental principles of saturated-unsaturated flow will be used to develop analytical predictive equations for moisture movement as a function of flow rate, pressure and waste characteristics  (e.g., isotropy, permeability);  Where analytical relationships are limited, numerical modeling will be conducted to develop design relationships. 5.  Leachate collection system design and consideration for handling the increase in flow:  The USE of EPA HELP model for head on the liner  calculations. 6. Solid waste stability:  Solid Waste Settlement modeling;  Side slope stability and pore water pressure relationships Task	Due	Description	Deliverables Task 1:  1 week after award Project kickoff meeting finalizing design parameters to be examined particularly liquid addition and  leachate collection	N/A Task 2: 2 weeks after award QA Plan Submitted to EPA	Draft QA Project Plan (QAPP) Task 3: After QAPP Approved by EPA, Begin work on the deign document	 Task 4: 8 weeks after award, Follow up meeting	 Task 5: 16 weeks after award, Prepare and submit draft report outlining  liquid types and addition rates.Draft 1st report Task 6: 4 months after award, Follow up meeting	 Task 7: 6 months after award,	Draft report on design guidelines for sizing, spacing, construction and operation of individual liquids addition systems, Draft 2nd report Task 8: 8 months after, Draft  report on Leachate collection system design and consideration for handling the increase in flow Draft 3rd report Task 9:10 months, Draft report on bioreactor landfill slope stability issues,  Draft 4th report Task 10: 12 months, Final Report due, Final Report Quality Assurance and Data Quality:  This effort involves the examination of available data generated by others.

The grantee is the Government of Nigeria, through the Office of the Presidential Advisor in Petroleum and Energy Matters.

The Technical Assistance Project proposed here is a complex project.  It essentially consists of the following:

·	A review of current LPG infrastructure and market situation and the establishment of working relationships with the Government of Nigeria, relevant National Assembly Committees, and industry.
·	A review of legislative and regulatory shortcomings in the market and the development of remedial regulatory steps designed to return order to the market.  Design of a functioning regulatory regime for LPG, ready for immediate implementation.
·	An assessment of the reserves and productive capacity of marginal oil and gas fields in the Niger Delta Region as a new source for LPG. Projection of volumes and sequencing of newly developed oil and gas streams.
·	An analysis of the existing LPG distribution and storage facilities and the construction of a new depot near Abuja, development of financial documentation required to sell storage depots to private investors and an aggressive promotional program to effect the rapid sale of the depots.
·	A review of current safety problems related to LPG cylinders and the development and implementation of concrete recommendations and practical steps to restore safety and public acceptance in marketing LPG in portable cylinders.
·	A broad-brushed impact statement discussing the task-specific developmental and environmental consequences of the marketing structure, supply, distribution and storage, and LP Gas cylinder activities described above, plus an overall assessment of the consequences of the transition of large parts of the Nigerian economy from wood to LPG as a household fuel.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $562,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services is to respond to a question that has been raised. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

Question 1: Can we obtain more information on the block upgrade to Oracle 10g and Solaris 10?

Response: The Force Readiness mission application is a "system within a system" (or is a member of a "family of systems") that provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with its command and control capability. This overarching command and control capability is call Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J). Force Readiness is but one of many mission applications that reside under the GCCS-J "umbrella." The GCCS-J establishes the common operating environment upon which all mission applications must reside. As stated previously, Force Readiness is the authoritative system-of-record database for tracking the status (quality and quantity) of all equipment and personnel assigned to a formal UIC. In Block V, the GCCS-J Common Operating Environment will include Solaris 10 and Oracle 10g. The Force Readiness mission application (consisting of the input tool, output tool, and database) must be able to reside upon this foundational common operating environment.

<CONTACT>Leisa Bodway, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-1278, Fax 410-786-9643, Email LBodway@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>There are two amendments to this synopsis. One, the solicitation for this requirement will be a cost type contract not fixed-priced. Second, the solicitation will be under the NAICS code of 518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and not 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. ----------------------Description:
CMS intends to award a 23-month cost-type contract, with no options, to a small business to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid Error Rate (MER) project.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  
BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  
The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.
To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 4, 2005); (2) a documentation/database contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 10, 2005); and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from states; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the documentation/database contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will use the policies and medical records obtained by the documentation/database contractor to perform the medical reviews, provide findings to the statistical contractor, jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor and submit the report to CMS.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful offeror, as the review contractor, shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The review contractor shall review each sampling unit to determine if was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The review contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  The review contractor shall conduct the data processing reviews on-site for each state selected, visiting each state between two and five times.  The medical reviews may be performed at a central location.
The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit, a hospital stay, a month of enrollment in Medicare).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. It is estimated that between 800 – 1200 sampling units or an average of 1000, per state, will need to be reviewed to achieve 3% precision at the 95% confidence level. The contractor shall perform this work for one complete production, December 31, 2005, through November 30, 2007.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal late August 2005 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to update section G.3 entitled Invoice Instructions and to respond to vendor questions.

G.3 Invoice Instructions
a. The Contractor shall submit only one invoice for each task.  Invoice shall be submitted within 30 days of completion of each task. In certain circumstances, where a task order project may extend for a period of more than 90 days, the contractor may submit invoices monthly with consent from the Contracting Officer or Ordering Official.  The Contractor shall submit accurate and complete invoices that include one copy of receipts for all expenditures and subcontractor costs.  If the Contractor is unable to gather all the receipts for expenditures and subcontractor costs within this 30-day timeframe, the Contractor shall report to the COTR the outstanding balance and reason for the delay. The Contractor shall submit one original invoice, one invoice copy, and another invoice copy that includes the back-up documentation to verify expenditures. Invoices shall be formatted in accordance with the invoice sample provided in Attachment A.  Contractor should note that payment for each invoice may take up to 30 days from the approval date of the invoice.

Gaithersburg, MD  20899

Responses to Vendor Questions

Question 1:  The original RFP limited the Technical Volume to 20 pages. This limitation was not stated in the updated RFP. Does this mean that there are now no page limits? The previous Section L also included other requirements such as double spaced text, etc. which are not included in the June 13 update. 

Answer 1:  See amendment 3 to the solicitation.

Question 2:  Will DoC accept contract references where work was performed as a subcontractor to a U.S. Government Prime Contractor?

Answer 2:  Yes, see solicitation page 32, Section L5(b)(2)(B)(2)(a)

Question 3:  Section G, Paragraph b requires proof that at least three estimates were obtained for all ODCs in order for them to be reimbursed. Will exceptions be made in situations where materials must be procured in-country and there may only be a single vendor or supplier? Does this requirement also apply to travel (airfare, lodging, etc.)?

Answer 3:  See solicitation amendment 4.  The Contractor must demonstrate maximum practicable competition for each Other Direct Cost (ODC).

Question 4:  What is the approximate split between interpretation hours in the U.S. vs. overseas locations?

Answer 4:  Most of the interpretation will be done overseas.  DOC offices typically use the Department of State for translating here in the U.S.  

Question 5:  What is the purpose of the “English Interpreter”? We consider this to mean a native English speaker who interprets primarily from a foreign language to English. If this is the intent, what specific languages will requ

BACKGROUND:

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is one component of the U.S. Government effort to support economic and political reforms underway around the globe.  CLDP provides training and consultative services to lawmakers, regulators, judges, lawyers and educators seeking assistance in the evaluation, revision and implementation of evolving legal systems.  Technical assistance is usually provided to designated countries through short-term and long-term U.S. experts (Advisors).  CLDP programs typically involve the placement of Advisors with host government ministries, as well as short-term in-country programs, such as conferences.

The incumbent contractor is Metrica, Inc., 10010 San Pedro, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78216.
CAPABILITIES: 

A prospective prime contractor must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in various countries.  CLDP has a presence in the following areas: Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  A critical component for the success of this program is contractor capability to obtain a line of credit ($1.5 M, and higher as program progresses) sufficient to finance required services and operations for approximately 90 days prior to contractor receipt of payment of monthly vouchers.  Also, the prime contractor must be fully capable to manage sub-contractors, and fund items and services as may be necessary or required during the contract term.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado – Boulder, Physics Department, to perform experimental and theoretical research in the field of quantum information processing.  The research associate will perform experimental and theoretical studies to realize quantum information processing protocols in a multi-zone ion trap structure.  Principal Investigator will be Dr. Neil Ashby.  Over the past few years, NIST has initiated a program in quantum information processing.  The Ion Storage Group of the Time and Frequency division has demonstrated all of the basic elements of quantum computation with the system of trapped atomic ions.  The development of quantum computers has become a national priority, because if one can be built, it would enable efficient decryption of data that has been encoded using a method that has been commonly used for the last 20 years.  Based upon close contact with all groups throughout the world that perform this type of work, the Ion-Storage group believes that Dr. Ashby and his colleagues are unique in  the specific aspects needed for the proposed study.  They have extensive experience in the field of quantum information processing using trapped ions.  Further, the NIST facilities in Boulder are world-class and could not be duplicated elsewhere in a reasonable time or at a reasonable cost.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Award date will be September 8, 2005.

<DESC>The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, experience, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Performance Based Logisti cs (PBL) Program.   IAW  AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced  logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.    Under this PBL contract, the contractor will be responsible for a large portion of the worldwide tactical vehicle fleet logistics support, such as supply chain management and all scheduled and unscheduled Sustainment level maintenance.  The contractor will  be responsible for the scheduled Preventative Maintenance Checks & Service (PMCS) at the field level, with the exception of any operator level daily, weekly or monthly checks.  The focus of this PMCS effort will be semi-annual and annual services and lubr ications.   The Army will retain responsibility for the unscheduled field maintenance of tactical vehicles.  Contractor will be responsible for executing a complete Total Package Fielding of all new production, Reset and/or RECAP vehicles.  Operator and ma intenance training to include both new equipment training and sustainment training will be the contractors responsibility.  Contractors will be required to produce a Training Program which can be executable by Army Field units as a stand alone NET and/or S ustainment Training package.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve  performance and reliability.  We expect that the OEMs will have to be partnered with the overall Product Support Integrator (PSI) in order to take full advantage of the reliability vs. support cost incentives. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price long-term contract.  Length to be determined.   Goal: Ultimate goal is ultra-reliability.  Our goal is to structure a contract, which will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  Operational readiness 98% or better.  Enhanced Logistics response times.  Enhanced deployment.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times.  Reduced Logistics costs.  Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Operational Readiness -  Standard Army readiness reporting will be used to the maximum extent possible.  Also, we will measure mission start and completion performance.  (Vehicle starts and completes mission XX% of time)  Logistics Response Time  The period of time from when a failure/malfunction is detected and validated by the maintainer to the time the failure/malfunction has been resolved.  This includes all related time to order, ship and deliver parts and perform mai ntenance.  Reduced Logistics Footprint  Measurable reduction in number of tools reqd  (special and common).  Measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair   and troubleshooting tasks. Measurable reduction of training required.  Measurable increase in fuel economy.  Any other reduction in the size or presence of losistics support required to deploy, sustain and move the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleet. Cost per Mile  Total Operating Costs divided b y the total number of miles driven. PBL System Candidates: See Appendix B* for profile of potential PBL Systems. Systems to be supported under this PBL Program are vehicle systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and reset/recap systems.   These profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Optempo and specific details necessary to det ermine level of work required to perform the support operations. * Appendix B is For Official Use Only and will be provided separately by request to the P.O.C. identified below. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE 1.   Name of Firm       Address       City, State, Zip Code       Point of Contact Name       Telephone Number       Email Address       Website Address 2.  What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the tactical vehicle fleet? 3.  How would you propose meeting the goal of ultra-reliability? 4.  What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 5.  Do you have any further suggestions, beyond those listed in the Proposed Measurements paragraph above, for measuring performance of the PBL, particularly supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?   6.  What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the vehicle fleets? 7.  How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce vehicle maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 8.  How would you approach operator/maintainer training and reduce training needs? 9.  How would you approach performance of all scheduled services at the Field level? 10. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract?    What length of contract would you need in order to make this a viable proposition? 11. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? 12.  How would you envision the measurement of cost per mile? Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be sent via email to grguricc@tacom.army.mil.  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire. Any product literature that cannot be emailed may be sent to: 	U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command 	Attn: SFAE-CSS-TV-S (C. Grgurich), M/S 500 	6501 E. Eleven Mile Rd.

We appreciate your cooperation in answering these questions and thank you in advance for your participation.   DEFINITIONS APPENDIX A Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes)., and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated  Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP  is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to negotiate Performance Based Agreements (PB A) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. Two Level Maintenance:  Latest Army concept for maintenance, which transforms the current 4-level maintenance system to a more flexible two-level system, one which is focused on on-system repair, the other focused on off-system repairs.  The goal is a simp lified structure that provides reduced cycle time with greater efficiency in all maintenance processes. Field Maintenance:  Focused on returning a weapon system to an operational status by fault isolating and replacing the failed component, assembly or module of the weapon system.  Usually consists of operator, organizational and selected direct support task s from the old 4-level maintenance system. Sustainment Maintenance:   Focused on repairing components, assemblies, modules and end items, generally characterized as off-system and repair rear.  The intent of Sustainment Maintenance is to perform commodity-oriented repairs on all supported items  to one standard that provides a consistent and measurable level of reliability.  Sustainment Training:  That training necessary to maintain requisite skills within both Field and Sustainment units to continue efficient, high-quality performance of necessary repairs and maintenance for assigned equipment, considering periodic personnel rotations/reassignments.  This is also commonly referred to as refresher training and will also include operator training.  New Equipment Training:  The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/contractor to the trainer, user and supporter.  It represents that knowled ge that is needed for operation, maintenance and logistic support during testing and initial introduction of new materiel into the Army inventory.  Reliability:  The ability of a system and its parts to perform its mission without failure, degradation or demand on the support system.  Ultra-Reliability  is maximized system reliability, which thereby reduces maintenance, spare parts and training requi rements in the process. Recapitalization (recap):  The complete rebuild and select upgrade of currently fielded systems to a like-new condition, zero time/zero miles.  The objectives of the RECAP process include:  extending service life, reducing operating and support costs, enha ncing capability and improving system reliability, maintainability, safety, and efficiency.     RESET:   A series of actions to restore and reconfigure units to a desired level of combat capability (commensurate with mission requirements and availability of resources) after returning from contingency operations.  These actions consist of cleaning, in specting and repairing equipment, and as well as replacing battle losses, washed out and obsolete equipment.  Work is conducted IAW applicable Army maintenance standards(10/20) and aviation Special Technical Inspection and Repair Standards (STIR). Total Package Fielding (TPF):  Total package fielding is the Armys standard materiel fielding process for new or modified materiel systems. The TPF process is designed to provide a consolidated support package of equipment and materiel to the using units.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Agency  Northern Region, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah Directorate of Contracting (hereinafter referred to as the Government) seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to providing for the transportati on and distribution of natural gas from a qualified Natural Gas Transportation Provider.  Interested contractors will be required under their own efforts and cost provide a natural gas pipeline to the boundary of the Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) installatio n and from that point provide, via approved routing, an internal distribution system to deliver natural gas to a point of entry into each building on the installation.  A contractor will be required to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the complete installation of the gas lines and provide operation, maintenance, repairs, and scheduled replacements to this system to keep it in a safe condition and in compliance with all state and federal regulations throughout the life of any resultant contract. These services will be provided in accordance with all terms, conditions, and special contract requirements, specifications, attachments, and drawings c ontained in or incorporated by reference in any future solicitation.  The DPG facility is currently meeting the heating demands with approximately one million gallons of fuel oil and half a million gallons of propane.  It is anticipated that the natural ga s consumption would replace the current heating process.  Recuperation of investment costs will be by a firm-fixed monthly Connection Fee that will consist of the total cost of capitalization, including overhead, profit, and financing divided by a 240 mont h payback period.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for operation and maintenance of the natural gas transportation and distribution works to include but not limited to the monthly meter reading, emergency repairs, blue stake operations, calibratio ns, and scheduled replacements as well as administration, coordination, and monthly billing.  The operation and maintenance will consist of the anticipated average monthly cost for performing these functions.  PROCEDURES:  This request for information is a  required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties in order to minimize cost both to potentially interested parties and the Government.  This notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceedin g with a formal request for proposals.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for this action, it is highly unlikely that a formal solicitation will be issued. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal request for proposals may be fo rthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length) to:  U.S. Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Attn: SFCA-NR-DW (Eric S. Vokt, Contracting Officer), Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah 84022.  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria: (1) capability and experience in the construction, ownership, operation, and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to construct, expand, and operate a natural gas sys tem; (3) a statement showing an understanding of the obligation to provide continuous utility services; (4) understanding of any applicable federal, state, and local utility laws, regulations or franchise requirements affecting utilities in the State of Ut ah and capability of complying with such requirements (It should be noted that DPG is principally an area of concurrent State and Federal jurisdiction); and (5) understanding of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity a nd experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the Statement of Utah and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8.  Elaborate proposals or pricing information are neither required nor desired.  Any innovative and new conceptual ideas to achieve the stated objective are encouraged. No solicitation document exists for this request for Sources Sought.  This notice is for informati onal purposes only; it is not a request for proposals nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended into responding to this sources sought announcement.  Responses must be submitted not la ter that 5:00 PM MST, 8 September 2005 via email (eric.s.vokt@us.army.mil) or facsimile (435-831-2103 or 435-831-2085).

<SUBJECT>Q -- Market Research for Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) Services
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON A DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK AS PART OF MARKET RESEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE FUTURE TRICARE CONTRACT AS A FOLLOW-ON TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SPECIAL NOTICE #05-128. 

The Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is in the initial stage of developing future requirements for dental insurance carriers to provide dental services, including the processing and payment of dental claims, for Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) residing within the United States and some of its territories under the Active Duty Dental Program.  As part of its market research, the Government is seeking industry input with regards to its draft statement of work (SOW) which may be found under “Market Survey” Special Notice, Reference Number 05-ADDP on the TRICARE Website at http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/healthcare/index.cfm
  Comments are solicited as to whether the language included in the draft SOW is sufficiently descriptive/detailed and broad enough in scope, includes applicable and necessary standard industry/commercial practices, and establishes reasonable objectives and obtainable standards that can be measured and used in conjunction with possible performance incentives. Comments/suggestions on additional aspects of the draft SOW are encouraged and may also be submitted. All comments/suggestions made should be stated in generic/broad and nonproprietary terms.  A summary of the Government’s needs are basically as follows:  A potential offeror must tender its current nation-wide dental network of credentialed providers to the Program and its most favorable network fee schedule or discounts; however, in remote locations, claims from non-network providers will be submitted for payment. Certain claims are required to be preauthorized by Government personnel prior to payment.  The dental benefit structure will be a full-spectrum of possible dental procedures; however, the contractor will pay claims based solely on the specified procedures in the authorizations above a dollar threshold and will make no benefit determinations.  Please submit your comments to Mr. Graham Kolb at TRICARE Management Activity, 16401 East Centretech Parkway, Aurora, CO 80011-9066, or by e-mail at james.kolb@tma.osd.mil.  We will consider your comments whenever received; however, as we plan to make decisions within the next 30 days, we request your comments as soon as possible. The government will not be publishing or responding in a public forum to any comments or questions as part of this market research.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>SAP083-000HCN72-2005-24111
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to the Carolinas Poision Control Center, 5000 Airport Center Parkway, Suite B, Charlotte, NC 28208. The Carolinas Poison Control Center will be required to conduct a mock chemical terrorism exercise and provide a written evaluation of the national toxicosurveillance system. The CDC’s Health Studies Branch is currently seeking to outsource the evaluation and testing of the national toxicosurvellance program that is currently administered by the American Association of Poision Control Centers (AAPCC).  It has been determined that the Carolinas Poison Control Center possessed a greater level of experience with toxicosurveillance at the state and regional levels, thus they are the only firm capable of conducting an exercise of this magnitude in a timely, efficient and cost effective manner. These findings were based on the fact that Carolinas Poision Control Center has been actively collecting data and conducting surveillance of poison control activities since 2003, thus developed case definitions and syndromes required for the evaluation of the toxicosurveillance program at a national level. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide this service must provide evidance of an established local toxicosurveillance program, as well as, the capabiltiy to immediately test and evaluate a toxicosurveillance program at a national level in an efficient and effective manner. Firms that believe they are fully qualified to provide this service are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Russell Oxford by e-mail at efn3@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.

<SUBJECT>B -- Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), intends to, using simplified acquisition procedures, negotiate with the University of California at Davis, Wildlife Health Center, Davis, California.  The University of California at Davis, Wildlife Health Center is uniquely qualified to develop research and response plans for investigating the role of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in marine mammal mortality for bottlenose dolphins unusual mortality events (UME) that have occurred along the Florida Panhandle.  The University of California at Davis, Wildlife Health Center has published peer reviewed reports and protocols on the subject of marine mammal epidemiology and risk assessment.  Stranding response protocols for killer whale diagnostics and necropsies that the NOAA, NMFS used were developed by the University of California at Davis, Wildlife Health Center.  This requirement will be procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-5.  The Title IV of the Marine Mammal Protection Act mandates NMFS’ Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP) to coordinate and oversee investigations into Marine Mammal in an effort to conserve and protect marine mammal populations, and to understand ocean and human health concerns.  The MMHSRP has been leading the investigations into two significant UMEs involving bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the Florida Panhandle that occurred in 1999-2000 and again in 2004 in which over 200 dolphins died.  The government anticipates that the research and response plans will result in its improved ability to respond to, and to investigate, future marine mammal mortality events.  For the above reasons it would be untimely and too costly for any other organizations to provide the unique services of this requirement.  An 18-month purchase order is planned.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

This would result in significant loss of time, money and scientific research already expended for this pr oject.  This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, statements of capability to fulfill this requirement received from other responsible business prior to close of business 26 August 2005 will be evaluated.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

After three years of negotiations, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), the main rebel group in Southern Sudan, signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9, 2005 to end more than 21 years of civil war.  However, as Khartoum makes peace on one front, violent conflict persists in another in Western Sudan.

Open warfare erupted in the Darfur region of Sudan in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked GOS military installations.  The rebels, who seek an end to the region's chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias, or Jingaweit, recruited among groups of Arabic extraction.  Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings and massive displacement.

The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the highest degree.  According to the United Nations (UN) Humanitarian Profile Number Nine of December 1, 2004, an estimated 2.4 million inhabitants of a total population of 6.5 million have been displaced within and from the Darfur region, including more than 200,000 who have crossed the country's border into neighboring Chad.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).
The Humanitarian Protection and IDP Field Officer will be a part of the OFDA Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) in the Darfur Region of Sudan.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Humanitarian Protection and IDP Field Officer for the Darfur DART in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will provide a critical on-the-ground link to implementing partners and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The Humanitarian Protection and IDP Field Officer will be assigned by OFDA to the DART in Sudan for a period of 11 months.  The incumbent will travel extensively, spending the majority of his/her time in the capitol city of Khartoum and throughout the three provinces of Darfur.  The incumbent will work without direct supervision for extended periods of time.  Deployments to Darfur will be in increments of three months, which may include details to Washington, DC to brief USAID staff, other USG agencies, Congressional members and committees and/or partner organizations on the DART's activities.  Time between deployments will be charged to earned annual leave or leave without pay.

General Responsibilities

The Humanitarian Protection and IDP Field Officer's main role will be to provide expert advice to the DART and others on humanitarian protection matters, analyze and report on trends, and monitor the impact of protection in humanitarian programming.  The incumbent will:

* Assess continually the situation of IDPs and other vulnerable groups and develop or contribute to the development of appropriate programmatic responses; 
* Participate actively in relevant working groups and contribute to the development of tools to address humanitarian protection issues such as forced return;
* Collect and analyze region-wide data to identify humanitarian protection trends and major concerns and draft cables and other reports;
* Monitor the work of OFDA-funded UN organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IOs) and other donors to ensure that humanitarian protection needs are met;
* Participate with key DART members in setting priorities and implementing policies;
* Identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements of affected populations including target groups, their locations and existing relief programs and make recommendations for the types of humanitarian protection interventions that may be necessary;
* Maintain daily liaison with UN organizations, NGOs, PVOs, IOs, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other organizations regarding humanitarian protection activities;
* Perform a technical assistance role on DARTs and/or perform field assessments in disasters, recommending appropriate interventions and establishing appropriate priorities;
* Operate DART communications equipment and operate a 4-wheel drive, standard-shift vehicle in cross-country conditions;
* Adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines, coordinating all travel with the DART Leader, the DART Security Officer, the USAID Executive Officer (EXO) and the Washington-based Response Management Team (RMT).

Specific Responsibilities

* Provide guidance to UN organizations, NGOs, PVOs and IOs regarding OFDA guidelines for submitting grant proposals, review submitted proposals and make recommendations to the DART Senior Program Officer (SPO);
* Submit situation reports and assessment reports on a minimum monthly basis, or more frequently as specified by the DART Leader;
* Submit an end-of-tour report within 10 days of the end of the contract period of performance.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP

The Humanitarian Protection and IDP Field Officer will report directly to the DART Leader or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in responding to humanitarian protection needs as part of the DART.  The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number GED-RFQ-5235, this is a small business set-aside, NAICS 334611 Standard size 500.  

	Item 1 – Decision Tree Software - The U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development, National Health and Environmental Effect Research Laboratory, Gulf Ecology Division (GED) is currently seeking to purchase 2 named software licenses or 1 multi-user software license for developing tools (models) to assess and diagnose impairment in aquatic systems and the sources of associated stressors.  Our research specifically addresses: 1) the development of methods and tools to enable states to monitor the condition of all waters and to predict the location of impaired waters; and 2) increasing our understanding of source/stressor and stressor/response relationships.
	
	Using principles of the Stressor Identification (SI) process supporting EPA’s guidance to assist the States in identifying causes of biological impairment, GED intends to develop the tools to diagnose the cause(s) of impairment from multiple stressors in coastal estuarine systems.  Research includes the use of vast quantities of environmental data generated by GED-based projects, multiple EPA eco-divisions, and other federal and states agencies.  GED scientists have determined that the best method for developing these models/tools will include the need to develop decision- or regression-trees for interpreting large, complex sets of environmental data. This type of software will allow us to thoroughly evaluate associations between varying types of data and pose well founded and comprehensive predictive models for determining the probability and source of estuarine resource impairment.
	
	Definitions:
	
•	All references to the term “software” from this point forward shall be defined as “classification and regression tree software”.

Requirements:
	
1. The software shall use statistically sound and scientifically rigorous regression algorithms for generating decision models employing the methods described by Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R. A., and Stone, C.J. 1983. Classification and Regression Trees. Wadsworth. 

2. The software shall generate scientific and/or environmental data-driven regression models for building classification trees using target variable(s) that maybe:
a.	Continuous
b.	Discrete (categorical)
c.	Numeric or character
d.	Fractional

3.	The software shall  display, at a minimum, the following functions/features:
a.	Acquire data from ASCII-delimited formatted and database (including MSAccess and Oracle) resident sources.
b.	Provide model export options compatible with Microsoft Excel® and SAS®
c.	Maintain and report summary information about continuous statistics (mean, n, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc.).
d.	Maintain and report fully-weighed tabulation of distinct variables along with the quartile information and frequencies.
e.	Use entropy splitting rule relative to common levels
f.	Automatically use surrogate “splitting-variables” where values are missing (intelligent substitution)
g.	Generates the maximum number of node branches then optimizes the tree structure based on statistical importance.
h.	Determine the statistical importance of a variable and integrate the outcome across all of the tree splits.
i.	Use single variable splitting criteria - Gini, symmetric Gini, twoing, ordered twoing and class probability for classification trees.
j.	Use squares and least absolute deviation for regression trees.
k.	Execute automatic self validation procedures for model applicability (truthing) using relevant data from outside the development and training mode. 
l.	Produce publication ready graphics.

4.	The software shall be able to minimally accommodate a data matrix (array) containing a sample size of 25000 with ~ 200 variables.

5.	The software must be able to provide a stable computing environment for manipulating large quantities of data without fatal application errors and using the standard,  EPA-configured computing platform:
a.	Windows XP Profession Operating System Version 2002 Service Pack 1

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The request for proposal number is N62645-05-R-0039.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05 are incorporated.  NAICS 325413/SIC 2835.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for immunoassay reagent for oxycodone / oxymorphone for use in the DoD Military Drug Testing Laboratories.  The resulting contract will be a requirements type contract with a base year (CLIN 0001) and four option years (CLINS 0002-0005).  The estimated number of tests per year is 1.0 million.  1.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IMMUNOASSAY TEST REAGENT FOR OXYCODONE / OXYMORPHONE. 1.1.  Scope.  The materials shall be for the immunoassay of oxycodone / oxymorphone in urine and are to provide immunological reagent for initial (screen) testing.  The reagent must be compatible for use with the Roche (Modular "D" and "P") automated drug-screening equipment, and must be applicable without modification of the equipment.  The reagent must be compatible with the optimal throughput of the instrument being used to perform the assay in the military laboratory.  1.2.  Sensitivity and Specificity.  When using oxycodone at a calibration cutoff concentration of 100 ng/ml, the testing reagent must detect 95% of all QC specimens containing the screening drugs oxycodone or oxymorphone at individual concentrations equal to or greater than 125% (125 ng/ml) of the cutoff concentration (100 ng/ml) of the initial immunoassay test.  The testing reagent must be specific for the presence of oxycodone / oxymorphone such that no less than 80% of the actual specimen submission identified as positive will confirm positive for oxycodone or oxymorphone by GC/MS at the individual drug confirmation cutoff of 100 ng/ml.  It is desirable that the reagent has equivalent sensitivity to the presence of oxycodone or oxymorphone when present at individual drug concentrations of 100 ng/ml.  1.3.  Compliance with Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Requirements. 1.3.1.  Immunoassay kits are medical devices and must have clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be marketed.  The registration and listing process specified by the FDA must be followed and the manufacturer must adhere to good manufacturing processes (GMP) in the manufacture of the devices.  Any mandatory recalls of the kits provided under this contract and any other problems that require notification to the FDA must be resolved as required by the FDA regulations current at the time.  The contractor shall notify the contracting officer of any recall or FDA notification within two working days of the event.  1.3.2.  Except as provided herein, the reagents supplied throughout the term of this contract shall be identical to the reagents offered by the contractor and accepted by the Government at the time of the contract award.  If, during the course of this contract, the manufacturer wishes to change or improve its kit, that product modification must be proposed in writing to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to its incorporation into the kits to be delivered.  The contractor's proposal must include documentation that demonstrates that the manufacturer has complied with all applicable FDA regulations, including those concerning the filing of a new 510k notice if such action and subsequent FDA clearance are warranted by the nature of the modification.  1.4.  Packaging. The materials provided must be in volumes and packaging that are convenient and applicable to the throughput of the military laboratories and should not result in the loss or unnecessary disposal of significant volumes of reagent.  The contractor will not be required to provide calibrators and control materials for the drug reagents.  (The military laboratories will separately obtain or provide calibrators and control materials to be used with the reagents.)  The materials must be provided with an instruction sheet that complies with all requirements of the FDA and includes data demonstrating specific performance characteristics, such as, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, cross reactivity, and safety precautions.  The instruction sheet(s) shall include procedures optimized for military drug testing laboratory operations as represented in these specifications and cutoffs as utilized by the DoD.  The Government will not develop procedures or optimize the performance of a kit for the contractor.  1.5.  Shelf life.  Minimum shelf life of any unopened component of the assay shall be at least 180 days from date of delivery at the drug-testing laboratory.  Once kit container seals are broken and the component opened, the shelf life must be at least 14 days.  Once diluted the material must have a shelf life of 24 hours.  2.  TESTING and QUALITY CONTROL PROTOCOL.  The following testing and quality control protocol will be used for all military testing.  The reagents supplied must be adaptable to the calibration requirements and characteristics of the Roche (Modular "D" and "P") high-speed automated analyzer.  Verification of each calibration using oxycodone at 100 ng/ml will be accomplished with a drug free control, a control at 75% of oxycodone cutoff concentration, a control at 125% of oxycodone cutoff concentration and a control at 200% of oxycodone cutoff concentration.  An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free < 75% < cutoff < 125% < 200% controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens. The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in number 3. using this testing protocol.  3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF REAGENTS.  3.1.  Oxycodone / Oxymorphone Sensitivity. The initial immunoassay test cutoff concentration shall be 100 ng/mL of oxycodone / oxymorphone.   The reagent shall identify specimens containing oxycodone / oxymorphone when either of the compounds is present at or above the cutoff concentration of 100 ng/ml.

The coefficient of variation for calibrators and controls at these concentrations distributed throughout a testing batch must also be less than 10%.  A batch will consist of the samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the batch there must not be significant drift in control values.  3.3.  Drug Free Urine.  If so requested by one of the six DoD military drug screening laboratories, the contractor must provide 250 ml of drug free (for amphetamines (including designer amphetamines (MDMA, MDA and MDEA), LSD, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, THCCOOH, Benzoylecgonine, Cocaine, Barbiturates, PCP, 6-acetylmorphine, Opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit) to the requesting laboratory(s).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory requests negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in 1-liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  3.4.  Oxycodone / Oxymorphone Low Control Specificity.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open low Oxycodone quality control samples at 75 ng/ml must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.5.  Oxycodone/ oxymorphone High Control Specificity.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open positive oxycodone quality control samples at 125 ng/ml must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.6.  Coefficient of Variance.  An assay of 20 sequential controls containing drug at 200% of the immunoscreen cutoff concentration, at the immunoscreen cutoff concentration, and 75% of immunoscreen cutoff concentration must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration reading less than 7.5%.   3.7.  Cross-reactivity.  Each immunological reagent shall be checked for cross reactivity to drugs, chemicals, or metabolites that might be expected to produce a positive response.

The contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, facilities and equipment for analytical services in accordance with the Statement of Work and Description of Services. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. Total contract period of performance is 12 months. KEY PERSONNEL. The contractor shall designate a Project Manager who shall be responsible for overseeing the overall project.    PUBLICATION AND OWNERSHIP OF DATA. EPA reserves the right to publish in the open, peer-reviewed scientific literature any and all of the data collected, including output from all data analyses, in the course of this agreement.  Tests and methods developed and validated by Contractor shall supply sufficient experimental detail regarding analysis methods to enable its publication in this literature.  No other analyses of these data will be released in any publication or presentation in any forum without prior review and written approval of the EPA Project Officer, either during the contract period or anytime thereafter.  DELIVERY PRODUCTS. The contractor shall submit two separate reports with the information listed below.  The report shall be of quality to be published in the peer-reviewed literature.  Each report shall include descriptions of: 1) the statistical models used to analyze the data; 2) the procedures used to ensure quality of the statistical work; 3) the results including a)  list of parameters for the single-chemical models, b)  list of parameters for the additivity and mixture models, including tests of significance for deviations from dose-additivity, c)  tests of significance between the two ratios (i.e., do the mixing ratios alter the results),  d)  calculation of ED10s and ED30s (values predicted to produce 10% and 30% decreases, respectively), plus 95% confidence limits, for the single chemical curves, and the additivity and mixture models; 4) conclusions based on the statistical analyses; 5) graphical representations of the results. The carbamate report shall include analyses of the brain and blood cholinesterase activity and total activity counts in two mixing ratios.  The pyrethroid report shall include analyses of the total activity counts in two dosing procedures.  SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES The contractor shall provide analytical services for each study, described below for each of two major projects.  Each service, or study, will constitute a separate task. STUDIES. There will be two major projects based on the type of pesticides examined: carbamates and pyrethroids.  A task shalll include the analyses of each project, i.e., two final products. 1. Carbamates.  A total of 7 carbamates will be included in this mixture.  Each carbamate shall be tested individually to define the dose-response characteristics on: A) brain cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition; B) red blood cell (RBC) ChE inhibition; and C) motor activity.  Dose-response data shall then be collected for two mixtures, using each of these endpoints.  The mixing ratio of the two mixtures will be defined by: A) relative potencies of the individual chemicals, and B) relative human exposure to the individual chemicals based on EPA projections of food, water, and air exposures. Thus, 3 endpoints x 2 mixing ratios = 6 studies 2. 	Pyrethroids.  A total of 11 pyrethroids will be included in this mixture.  Each pyrethroid shall be tested individually to define the dose-response characteristics on motor activity.  Dose-response data shall then be collected for two mixtures.  The mixing ratio of the two mixtures will be the same, however, the time of testing will differ as follows: A) all pesticides given concurrently, and B) pesticides given in a staggered manner before testing.  The mixing ratio will be defined by relative human exposure to the individual chemicals based on EPA projections of food, water, and air exposures.  Dose shall be calculated either as delivered dose or administered dose, but not both. Thus, 1 endpoint x 2 mixture dose-responses = 2 studies. Total, 8 studies to be analyzed.   Statistical Basis of Analysis. The data shall be analyzed by the dose-additivity models previously described, the so-called ?single chemicals required method? (Casey et al., 2004; Gennings et al., 1997, 2002, 2003a,b, 2004; Meadows et al., 2003).  Specifically, single-chemical data will be used, under an assumption of dose-additivity, to predict the response of a fixed-ratio mixture.  A nonlinear threshold model shall be fit to the mixture data in terms of total dose along the specified fixed-ratio of the chemicals.  An overall test of additivity shall be performed by comparing the two models.  The contractor may elect to examine the data by other advanced statistical techniques.  1.	Definition of Additivity. The single chemical dose-response data shall be used to estimate an additivity model.  The additivity model used will be based on the definition of additivity (i.e., zero interaction) given by Berenbaum (e.g., 1985) and is based on the classical isobolograms for the combination of two chemicals (e.g., Loewe and Muischnek, 1926; Loewe, 1953).  2.	Preliminary study of the relationship between the mean and variance. Throughout the analysis of these data, a quasi-likelihood estimation method will be used which is based on assumptions of the model for the mean as a function of dose and the relationship between the variance and the mean. Graphs of the sample variances versus sample means will be used to illustrate the form of this relationship. 3.	Estimation of the Additivity Model. The method of maximum quasi-likelihood shall be used to estimate model parameters.  The adequacy of the fit of the additivity model to the single chemical data will be assessed through a goodness-of-fit test and will be assessed graphically, i.e., the observed and model predicted responses for each single chemical will be provided. The estimated additivity model will be used to predict the mean response along the fixed mixing ratio of the chemicals in terms of total dose. A plot of the predicted response under additivity along the mixture ray in terms of total dose also will be provided. An overall test for departure of the experimental data from the predicted additivity model will be provided. Individual data point predictions will include both the predicted value and the 95% prediction interval for the estimate. In addition, a table of parameter estimates, standard errors, and p values will be included in the analysis report 4.	Estimation of the Mixture Model. A nonlinear threshold model shall be fit to the mixture data. A plot of the observed and model predicted responses in terms of total dose will be provided. Included in this graph will be the predicted curve under the assumption of additivity. Adequacy of the model fit will be conducted graphically. A table of estimated model parameters, standard errors, and p values will be included in the analysis report. Using additivity models as described in Gennings et al (2002), prediction intervals will be produced under additivity at each mixture group and shall be included in the analysis report. 5.	Test of additivity.  Comparison of the mixture model to the additivity model along the fixed-ratio ray shall be statistically conducted based on suitable statistical methods. A 5% significance level shall be used. The results of the test shall be provided in the analysis report. If departure from additivity is detected, the suitability of the data for estimation of an interaction threshold will be determined. If appropriate, the interaction threshold shall be estimated and reported. References. Berenbaum, M.C.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50136-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-05.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Information Systems and Computer Services (ISCS) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to have all ISCS owned environmental systems monitored for events in real-time.  The North American Industry Classification code is 238210, and the business size standard is $12M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction: 
ISCS is responsible for providing user support, application development, network connectivity, and file/print services to the more than 7,000 users conducting research activities. In order to provide these services ISCS maintains data centers both on and off NIH campus locations. The centers allow a secure and environmentally controlled location to house the required network and computing systems. Without these centers cancer research would be greatly impacted.

Background:  
ISCS personnel have been required to monitor the HVAC systems currently in use in NCI data centers. ISCS personnel only know when a failure has occurred when the temperature probe indicates an increase in temperature. This has proven to be inefficient and it has been determined that a new system is required to provide real-time data of the units providing cooling. 

Statement of Work:

Specific Objectives of this Procurement: ISCS specific objectives are to: 1) Have all HVAC systems monitored 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week, 2) Dispatch the appropriate resource to correct reported HVAC failures, 3) Provide monthly reports concerning the systems being monitored to include temperature history, alarms reported, and service personnel dispatched.

2. Furnish and install hardware and software to enable real-time alerts via the NCI communication network.

3. Respond to all alarms reported by the system and notify proper support personnel to correct the problem. ISCS staff will be notified by the contractor during business hours of the problem if corrected. If the problem requires ISCS attention the contractor shall notify the ISCS on-call representative. 

4. Supply monthly status reports on the 1st of each month during the contract period to include the event, date and time, resolution status, and time corrected.

Period of Performance:  One year from issuance of official purchase order.

<DESC>Questions and answers

Flight Chief Office

1. The drawing shows two mirrored, 60” U shaped desks and the list of furniture specified for this area calls for one 72” u shape desk and one 72” double pedestal desk.  Aside from the numbers not matching, judging from the dimensions of the room, listed in the drawing, there is not enough room for these two desks in this one area.  According to my information The line item is for a 60”X 30” desk shell and 71” hutch ( and other items) but with only two 71” hutches that leaves 20 inches to spare  all items will fit. 

2. The styles of these two desks are completely different as well.  The U is a contemporary style and the double pedestal desk is a traditional which may be as intended?
One company is not the same as another and you need to provide what is requested or don’t 

NCOIC Office

The drawing again calls for two mirrored 60” U shaped desks but there are a couple of concerns with the products specified.  

1. The product listing shows the rear portion of the 60” desks are specified with 71” credenzas (PL145) while the hutch is specified as PL125, which is a 48” hutch. Again Please look at all drawings of the room if you look at the 3D drawing you will see that the 71” credenzas is the bottom portion and the 48” is the top  so both are required.   

2. Another concern with a 60” desk and a 24” wide bridge.  The bridge blocks off 24” of the desk and the drawer pedestal takes up 16” as well.  This leaves an open area about 20” wide when you face forward.  Rather small for the average person.  Desks usually should be 66” wide with a 24” return. This is not so of the furniture requested As we have similar product all ready and the requested furniture is what we want 

3. The drawing shows two of the Hon Lateral files but the product descriptions specified lists only one.  This is incorrect!  The first line in the description shows two each 774LB 700 series lateral files 30w 4 drawer w/top binder shelf.  The only items listed as one each for this room is:  the BBF Pedestal, mobile, and the end table.

4. Line item 4 in the product listing calls for PL102 at 60x30.  The PL102 is specified as 66x30 by the supplier. My information shows it as the fifth line item and the part number I have is PL103 you should check your information

All other terms and conditions of this combined solicitation remain the same.

1.  Will per diem be provided for installation personnel?
      Costs for travel and per diem for installation personnel should be included in the total proposal.

2.  Are there any local or state licenses required to perform this work at Vandenberg?
     All work must meet local, state, and federal government electrical codes.  

3.  What level security clearance will be required for on site personnel?
      The building is not a high security building.  Please see the combine solicitation posted on www.eps.gov for further information on Base Passes and Controlled Area Badges.

4.  Where will the computer gear be housed?  Will we need a separate rack-mount?
      In an already cabled/wired room.  (Room 14)    DVRs and monitors will be housed in a room adjacent to the dayroom.

5.   Will the contractor be allowed to tap into the existing base computer network, or will some other dedicated cabling have to be installed?
      This surveillance system will not be hooked up to our network.  Contractors will not be allowed to tap into Vandenberg AFB computer network.    

6.  What are the storage requirements?  e.g. how many days of data need to be stored?  
      30 days.

7.  What kind of support response time is expected?  Within 24 hours or 2-3 days?  What is the criticality of the system?
      We are only buying the camera system, not the services.  Therefore there will be no support response needed.

8.   Is there an incumbent contractor?
      No.

9.  Do you mind if we add a suggested wireless component?
     No wireless components will be considered for this requirement.

10. Will an IP Network Video Management solution be considered that far exceeds the requirements on the DVR units?
       We will not be hooking our surveillance system to our network.

11.  How many outdoor cameras?
       Two (2) outdoor cameras.  These are PTZ cameras.

12.  How many indoor cameras?
       This is a performance based Statement of Work.  Contractors who are submitting a quote will have to figure out how many they will need to meet our requirements.  We only tell them what area needs coverage.

13.  Analog cameras do not have auto focus.  Is this a fixed or PTZ camera?
       Auto focus is a must.  Outdoor cameras are PTZ, however, indoor cameras are fixed.

14.  The specs ask for 2 DVR’s, 2 Monitors, 2 UPS, is this correct?  It is hard to tell without the exact number of indoor and outdoor cameras.
       Yes, this is correct.  One DVR and one monitor will be used to record the student hallways, and the other will be used for the dayroom side of the building.

15.  What is the building structure made of?
        The building is made of concrete for the dorm side.  The dayroom side is steel and concrete.

16.  Is there a conduit requirement, or cable tray above the ceiling?
       There is no existing conduit.  There is ceiling space in some areas that contractors can fish their cables/wires through.  Otherwise wire mold would need to be used.

17.  Will a bid bond and performance payment bonds be required?
        No.

18.  Does the manufacturer for the camera system need to be an American Company?  Or, will foreign manufacturers be acceptable?
       Per the combined solicitation, please reference DFARS 252.225-7001, Buy American Act & Balance of Payment Program.

19.  Can we obtain a copy of the sign in sheet?
       No copy of the sign in sheet will be available.

20.  Will the time of construction be from 0700 to 1630?
       Time of construction will be from 0730 to 1630, Monday through Friday.  But the end user will work with the contractor if they need to work outside of this time frame. 

21.  Do you want to have a vandal resistant dome cameras for the dormitory areas?
       We do want these cameras to be housed in a plastic or similar material half sphere or quarter sphere.   However, we don’t want these cameras to be protected with metal wires or similar type of protective devise.

22.  Are there personnel that will be in the office to operate the parking lot cameras when recording is taking place?  The pan-tilt-zoom cameras require personnel to operate the “head end”.
      Yes.  We do have personnel to man these monitors.

23. If more than 32 cameras are used in the install, there will need to be more than 2 DVR’s, is that acceptable?
      Yes.  It is up to the contractor to determine how many cameras or DVRs.  We don’t specify what type or how many cameras or DVRs for this project.  2 DVRs in the SOW is the minimum, not max.

24.  In regards to camera type specs: due to the low ceilings, Vandal Resistant cameras are the logical choice for the situation, but are not listed in the Scope.  Will they be a requirement?
       Please see answer to question No. 21.

STATEMENT OF WORK
SABIT Regional 4 Program

I.	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Since 1990, SABIT (Special American Business Internship Training Program) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) has provided market and business training to professionals from Eurasia. Providing a unique opportunity to facilitate cross-border cooperation with Eurasia, SABIT helps American organizations form relationships with potential customers, distributors, or partners, who can assist in facilitating profitable international transactions. As relationships of mutual trust are the most significant aspect of interactions between partners in joint ventures, contractual arrangements, or business relations in Eurasia, the linkages formed through SABIT serve as a basis for new business development, and often lead to tangible results. The Interpreter/Facilitator is an integral part of the SABIT team, interpreting and facilitating training sessions and meetings with U.S. organizations as part of the specialized industry programs sponsored and financed by SABIT, in addition to serving as a resource and emergency contact for participants from Eurasia outside of meetings and training sessions.

II.	STATEMENT OF NEED

The SABIT program has a requirement for an Expert/Consultant who shall provide interpretation and facilitation services (hereunto defined as “Interpreter/Facilitator”).

STATEMENT OF WORK
SABIT Regional 3 Program


I.	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Since 1990, SABIT (Special American Business Internship Training Program) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) has provided market and business training to professionals from Eurasia. Providing a unique opportunity to facilitate cross-border cooperation with Eurasia, SABIT helps American organizations form relationships with potential customers, distributors, or partners, who can assist in facilitating profitable international transactions. As relationships of mutual trust are the most significant aspect of interactions between partners in joint ventures, contractual arrangements, or business relations in Eurasia, the linkages formed through SABIT serve as a basis for new business development, and often lead to tangible results. The Interpreter/Facilitator is an integral part of the SABIT team, interpreting and facilitating training sessions and meetings with U.S. organizations as part of the specialized industry programs sponsored and financed by SABIT, in addition to serving as a resource and emergency contact for participants from Eurasia outside of meetings and training sessions.

II.	STATEMENT OF NEED

The SABIT program has a requirement for an Expert/Consultant who shall provide interpretation and facilitation services (hereunto defined as “Interpreter/Facilitator”).  The Interpreter/Facilitator shall provide interpretation and facilitation services for the scheduled program meetings each day for each program session. Each session consists of 29 consecutive working days. There will be three program sessions for each requirement outlined in this statement of work. 

III.	SCOPE OF WORK

The major objective of this procurement is to define the necessary requirements to ensure a high level of professional interpretation and facilitation within the SABIT Program. Specific objectives have been defined with respect to the work outlined in this Statement of Work:

2.	Help SABIT meet its program objectives and performance measures by providing timely and high quality overall facilitation and interpretation of the sessions.

3.	Identify strengths and weaknesses of each session, providing feedback to SABIT Program Officers, through final reports, meetings, and informal discussions, that will enable SABIT to better meet the needs of both the U.S. Host Organizations and the Eurasian participants.

IV.	REQUIREMENTS
