<DESC>This is a resynopsis of solicitation N61331-04-R-0030 and it is renumbered to N61331-04-R-0065.  Solicitation N61331-04-R-0030 was initially synopsized on 12 April 2004, the synopsis modified on 23 July 2004, and the initial solicitation (which was never issued) cancelled in Federal Business Opportunities on 23 September 2004. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for, technology assessment, program management and engineering services support for Increment 1 development of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) system to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent non-profit organization, of Johnstown, PA. The period of performance will be for five years. The proposed contract will provide for term form delivery orders and will contain Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions that prohibit the contractor from participating in production of the DJC2 Increment 2 and beyond systems. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  CTC, as an independent non-profit corporation, has established itself as DODs independent third-party technology verification center. This unique competence has been used on numerous occasions by the DOD t! o ensure accurate and independently verified decisions are being made to transfer the optimum technology to DOD installations.  This competence has also been used to certify the performance of materials and equipment for addition to the DOD buyers list.  Additionally, CTC has been intimately involved in the design, development and deployment of the DJC2 prototype.  The DJC2 delivery schedule is compressed and critical.  It is imperative that CTCs experience with the DJC2 prototype be leveraged to prevent program duplication and unacceptable delay.   Additionally,  CTC operates four major Defense Centers of Excellence:  the National Center for Excellence in Metalworking Technology (NCEMT); the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE); the National Applied Software Engineering Center (NASEC); and the Systems Of Systems Engineering Center of Excellence (SoSECE).  These centers maintain essential capabilities in materials and processing, environmental enginee! ring, electronic commerce, information management, software engineering, Systems of Systems Engineering, laboratory operations and techniques, and structured training for technicians, professionals, and others. This provides DJC2 with access to capabilities directly applicable to technology transition.  CTC provides a means for applying critical advanced environmental, manufacturing, information, and software technologies to the solution of technical problems that directly face DJC2 during Increment 1. CTC has developed state-of-the-art technology and services in virtual reality, 3-D scientific visualization and collaborative engineering to provide cost-effective solutions that support the decision-making process that are of direct interest to the DJC2 development phase. These technological services have been applied to a variety of domains including battlefield visualization and simulations, process and product design, real-time network monitoring, mission familiarization a! nd architectural design.  NAICS Code is 541330.  Contract Specialist: Allan Ziemba, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 (850) 235-5197, FAX (850) 234-4251.

<DESC>This is a synopsis issued for a proposed acquisition to be solicited under Full and Open Competition procedures. The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Defined-Benefits Technology Solution for its Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) initiative. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal and price quotation. 

The resulting performance-based contract will enable us to license the use of an existing, proven technology solution from an experienced provider of defined-benefits retirement services. The system will be hosted, maintained, and enhanced by the offeror, reducing the risk we face with a large information technology implementation to modernize OPM’s retirement systems.

The desired solution will provide functionality and processing, and allow us to operate the system with our existing staff resources. We expect to license one or more of a number of already existing proprietary applications that have been designed specifically for defined benefits administration. 

We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a teaming effort. The chosen offeror or offerors will provide software and services that will support our administration of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). The total set of capabilities to be provided will be determined based upon the offeror’s submissions and will weigh the costs, benefits, and risks, including the required degree of customization of the proposed offeror’s solutions. 

The offeror’s solution should support:
1.	claims processing:
2.	annuity payroll processing and recordkeeping; 
3.	member recordkeeping; and
4.	proactive communications to members and annuitants. 

It should also include case tracking capabilities to support reconsideration requests, court order processing, and overpayment collections. The solution should also provide self-service capabilities, such as address changes and tax withholding changes, for annuitants, and provide information to enable our customer service representatives to provide customer service to program participants.

We wish to purchase the services described in the draft solicitation under terms and conditions similar to those that typically apply to similar purchases in the private sector. However, we have unique Federal Government constraints and we must ensure that the services we purchase meet the Federal retirement system’s unique characteristics. We therefore invite interested offerors to review our draft solicitation and provide meaningful comments.

To enhance our final solicitation request, please provide answers to the following questions:

1.	 Please review the draft solicitation, particularly the constraints, which we provide in Attachment 3. Please discuss in detail any constraints or conditions that you view as potentially problematic or have the potential to disproportionately increase the price of the services we are requesting. Provide an explanation of why a particular constraint or condition presents a challenge and suggest an alternative recommendation you think presents less of a challenge and still meets our desired outcome.

2.	We wish to secure the benefits of competition, both in terms of pricing and delivery quality, over the life of any contract that may arise from this competition. Therefore, we are contemplating and will consider making a single award (a teaming effort) or multiple awards, in which more than one vendor will receive an award and the population of retirement accounts may be divided among those vendors. Over the life of the contract, we may choose to redistribute retirement accounts among vendors based on price or service quality.

Please comment on our proposed approach and identify any implications and describe the risks and rewards associated with such an approach.

3.	We wish to allow vendors flexibility in defining the structure of their offers, while still maintaining comparability among offers.

Please review the pricing instructions in the draft solicitation (Section B), and comment on whether our form and structure provides you sufficient flexibility to define the elements of a solution in a meaningful way that will be manageable over the life of the contract. Also, please also provide a preliminary outline of the components of your solution by completing the first four columns of Attachment 1, Contract Worksheet, and the first three columns of Attachment 2, Performance Requirements Summary Template. 

4.	Also provide any additional comments on the draft solicitation that you think we should consider to ensure a healthy competition among prospective offerors and provide prospective offerors with the necessary information to effectively develop a response to this solicitation. 

5.	We would like to restrict the size of the proposal packages we receive to ensure an efficient evaluation. 

Please comment on whether the number of pages allowed in Section L is sufficient to enable a complete response to the solicitation. 

6.	The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). The corresponding Small Business Administration size standard for this NAICS code is $21.0 million in average annual receipts. In these terms, is your company a large or a small business?

While it is not mandatory that offerors provide responses to these questions, we are interested in industry comment on this draft solicitation and encourage you to submit comments and question. We will consider your comments and questions when finalizing the solicitation. However, we will not disclose any questions and comments that are submitted, except as required by FAR 15.201(f).

Please send your comments and questions on this draft solicitation to George Leininger, Contract Specialist, either in hardcopy or email, our preferred method.  We listed the Contracting Office and email addresses above in this synopsis.  Your response to this request is due no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, August 6, 2004.

We provided technical data and background information relevant to the RFP in Section J of the draft. 

Place of Performance:    	United States
Duration of the contract period:    	Various, maximum of ten years if all option periods are executed
Delivery Schedule:	To be determined by the offeror

We anticipate issuing the final solicitation on or about August 23, 2004. Proposals will be due on or about September 10, 2004. An additional opportunity for questions will be offered. Our award decision will be based on a best-value determination: All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. Demonstrations of software solutions may be required. Anticipated contract award date is December 16, 2004.

<RESPDATE>101204
<ARCHDATE>11122004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Joshua Bowers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2104
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, OH, on a sole source basis with the University of Wisconsin under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to conduct a study to determine the fate and transport of the prions in chronic wasting disease (CWD) infected wastes in municipal solid waste landfills. The work includes determining the potential transport of the prions through fill material and the potential for the prions to be discharged off-site to local publically owned treatment works  (POTWs) in the leachate. Specifically, the contractor shall: (1) conduct column tests on simulated solid waste and actual solid waste from landfills, (2) conduct batch tests using sorbents employed for the column tests.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates  the University of Wisconsin is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. This is based on permitting requirements, qualifications and existing research efforts. First, the University of Wisconsin is permitted to handle prions  from Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), which is an infectious waste that is contagious among the deer and elk population. It is the only known research institution with facilities that have an acceptable safety protocol for conducting engineering studies using prions. Second, the University has a  unique research group comprised of varied disciplines that brings together the needed expertise to conduct this project including veterinary medicine, soil science, and wastewater treatment.  Finally, the University has ongoing work to develop the analytical methodologies for detecting prions in  the environment. They have also synthesized the only labeled prion available that will allow for their detection in the environment outside of infected animal tissue. In sum, the University of Wisconsin has the unique capabilities of combining the expertise and the facilities necessary to conduct  this research on the fate and transport of prions in municipal solid waste landfills. No other known source has the combined advantage of the expertise, the facilities, the access to the process, and the capability to complete such a sophisticated project. However, any firm believing itself  capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project. Such documentation must be submitted by 1:00 PM EST, Tuesday October 12, 2004. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition  Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: by fax to 513.487.2109, or by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-04-00192.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 42--Decontamination Systems and Technology.  The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).  This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.  “Mature,” is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.  TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.  Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.  Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or “slip ins” are acceptable).  Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.

The purpose of this document is to identify potential sources. There is no solicitation document at this time. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. : The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).  This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.  “Mature,” is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.  TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.  Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.  Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
.

Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or “slip ins” are acceptable).  Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.  Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. 2) Demonstrate a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.  3) Supply decontaminant/ system information on material compatibility. The general materials in the various platforms consist of categories such as plastics, alloys, elastomers, metals to name a few. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided. 4) Supply Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all products.  5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. 6) Not produce any uncontrollable hazards (residue or secondary) that are toxic or corrosive during decontamination operations. 7) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options.  8) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.  9) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP.  10) Using its product, provide the results of developmental and operational testing in the decontamination of integral sensitive equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, and terrain.  11) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, aircraft, vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within. 12) Identify on-going federal, commercial, DoD contractual effort that is within scope of the above objectives along with point of contact and contact information.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) W58RGZ-05-R-0004 for the purpose of obtaining industry review and comment on the solicitation and requirements documents.  These documents are to  be utilized in the conduct of a full and open competitive procurement that satisfies the U.S. Army's Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) requirements.  Proposals are not solicited and shall not be submitted in response to this special notice.  THE GOVERNMENT D OES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS DRFP OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  The LUH will utilize a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) / Non-Developmental Item (NDI) aircraft to conduct light general support, civil search and rescue, personnel recovery, air ambulance Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC), limited  civil command and control operations in the conduct of Homeland Security (HLS), and counter drug operations.  The LUH is intended to perform these functions only in permissive, non-hostile, non-combat operational environments.  The primary users for the L UH are the Active Army Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) units and the Army National Guard (ARNG). A best value approach will be used in the source selection process.  The Government anticipates that a contract with priced lines for production, spare parts, training, maintenance, and engineering services will be awarded in FY05, with a period of perform ance of eight years (FY05-FY12).  The basic contract will be a firm-fixed price, multiple-year contract with specified options.   A copy of the DRFP and supporting documentation may be accessed via the Internet on or about October 15, 2004 at https://wwwproc.redstone.army.mil/acquisition/current_business.html.  After reaching the website, choose the link Light Utility Helicopter to  view or download the DRFP. The LUH Program Office will host an Industry Day on or about October 22, 2004 to present general unclassified information on the U S Army's projected procurement strategy of an LUH System, the Armys vision of the LUH mission, and to answer questions conce rning the DRFP. Detailed information regarding Industry Day will be posted on the above website.  This invitation to participate in the Industry Day does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal; however, we are interested in resolvin g industry concerns prior to the release of the final RFP. Point of contact is Mrs. Bridgett Helem, Contracting Officer, 256-876-5610.

<SOLNBR>AWB-RFI-04-0009
<RESPDATE>102204
<ARCHDATE>11052004
<CONTACT>Becky Briggs, Contract Specialist, Phone 208-828-3108, Fax 208-828-2658, Email Becky.Briggs@mountainhome.af.mil - Aubrey Coyle,Jr, Contracting Officer, Phone 208-828-3103, Fax 208-828-6486, Email Stu.Coyle@mountainhome.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available aircraft stores loader.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force aircraft stores loaders are airframe specific.  Some are actually made by the unit causing equipment damage and personal injury. A single stores loader will reduce mobility footprint, logistics tail and increase effectiveness of loading capabilities on fighter aircraft. 

The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

	These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	A platform height range adjustable from 1 inches to 45 inches
2.	A total unit length not to exceed 108 inches and a width not to exceed 44 inches
3.	750 lb load capacity on raised platform
4.	780 lb total unit weight
5.	A simple elevation mechanism
6.	Able to withstand the rigors of towing and using in an all weather flightline environment

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from Industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Your interest to demonstrate your product.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 22 Oct 04 to MSgt Joseph Pratt, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  MSgt Pratt can be reached at (208) 828-3517.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This modification to Solicitation RFP FSA-R-40-04DC provides answers to questions that were presented to the Government.

In response to questions asked regarding Solicitation FSA-R-40-04DC, for Copier Maintenance.  Here are answers to those questions:

1) Under Labor Wage Determination, #94-2103 (Rev 32) dated 5/27/2004 (Referenced)
    There is a category at the end 23700? Office Appliance Repairer - $18.95

Question:   Is this the category that a copier service technician will be under?  
ANSWER: YES
  
Question:  Is this the minimum salary that the copier service technician should be paid? 
ANSWER: YES


2) Based on the list of machines (72 machines) the majority are located at 1400 Independence Ave, S.W.
Question:   Would the customer be opened to the idea of having a on-site technician at this site?  Would the customer have a storage place to have supplies and parts on hand?  
ANSWER: The Government would supply space for an on-site technician and storage.
 

3) In order to meet the required monthly meter readings, The Contractor would have to assign a person to do that task on a continues basis.  To keep costs down, are you willing to have the key copier operators submit the monthly meter readings via a customized website.  We would train the key operators.  It is very simple and it would be customized so they only have to enter their e-mail and it will capture the serial number of the copier, being ready to just type in the meter reading.  Question: Would that be possible? 
ANSWER:  The on-site technician should collect meter readings.


4) Question: Would you consider taking meter readings every quarter?
ANSWER: Quarterly readings would be fine. (This would be acceptable to the Government)

The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

A critical area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) is the development and deployment of technologies to protect the nation’s cyber infrastructure including the Internet and other critical infrastructures that depend on computer systems for their mission. The goals of the DHS HSARPA CSRD program are to:
•	Perform the underlying research and development (R&D) to improve existing deployed technologies and to ensure the security of new emerging systems;
•	Develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of, prevention of, and response to cyber attacks on the nation’s infrastructure.  
•	Transfer these technologies into the national infrastructure as a matter of urgency.
To achieve these goals, the HSARPA CSRD BAA 04-17 solicits proposals that address one of the seven technical topic areas (TTAs) described in the BAA.

POSITION TITLE: Senior Engineer

MARKET VALUE:  GS-14

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year with an option to renew for up to one additional year.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Cairo, Egypt. 

SECURITY ACCESS: Employment Authorization (no access)

AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens/U.S. Resident Aliens

POSITION DESCRIPTION

I. 	Introduction: 
             
Organizational Location of the Position:  The position requires residence in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.

USAID/Egypt Program:  USAID/Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse programs in USAID.  The program is highly visible and consequently attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight, and Congressional scrutiny.  

Over the last 25 years, USAID has made a $5.0 billion investment in the electric power and water and wastewater (W/W) sector in Egypt.   Under the power program, USAID’s objective is to increase capacity and improve efficiency of electric power grid control centers, power plants and distribution lines.  Over $2.5 billion has been invested for construction and modernization of power infrastructure, institutional development and power sector reforms. USAID is currently managing a power sector program including almost $250 million of power utility construction and additional programs in power institutional/policy support.  The institutional programs include financial management training, establishment of a power pool for power transactions, establishment and support of an electric power regulatory agency and leadership development programs in electric power management training. 

Under the water and wastewater program, USAID’s objective is to improve access by Egyptians to more reliable, higher-quality utility services.  This is accomplished by increasing the capacity and efficiency of W/W infrastructure, improving the cost recovery and commercial orientation of utilities companies, and assisting in the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework needed to encourage private sector management and financing.  Expanded and more effectively managed W/W infrastructure facilities will improve urban environmental quality and the health of millions of Egyptians, and will enhance service delivery.  To achieve its development objectives, USAID is currently managing a W/W program valued at approximately $750 million.  Most funding is programmed for the construction of major new W/W treatment facilities.
  
II.	Basic Functions

Based in Cairo, the Senior Engineer will report to the USAID/Cairo Team Leader for the water/wastewater, telecommunications and power components of the Infrastructure Strategic Objective (SO) Team. The Senior Engineer will serve as an engineering officer and activity manager for assigned portions of the USAID-financed W/W, telecommunications and power program portfolio.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MCSC), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS), Radar Systems Program Manager is seeking information on the ability to develop and produce a light-weight, highly mobile/expeditionary transportable array replacement/upgrade for the currently fielded AN/TPS-59(V)3 long range radar system.  At a minimum, the replacement/upgraded array will require connection to the current AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar electronics control shelter and maximize the reuse of all functionality to include software and hardware.  The next generation array must have growth potential to be coupled with an upgraded expeditionary electronics and maintenance shelter being procured from the AN/TPS-59 OEM.  The upgraded shelter will encompass software and hardware improvements for increased performance; open architecture; reduction of obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources; and increased mobility.  The new array and mobile control/maintenance shelter will provide a three-dimensional, long range radar capable of providing Anti-Air Warfare units of the Marine Aviation Combat Element (ACE) with sufficient advanced warning and target information to allow for threat evaluation and responsive action, including air raid warning of targeted forces and neutralization of the threat. The radar must provide air controllers with a precise, true air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. The logistical footprint of the radar system must be reduced to a maximum of two (2) MTVR, MK27/28 variant and two trailers; this also includes all support equipment as technology permits, while maintaining the performance outlined in the Draft Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3-DELRR) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and the Draft Technical Systems Requirement Document (TSRD). Downsizing and weight reduction are the key to improved transportability, mobility, flexibility and reduced setup time. In the case of Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) operations, the radar must have the capability, in the interim, to disseminate target information to the AN/MSQ-123 Air Defense Communications Platform (ADCP) and the AN/TYQ-23 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM) and in the future, the ability to disseminate all information to the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) through the use of open architecture, to include interoperability with Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) Composite Tracking Network (CTN) and Netted Sensors for dissemination to all air defense agencies (Marine Corps and Joint Services) and Surface to Air Missile (SAM) firing batteries (Marine Corps and Joint Services) by way of a common digital data link and open architecture. The mature system must provide target information to the Marine Corps SAM system. The radar must contribute to the Marine Air Ground Task Force’s ability to integrate air defense assets, both within the Marine Corps and across a joint interface. In support of its TMD role, the updated array must also improve on target processing capability, detection and tracking and improve survivability.
	Maximum use of advanced technology in array development and design is highly encouraged for maximum benefit of producing a complete system that meets or exceeds the mobility and transportability requirements outlined in the draft ORD and draft TSRD documentation while also maintaining and improving performance of the next generation long range radar system for the United States Marine Corps.  The upgraded array must be built within the funding constraints that are outlined in the development phase of the current profile for HELRASR.  This funding is an estimate only and is subject to change.
	Supportability considerations should be addressed in the design and development of the upgraded array, to include complete support for sustainment throughout the life of the system.  Critical to the support of the system is maintenance and support philosophy.   Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and maintenance concepts that reduce the amount of life cycle cost to the using unit should be addressed and included in the overall design of the system.  Autonomic logistics are essential for the complete monitoring of the system both electronically and mechanically and is critical to the assessment of the health of the new upgraded system.  Supportability considerations should also address seabased logistics and integrated data environment capabilities.

Contractors are invited to read (only) the draft 3-DELRR Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and draft Technical Systems Requirement Document (TSRD) at Anteon Corporation (16 Center St. Suite 109, Stafford, Virginia 22556) by coordinating a visit request in advance with Ms. Cathy Henderson at (703) 432-4157.

Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Jenny Rieck, by 29 October 2004.  Please submit all information to Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: A/C Contracts/Ms. Jenny Rieck, 2200 Lester St., Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>Funds are not presently available for this purchase.  The Government’s obligation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available and an order is issued, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.

This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with Data Security Inc. for the support of USSOCOM’s Enterprise Systems Division.  A minimum requirement for the Enterprise Systems Divisions requires the ability to degauss classified hard drives and media.  Data Security Inc meets DoD guidelines for purging, and is also listed in the DPL as meeting this requirement.  MacDill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to Data Security Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Additionally, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) applies, a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and an unacceptable delay would result in not continuing the provision of these highly specialized services from Data Security Inc.

SEPT. 24, 2004 SITE VISIT MINUTES

SITE VISIT START: 1000	                                                  SITE VISIT END: 1235

	The following subjects and questions were discussed at the September 24, 2004 site visit at the flight line gates for synopsis/solicitation 04-Q-0425, Mortise Locks.  The attendees were:

			
				Ms. Hebert		Contract Specialist
				MSgt Chinery		Technical Representative
				TSgt Leopard		Technical Representative
				Mr. Meacham		Best Access Systems
				Mr. Buchanan		Best Access Systems
				Mr. McClanahan	Best Access Systems
				Mr. Sarate		Total Security Products
				Mr. Brown		Palmetto Southern
				
1)	The meeting began by all parties discussing the proper solution for the scope of this project, security system for (40) flight line pedestrian gates.     

2)	Mr. McClanahan addressed areas of concern about having mortise locks for these wrought-iron gates.  He stated that if mortise locks were installed, his company would have to install some sort of shield on the middle of the gate to prevent reach-around access.  Mr. McClanahan stated that mortise locks are normally installed on doors instead of gates.  MSgt Chinery stated that a shield would not be aesthetically pleasing for this project.  

3)	MSgt Chinery stressed that he wanted this security system to have a keypad and a magnetic stripe reader for the Common Access Card (CAC) – dual pin credentials.  Mr. Meachum stated that if mortise locks were installed, someone would have to go to every gate whenever a personnel change occurs – this is referred to as a stand-alone system.  The mortise locks maintain all software information on a personal data assistant (PDA), which would need to be plugged-in to each individual lock for any updates.  

4)	Mr. McClanahan described a different solution to fulfill this requirement – a Hard-wired System.  This system would connect all of the gates to one central software system within the Security Forces office.  Whenever a personnel change occurs, it would automatically send that information to all flight line pedestrian gates.  However, this system would cost approximately three to five thousand dollars per gate – a stand-alone system only costs approximately fifteen to twenty five hundred.  

5)	MSgt Chinery stated this is a force protection project and Security Forces would need a centralized system instead of a stand-alone system.  Both of the technical representatives agreed that the scope of this project has changed and would be re-addressed next fiscal year.  TSgt Leopard informed Ms. Hebert that he would send a cancellation notice via e-mail for the current Form 9.  

6)	There being no further business, this meeting adjourned at 1235.

<DESC>In response to questions asked regarding Solicitation FSA-R-40-04DC, for Copier Maintenance.  Here are answers to those questions:

1) Under Labor Wage Determination, #94-2103 (Rev 32) dated 5/27/2004 (Referenced)
    There is a category at the end 23700? Office Appliance Repairer - $18.95

Question:   Is this the category that a copier service technician will be under?  
ANSWER: YES
  
Question:  Is this the minimum salary that the copier service technician should be paid? 
ANSWER: YES


2) Based on the list of machines (72 machines) the majority are located at 1400 Independence Ave, S.W.
Question:   Would the customer be opened to the idea of having a on-site technician at this site?  Would the customer have a storage place to have supplies and parts on hand?  
ANSWER: The Government would supply space for an on-site technician and storage.
 

3) In order to meet the required monthly meter readings, The Contractor would have to assign a person to do that task on a continues basis.  To keep costs down, are you willing to have the key copier operators submit the monthly meter readings via a customized website.  We would train the key operators.  It is very simple and it would be customized so they only have to enter their e-mail and it will capture the serial number of the copier, being ready to just type in the meter reading.  Question: Would that be possible? 
ANSWER:  The on-site technician should collect meter readings.


4) Question: Would you consider taking meter readings every quarter?
ANSWER: Quarterly readings would be fine. (This would be acceptable to the Government)

- As a result from questions already submitted, here are a few Q/A's.

Question (Part 1):

1. Please advise the capacity of the Generator you need for this portable a/c unit?

2. Do you intend to use the generator to power any other devise or need 120-volt outlets? 

3. I understand total Duct you will want is 200 feet (100 ea for supply & return) if they are insulated it will be hard to store them, as it will not be as flexible. 

Answers (Part 1): 

1. The capacity of the generator should be at least 50KW.     

2. The generator and the AC unit will primarily be dedicated to each other.  However in the case of an emergency, we would like the flexibility to connecting the AC unit to a building power source and to connect just the generator to other power requirements.     
     
3. Insulated ducting is preferred if we can easily store it, but it is not necessary - un-insulated flex ducting will work.  The quantity required per duct is 100 ft (one supply and one return = 200 total ft, two supplies and two returns = 400 total ft, etc).  The ductwork should be in 25 ft sections with interlocking collars.  Weatherproof storage on the trailer for the ductwork needs to be included.


Question (Part 2): 

1. What is the minimum continuous operation time before re-fueling?  
 
2. What is the maximum trailer length?  What is your ideal trailer length?  
 
3. Are you OK with tongue weight or do you want a four-wheel trailer?  
 
4. For shore power, do you want 480VAC 3 Phase pin and sleeve connector or something else?  

5. What is the ambient operating temperature?  

Answers (Part 2): 

1. 24 hours

2. The trailer should be long enough to hold the AC unit, the generator, the fuel tank, and the container for the flex ducting and cables.

3. Trailer should be gooseneck and sufficient for the load.  Two tandem axles are recommended.  

4. The extra generator outlet (for powering devices other than the AC unit) should be 120V / 20-30 Amp. The alternate power for the AC unit should be whatever the unit requires.

5. 95°F, 105°F?  70-110°F
