(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, will not be used. The comparative evaluation procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3). (see attachment 5)
The Government will award a Firm-Fixed Price contract to the responsible quoter using a comparative evaluation. The comparative evaluation will be performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3). The government reserves the right to select a quotation that provides benefit to the government that exceeds the minimum but is not required to do so. Quoters are advised that quotation may exceed the requirements but the government is not requesting or accepting alternate quotes; each response must respond to the solicitation requirement, stated in the RFQ. 
The government will apply the following comparative evaluation process as the basis for award:
Assess the direct comparison of one quote with another using a uniform and fair approach to determine which quote provides the government what it needs, where and when in accordance with the PWS and RFQ.
Once one quotation is found acceptable, it is compared to the remaining ones, and the  best  one is chosen for the best value to the government.
The Government may rely on internal documentation including the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and contracting officer s knowledge of and previous experience with supply or service being acquired for determining Past Performance.  If no record of past performance is found in FAPIS or PPIRS, the contract shall not receive a favorable or unfavorable rating, but shall receive a rating of neutral.   
Price shall be submitted using the attached Price Schedule.
The government will evaluate prices for the option under FAR 52.217-8  by using the final year s option prices to calculate the price for six months of effort, and adding that amount to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price.
Information not contained in a vendor s quote will not be considered during the evaluation. The Government intends to make award selection without clarification, but may determine after evaluating submitted quotes that the elements stated in FAR 13.106-2(b) for evaluation procedures are necessary, and conduct them as appropriate.  The Government reserves the right to make no award if no quotes meet the requirements of this solicitation.

(x) To be eligible for award offerors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award in accordance with the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
