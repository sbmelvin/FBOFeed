<DESC>NASA has designed a course focusing on areas of business management that are critical for success in competing for NASA contracts and subcontracts.  The NASA course is known as Training and Development of Small Businesses in Advanced Technologies (TADSBAT).  The Internet Home Page for the NASA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization contains additional information on this program at:  osdbu.nasa.gov or http://www.mta-inc.com. BACKGROUND: Nearly one-third of NASA's approximate $11 billion annual contracting budget is spent on prime and subcontracts to small businesses.  More than $2 billion is awarded to small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned firms and minority educational institutions.  Yet there are still small business out there that are intimidated at going after NASA contracts and subcontracts because they erroneously believe that it is overly complex and cumbersome.  The TADSBAT course was created to show small businesses how to market to NASA, how to compete for NASA contracts and subcontracts, how to perform contracts for NASA, and how to close out contracts for NASA.	Since 1994, NASA has provided this training to over 1800 small businesses owners and executives with overwhelming success.  The course is offered FREE (no registration fee). ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: All small businesses are eligible for this course, along with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including women-owned), Historically Black College and Universities and Minority Institutions that possess technical capabilities related to NASA's mission and the five strategic enterprises as discussed in NASA's strategic plan at: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/nsp/cover.html. ADVANCED COURSE	     May 20 - 22, 2003  Ames Research Center  Moffett Field, CA.  MTA0303		    	  All classes are limited to 50 participants.  SDBs, SBs, or HBCUs interested in "Winning NASA Contracts" should contact Gloria Smith, Workshop Coordinator, at 688 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806.

<DESC>Information Assurance For The US Intelligence Community BAA The following is a brief detail of this BAA.  For full detail on requirement and proposal instructions, please see http://www.nbc.gov/infoassurance.cfm.   I.	INTRODUCTION:   The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), invites the submission of research proposals that provide novel and innovative approaches, breakthrough technologies, and/or leap-ahead technologies for difficult information assurance problems that exist within the US Intelligence Community (IC) information infrastructure. Appendix A provides more background information on ARDA. This Broad Area Announcement (BAA) seeks focused  research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following four information assurance (IA) areas: 1.	Countering Malicious Insider Threats; 2.	Attack Attribution;  3.	High Assurance for IC Information Infrastructure; and  4.	New Defensive Concepts For this BAA, each of the above IA areas is subdivided into general and specific research areas of interest.  For further details, see the Proposal Information Pamphlet at http://www.nbc.gov/infoassurance.cfm.   ARDA anticipates the award of multiple proposals, but not all acceptable proposals will be awarded.  Awards will be determined by availability of funding. II. GENERAL INFORMATION An individual proposal may address only one of the four research areas identified above. However, multiple proposals may be submitted by a single offeror. The research area of primary interest should be clearly identified in the proposal. Proposals must also clearly identifythe subtopic(s) within the main research area that the proposal is addressing.  Multiple subtopics within a research area may be addressed within a single proposal.  However, where multiple research subtopics are addressed, separate technical, cost and deliverable information must be provided for the work proposed.  Teaming between industry, independent research centers and academia is encouraged, and commercial technology may be leveraged wherever possible.  According to DFARS 235.017-1, certain Federal Labs may submit proposals. For eligible Federal Labs, partnering with a university or private company is not required. From DFARS 235.017-1: 	"DoD-sponsored FFRDC's that function primarily as research laboratories (C3I Laboratory operated by the Institute for Defense Analysis, Lincoln Laboratory operated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Software Engineering Institute) may respond to solicitations and announcements for programs which promote research, development, demonstration, or transfer of technology (Section 217, Pub.L.103-337)." DoD- and DOE-sponsored FFRDCs may also respond to this BAA. The full list of DoD-and DOE-sponsored FFRDCs is maintained by the National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/nsf03308/start.htm). The government shall have unlimited rights to all technical data and software that directly result from this research. The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. Period of Performance: Phase 1 shall be a basic period of 18 months after contract award and incrementally funded in FY03 and FY04. Phase 2 shall be for a period of 12 months and be exercised as an option in FY05. Total Program Funding: Funding for the base efforts (FY03/FY04- Phase 1) is anticipated to be $11,000,000 and for the Option efforts (FY05- Phase 2) is anticipated to be $5,000,000. Multiple awards are anticipated. It is anticipated that subsequent rounds of this BAA will also have a similar phase 1 and 2 approach i.e., 18 month followed by a 12 month option .  Individual Awards: Phase 1 (FY03/FY04) awards are expected to be in the range of  $750K with possible option year awards bringing the total to in excess of 1 million dollars.  The amount of the award will vary according to the type of effort undertaken.  These figures are estimates only.   This BAA will remain open for 3 years after the publishing date. The initial round deadline is 8 Jun 2003.  Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) that provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria.  It is available at http://www.nbc.gov/infoassurance.cfm.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or official mail.

<DESC>NA The Army Northern Region Contracting Center at Fort Eustis, Virginia is planning to extend contract DABT60-97-D-0001, FFP, services with Sprint Communication Company, LP for providing Video Teletraining equipment and communication services to over 250 Vide o Teletraining Network (TNET) sites and communication services worldwide for the Army Distributed Learning System classrooms and the Army Classroom XXI Program.  The extension will be for a one-year base period (1 Nov 03 - 30 Oct 04) with a one-year option .  The extension is required for the continuation of Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) communication service which should take approximately 1-2 years to complete the transition. This extension is necessary due to the critical nature of continuity of operations.  The Army cannot experience any down time associated with transition to a new vendor.  Additionally, the Army cannot afford the cost of parallel operations during any transition. DISA will be providing all long-haul communication services in  the future.  A follow-on Award Term contract will be offered competitively for equipment/commo service after the transition.  Sprint is now providing high quality compressed video (384 kbps typical); still-frame graphics (multiplexed on video carrier and timeshared with motion video); high quality, digitized audio (32kbps, multiplexed on video carrier and timeshared with motion video); (KU-band VSAT) OCONUS and CONUS satellite links; multipoint interactive network; fully-bridged separate audio; broadcast m ultipoint video (dynamic selection, any site to all sites); internet protocol over frame relay; network control/hub services for Defense Information Switched Network (DISN) for Distributed Learning System (DLS) facilities, commercially provided lines, sate llite links (CONUS and OCONUS), and video teletraining equipment.

<DESC>The U.S Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region (SAR), maintains a ship stowage facility for obsolete ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River in Fort Eustis, VA.  These ships have become obsolete, many are in a dilapidated, unsafe condition, and to some degree all contain various quantities of fuels, oils, asbestos, PCBs, lead paint, and other hazardous materials and wastes.  It is the intent of MARAD to issue a Two-Step Invitation to Bid (IFB) within the next month for the complete dismantling and hazardous materials/hazardous waste (HM/HW) remediation and disposal of four (4) of the ships in the JRRF.  The IFB is limited to domestic ship disposal proposals due to the condition of the vessels and their inability to be towed outside of the United States. MARAD has not yet selected the four ships to be dismantled, but they will be identified at the time the IFB is released. Depending upon the bids received, each ship may be awarded separately, or multiple awards may be made involving any combination of the ships, or alternatively only one award may be made for all four ships.  It is the intent of the Government to contract for the dismantling portion of the work on a firm fixed price basis, with the HM/HW remediation/disposal performed on a cost basis based on actual, verifiable quantities.   It is expected that the IFB for this effort will be issued on the FedBizOps website in February of 2003. The IFB will be issued subject to the availability of funding.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst plans to release draft solicitation N68335-03-R-0015 on or around 3 Feb 2003 for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) .
 
The Navy defines EMALS as four major subsystems:  an energy storage subsystem, a power conditioning subsystem, a launch motor subsystem and a launch control subsystem.   Program goals include the ability to increase the launch performance envelope and reduce installed weight, volume and manning workload requirements over current steam catapults.  
  
EMALS is being conducted as a multi-phase procurement.  The program started with a Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase synopsized in July 1999 (CBD Submission No. 349470). Both General Atomics of San Diego, California and Northrop Grumman of Sunnyvale, California received awards for the PDRR phase of the program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be awarded based on a limited competition between these two companies.

Basis of award for the EMD solicitation will be Best Value evaluation.  Award criteria for the EMD solicitation will include demonstrated completion of specified PDRR requirements with full scale, fully integrated EMALS hardware.  The Government will choose one concept resulting in a final, militarized version of the EMALS.    

The purpose of the draft solicitation is to promote early exchanges of  information about acquisition strategy and feasibility of the requirement. The formal RFP is expected to be released, under an approved J&A, during the July 2003 timeframe, and will be  synopsized prior to release.  The Government intends to issue a new, formal solicitation for the subsequent production phase  which will follow the EMD phase.  
 
The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice nor will the Government compensate any respondent for costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  Any comments provided may not necessarily be included in a formal solicitation.  

The draft RFP contains data subject to the Export Control Act.  This information may only be released to individuals or enterprises that have been certified by the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC).  It is requested that any interested parties submit a request for the draft RFP and a current, completed and certified DD Form 2345 with their request to NAWCAD Lakehurst Contracts Office , Attn: C. Montgomery (fax number (732) 323-7408  or  (732) 323-4069.

Questions and comments can be directed to Carol A. Montgomery @ (732) 323-2812.  Email - Carol.Montgomery@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 235910   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This request for quotation number RFQ-OH-03-00062 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  This is a total small business set-aside; NAICS code 235910.  The size standard is $11.5  million.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for well drilling services at Loring Air Force Base in Linestone Maine.  The services shall include:  (1)  Drill, eight (8) cored boreholes, each approximately 100 ft. in depth using diamong core NQ-3 or NQ double tube wireline  drilling techniques.  The boreholes will be drilled in an area of approximately 100 ft. by 100 ft.  The area is accessible by a truck mounted drilling rig and a pressurized water supply (fire hydrant) is located approximately 500 ft. away.  The Project Officer will provide boxes for the cores; (2)   Obtain approximately 100 rock chip samples from fracture surfaces or of the matrix that meet the following Rock Chip Sample Extraction Procedure:  A modification of EPA Method 5035 will be used to extract the bedrock samples collected in the field.  Method 5035 lists different procedures for  processing samples that are expected to contain low concentrations (0.5 to 200  g/kg) or high concentrations (>200  g/kg) of VOCs.  Procedures for high levels of VOCs will be used in the field because those procedures will facilitate the processing of large volume sample cores collected during  bedrock sampling. The procedure previously used during the Phase I site characterization study and to be used here is based on collecting approximately 50 to 80 grams (g) of rock chips in a pre-weighed eight ounce (oz) wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100 mL of methanol will then be added to  the glass jar.  The rock chips will be of a size and shape that will allow them to be completely immersed in the methanol.  The following is the procedure that will be used in the field: 	*The 50 to 80 g of rock chips will be placed in a pre-weighed 8 oz. wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100  mL of reagent grade methanol will then be added to the glass jar.  After capping, the glass jar will be weighed again with a top-loading balance (to nearest 0.01 gram) and marked with the location ID, sample interval, and date and time the sample was collected. 	*The glass jar filled with methanol  and rock chips will then be stored at 4  C for seven days while the extraction takes place. 	*Methanol extract will then be decanted into a 20-mL glass volatile organic analysis (VOA) vial and a 40-mL glass VOA vial (to be archived) using a 10-mL disposable pipette.  The 20-mL glass VOA vials  containing the extract will be capped, labeled, and stored at 4  C until they are shipped in a cooler with ice to the laboratory.  The 40-mL VOA vials will be stored in a refrigerator and archived on site until the analytical data has been approved by EPA.       (3)  Package the methanol  samples in plastic coolers packed with ice suitable for shipment to the U.S. EPA. .  Each cooler shall include a chain of custody.  The U.S. EPA Project Officer will be at the site at the time of the drilling/sampling to receive the samples from the contractor and to provide consultation as to the  exact location of the holes to be drilled and the cores to be sampled.  The contractor shall complete the drilling and sampling within 30 days of purchase order award.  The following provisions apply:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and  Conditions?Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include the following past  performance information:  three (3) references for which similar services have been provided; the name and telephone number of a contact person for each reference; contract number, description and dollar value of the services.  Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror with an acceptable  record of past per formance.  The full text of the clauses referenced above can be found at:  www. arnet.gov/far.

The services shall include:   (1)  Drill, eight (8) cored boreholes, each approximately 100 ft. in depth using diamong core NQ-3 or NQ double tube wireline drilling techniques.  The boreholes will be drilled in an area of approximately 100 ft. by 100 ft.  The area is accessible by a truck mounted drilling rig and a pressurized  water supply (fire hydrant) is located approximately 500 ft. away.  The Project Officer will provide boxes for the cores; (2)  Obtain approximately 100 rock chip samples from fracture surfaces or of the matrix that meet the following Rock Chip Sample Extraction Procedure:  A modification of EPA  Method 5035 will be used to extract the bedrock samples collected in the field.  Method 5035 lists different procedures for processing samples that are expected to contain low concentrations (0.5 to 200  g/kg) or high concentrations (>200  g/kg) of VOCs.  Procedures for high levels of VOCs will be  used in the field because those procedures will facilitate the processing of large volume sample cores collected during bedrock sampling. The procedure previously used during the Phase I site characterization study and to be used here is based on collecting approximately 50 to 80 grams (g) of rock  chips in a pre-weighed eight ounce (oz) wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100 mL of methanol will then be added to the glass jar.  The rock chips will be of a size and shape that will allow them to be completely immersed in the methanol.  The following is the procedure that will be used in the  field: 	*The 50 to 80 g of rock chips will be placed in a pre-weighed 8 oz. wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100 mL of reagent grade methanol will then be added to the glass jar.  After capping, the glass jar will be weighed again with a top-loading balance (to nearest 0.01 gram) and marked  with the location ID, sample interval, and date and time the sample was collected. 	*The glass jar filled with methanol and rock chips will then be stored at 4  C for seven days while the extraction takes place. 	*Methanol extract will then be decanted into a 20-mL glass volatile organic analysis  (VOA) vial and a 40-mL glass VOA vial (to be archived) using a 10-mL disposable pipette.  The 20-mL glass VOA vials containing the extract will be capped, labeled, and stored at 4  C until they are shipped in a cooler with ice to the laboratory.  The 40-mL VOA vials will be stored in a refrigerator  and archived on site until the analytical data has been approved by EPA.       (3)  Package the methanol samples in plastic coolers packed with ice suitable for shipment to the U.S. EPA. .  Each cooler shall include a chain of custody.  The U.S. EPA Project Officer will be at the site at the  time of the drilling/sampling to receive the samples from the contractor and to provide consultation as to the exact location of the holes to be drilled and the cores to be sampled.  The contractor shall complete the drilling and sampling within 30 days of purchase order award.  The following  provisions apply:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include the following past performance information:  three (3) references for which similar services have been provided; the name and telephone number of a contact person for each reference; contract number, description and  dollar value of the services.  Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror with an acceptable record of past per formance.  The full text of the clauses referenced above can be found at:  www. arnet.gov/far.  Questions should be sent via email to Sandy Savage at savage.sandra@epa.gov.  The due  date for quotes is May 5, 2003 at 3:00 p.m. EDT.

<DESC>Seeking expressions of interest to build-lease an annex office building for the United States Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia:

The Untied States Government (USG) is seeking expressions on interest from Developers for the construction and lease to the USG of Commercial Office space to be used as an Annex Office Building in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  The amount of office space needed is approximately 6900 net square meters (i.e. amount of usable space).  The building's finish and location should be appropriate for the Diplomatic function it serves.  The building should also be in very close proximity to the existing Embassy.  Our objective is to have the building completed and ready for occupancy as soon as possible.  The lease will provide that the USG pay the developer an Annual rent during the term of the Lease.  The term of the Lease will be for approximately 10 years and will be renewable for additional terms to be negotiated.  The Build-Lease Agreement will be negotiated and executed with the successful developer and will contain preliminary floor plans, site plans, specifications and elevations.  The final plans will then be agreed upon, completed and become part of the Build-Lease Agreement.  Aside from the rent, which will not commence until the Building is complete, the USG will provide no funding for design or construction.  The developer will provide all monies necessary for the Development and long-term ownership of the property.  The Lease will also have an option for the USG to purchase the property.

Please note that the developer will be required to identify its proposed building and/or site at the time the proposal is submitted.  If a proposal is selected, the developer will be given an opportunity to demonstrate that it can acquire the needed property within a time frame acceptable to the USG.

If you are interested in providing the Build-Lease Annex described herein, please submit to the United States Embassy, Entoto Road, P.O.box 1014, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Attn: Eva J. Groening, Administrative Counselor, a letter expressing your interest, requesting a proposal package and including the required information outlined below.  All expressions of interest must be received by 4 p.m., Local Time, on  May 19, 2003.  Expressions of interest must be submitted in English.  The USG will provide those it deems qualified with a proposal package.

In order to be considered, expressions of interest must include information on the following:

(1).	Firm Background:  Please provide the name, street address and contact information for the developer and anyone who has an ownership interest in such developer.  Please also demonstrate that the developer has successfully completed projects of similar size and scope within similar time frames.

Photos and brochures of the firm and your projects are helpful.  Please also provide evidence of your financial status and ability to obtain sufficient financing to complete the Project. 

(2).	Proposed Site/Building:  If you have already identified possible sites upon which you might locate the Build-Lease Annex, please provide us with the street address and a map showing the property location.  If you have it available, please also include any photos, surveys, site plans or drawings that show the size, location and layout of the property and the proposed building.

(3).	American-Owned Bidders:  If you want to be eligible for a 10% preference that might be available under 22 U.S.C.  302 to “American-Owned” bidders, please provide evidence of (a) performance of similar construction work in the United States, and (b) either (i) ownership in excess of fifty percent by United States citizens or permanent residence, or (ii) incorporation in the United States for more than three years and employment of United States citizens or permanent residents in more than half of the corporation’s permanent full-time professional and managerial positions in the United States.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Create a Blue Ribbon Panel Solicitation number 4200008022 which was posted on 04/01/03. You are notified that the following changes are made: Revised Statement of Work NASA's Office of Education has a requirement to contract for an outside company/organization to form a "Blue Ribbon Panel."   The Panel's purpose is to develop criteria with which to evaluate job applicants for Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" educators. The "Blue Ribbon Panel" should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community.	Those members should include representatives from the teaching profession (K-12, higher education, and informal education) and professional education associations. K-12 educators are our primary focus.	The product the panel develops must define characteristics of a superior educator and provide types of evidence that one would expect to see in a job application that would demonstrate a high level possession of those characteristics.  The characteristics of a superior educator may be described in terms of competencies, knowledge, skills, abilities and personal traits and other similar attributes.  The evidence that a job candidate possesses these characteristics should be defined in terms of types of educator work experience, extracurricular activities, teaching or educator accomplishments, awards and other similar recognitions, or other quantitative achievement.  The anticipated period of performance for this effort is 5 weeks from award. Evaluation Criteria Proposals will be evaluated based on a combination of technical and price.  Adjectival ratings ranging from excellent to poor will be used in the evaluation of proposals.  Award will be made to that offeror that represents the best value to the Government.  1.  The Offeror's technical approach will be evaluated on its efficiency, effectiveness, clarity and completeness in fulfilling the requirements contained in the Statement of Work.  2.  The Government's anticipated budget for this effort will not exceed $100,000.  Offerors will be evaluated on their ability to fulfill the requirements within the anticipated budget. 3.  Proposals will be evaluated on the offeror's ability to demonstrate that they can convene a diverse panel of education professionals.   4.	Proposals will be evaluated on the offeror's approach to developing the criteria.  Criteria should be based on credible sources.   Below are responses to the questions submitted thus far: Q: Could you tell me if the solicitation will be looking for a company to find and set up a blue ribbon panel, or are you simply looking for individual panel members? A:  The solicitation NASA will issue, seeks a contractor to form the "Blue Ribbon Panel."    The contractor selected will be responsible for setting up the panel and delivering the product of the panel to NASA. Q:  Would a not-for-profit organization be eligible to compete for this (once the solicitation is released)? A:  Procurement will need to provide the response to this question. Q:  I need some direction on what to do next. A:  The solicitation NASA will issue seeks  a contractor to form the "Blue Ribbon Panel."  The contractor selected will be responsible for setting up the panel and delivering the product to NASA.  The expected product of the Blue Ribbon Panel is criteria with which to evaluate job applicants for the Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" applicants.  This criteria will be used by another panel of subject matter experts in their evaluation of the applicants. If you are interested in submitting a proposal, (procurement should add what the process for proposal submission is here).	Q:  Are you looking for one organization to accomplish your goal? A: NASA seeks a contractor to take on the responsibility of forming the "Blue Ribbon Panel."	The panel that is formed by the contractor should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community, who will develop criteria which NASA will use to evaluate job applicants for Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" educators. Q:  Must the people on the panel be an educator? A:  The "Blue Ribbon Panel" should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community.  It may include, but is not limited to representatives from both the teaching profession and professional education associations.   Q:  Regarding the RFQ for the Blue Ribbon Panel for Educator Astronaut Positions, what is the status of an HBCU in this small business set aside? A:  HBCU does not qualify under a small business set-aside. The due date for responses is not extended.

<DESC>NA The project work consists of dredging portions of Key West Harbor, including the Main Ship Channel, Cut-A, Cut-A Widener, Cut-B, Cut-C, Cut-C Turning Basin, and Truman Harbor. The final dredging depths have not yet been determined; however, the deepest dre dging scenario under consideration is a required depth of 37 feet with an allowable overdepth of 1 foot. Under this scenario, the total amount of material to be dredged would be approximately 1.5 million cubic yards. The general types of material expected to be encountered are silt, sand, and rock. Under the 37-foot plus 1-foot scenario, the expected proportion of rock could approach 40%. Under shallower dredging depth scenarios, the expected proportion of rock would be less. Drilling and blasting of rock w ill not be allowed under this contract. The final disposal area details have not yet been determined. In general, however, the disposal area will be located adjacent to the northern shore of Rockland Key. Maximum distances from the dredging area to the dis posal area will be on the order of 15 miles. An approved pipeline corridor (water route portion as well as overland portion) will be available to the contractor for placement of dredge pipe. The contractor should expect that close coordination with environ mental agencies will be required when placing pipeline within the approved corridor so that impacts to environmental resources can be avoided. The placement of dredged material may involve the partial filling of deep (underwater) borrow pits. It may also i nvolve an upland site or sites provided for the purpose of dredged material disposal. The contractor will be expected to include a method and design for upland containment on the provided site or sites(s) as part of his proposal for this project. In genera l, the contractor should expect that a high degree of environmental sensitivity will be required of him by this contract. This same level of sensitivity will be expected by the environmental community, which will be diligently watching the contractor’s ope rations, especially with regard to turbidity. In particular, the contractor should expect to work with restrictions such as areas of no access, areas where anchor placement is not allowed, and special requirements regarding the use of anchor cables, swing cables, mooring lines, etc. The latest hydrographic survey (including sub-bottom profile data and side scan sonar images) is available at the following web site: http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/conops/navigation/surveys/hydro.ht This Request for Information (RFI) is a market research to determine whether there is enough interest and market capabilities to go forward. If there is sufficient interest, the Jacksonville District intends to advertise this work under a Request for Proposal (RFP) in July with closin g in August, 2003. The RFP will be issued as an unrestricted procurement. CONCERNING THIS RFI, DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA, ONLY A STATEMENT OF YOUR INTEREST. If you are interested in an advertisement for this work, mailed o r faxed your response, indicating your interest, no later than 25 April 2003: (FAX NUMBER 904-232-2748), or written responses to: USAED, Jacksonville District, ATTN: CESAJ-CT-C (Deidra Cox), Prudential Office Building, 701 San Marco Boulevard, 5th Floor Ea st, Attn: CESAJ-CT-C, Cox, Cube 327, Jacksonville, FL 32207.

<CONTACT>Brenda Wendling, (609)485-5153
<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 - The following amendment is maded to this announcement:  Paragraph number 6, "the Government estimates a total contract ceiling of 133,536 hours". In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.1.3.12, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry that the FAA intends to contract, in an amount greater than $100,000. The Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, is seeking to award a competitive contract to provide continuing technical engineering support for the Surface Movement Advisor Free Flight (SMA Free Flight) Program.   Background:   SMA Free Flight is currently deployed in 16 airports throughout the country.  The SMA, used by the airlines, improves airport surface operations by providing Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) and airport ramp control personnel with near real-time aircraft position data and estimated time-to-touchdown information for arrivals in the terminal area.  It is currently anticipated that the SMA system will be expanded to at least 12 additional field sites. The objective of the proposed contract is to perform continued SMA support activities including system software and hardware maintenance updates and engineering.  Because SMA maintenance tends to be of a highly visible nature, and requires direct involvement with the airline industry, it is extremely critical that maintenance support is acquired without impacting scheduled engineering and operational activities.  This maintenance also includes 2nd level field support including a Help-Desk operation to respond to all SMA concerns and issues. Systems currently included in, and/or, affected by the work effort, are as follows: SMA ARTSIIIE (Automated Radar Terminal System) AGW (ARTS Gateway) system      interface Volpe NTSC (Volpe National Transportation System Center) SMA FFP1 Server SMA STARS (Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System) AIG system     interface SMA ARTSIIIA ODS (Optical Disk Subsystem) interface SMA Atlanta Prototype SF-21 Interface (Safe Flight 21) AMASS/TAIU Interface (Airport Movement Area Safety System/Terminal Automation     Interface Unit) The period of performance of the contract will be for 5 years, and the Government estimates a total contract ceiling of 133,536 hours.  The contract type to be awarded will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Time and Material or Labor Hour Delivery Orders.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The NAICS code for this requirement will be 541330 (Engineering Services).   Small business size standard is $4.0 million in annual receipts.  Award will be based on Best Value evaluation.  Technical abilities will be considered more important than cost, with the highest emphasis being placed on direct SMA experience. Companies interested in receiving a solicitation package and submitting a proposal for these services may submit a written request via mail, e-mail, or facsimile.  The request must state the solicitation number, DTFACT-03-R00009, the title, Surface Movement Advisor (SMA) Maintenance and Engineering Services, and that it is a request for a solicitation package.  It shall also contain the company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.  Since the solicitation will be issued electronically, it is essential that the e-mail address be included.  An e-mail submission is preferred over a hard copy or facsimile request.  Address request to the Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Ms. Brenda Wendling, ACX-51, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405.  The fax number is: (609)-485-4088.  The e-mail address is: Brenda.wendling@faa.gov .   No telephonic requests will be honored. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the request for offers, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. A screening information request is anticipated within 30-60 days of this announcemen

<DESC>NAVAIR Lakehurst plans to issue Request for Proposal N68335-03-R-0015 on or about 3 July 2003.  This formal solicitation is the follow-up to draft solicitation N68335-03-R-0015, synopsized on 16 Dec 2002, (Submission Number 1/63022) and released on  21 March 2003 for the Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD)  Phase of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS).  

EMALS will be the catapult system for the CVN aircraft carrier class.  The Navy defines EMALS as four major subsystems:  1)  Energy Storage, 2) Power Conditioning,  3) Launch Motor and 4) Launch Control. The program goal for the SDD phase is to deliver a fully tested shipboard representative catapult for development test and evaluation and fleet operational assessment.  Installation will be at the Lakehurst, NJ facility.   

This procurement is considered a multi-phase acquisition. The first phase of this program was the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase synopsized in July 1999 (Submission No. 349470), and awarded to both General Atomics of San Diego, California and Northrop Grumman of Sunnyvale, California in December of 1999. 

This  requirement is for the next phase of the procurement.  Competition for the SDD phase will build on results from the PDRR phase, and the award criteria for the SDD phase will include successful completion of various PDRR requirements.  Accordingly, NAVAIR anticipates that only the PDRR contractors will be capable of successfully competing for this phase, under an approved Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition. A down selection between General Atomics and Northrop Grumman  will determine the SDD phase awardee.

Any other responsible source may also submit a proposal for the SDD phase, however, to be considered for SDD award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the awardees under the PDRR phase.  Such demonstration includes the following PDRR phase deliverables: 1) Full Scale, Reduced Length, Fully Integrated EMALS Prototype hardware and software and its associated Detailed Design Package, 2) a Test and Evaluation Report detailing performed tests and test results that indicate the ability to meet the requirements of the EMALS Operational Capabilities Document, 3) an EMALS Specification and  4) a Conceptual Shipboard EMALS Design Package.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.   

Proposals in response to the solicitation will be due 60 days thereafter.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website at WWW. NAVAIR.NAVY.MIL.   A Best Value method of evaluation will be utilized to select the single awardee.  A cost plus award fee type contract is anticipated.  

The subject RFP contains data subject to Export Control regulations and this data will only be released to firms, upon written request, who are certified with the DLSC for receipt of militarily critical technical data.  See Note 8.  

Expressions of interest should be directed to Ms. Carol A. Montgomery by phone @732 323-2812, or by email @ carol.Montgomery@navy.mil

<DESC>NA The Program Manager's Office of Light Armored Vehicles (PMO LAV), located in Warren, Michigan, is seeking potential sources and requests information related to the development and production of a proposed safety measure to minimize the effects of a vehicle  rollover for all LAV variants.  The roller over safety measure shall protect the vehicle and all personnel in the vehicle from harm during a vehicle roll over event.  The proposed rollover safety measure shall not exceed 200 lbs; and shall not adversely i mpact transportability on the Military Aircraft C-130 and C-141,  and on the CH-53 Heavy Lift Helicopter, and on the amphibious transport vessel known as the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC).  The proposed rollover safety measure shall not impede the ingre ss or egress of the driver, the vehicle commander, and all other personnel.  The Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) consists of 7 variants for a total of approximately 771 vehicles.    This Sources Sought Market Survey is for planning and informational purposes only and is not a request for proposal, nor is it a guarantee that a contract will result from this effort, and is, therefore, not to be construed as a commitment by the Governmen t.  Responses to this Sources Sought Market Survey shall include detailed information about solutions; including a detailed technical description, National Stock Number (NSN) if available, Part Numbers (PNs), estimated cost per variant (if applicable), etc .  The respondents are encouraged to provide estimated cost and schedule to develop prototype safety kit(s) and to install the kit(s) on the respective test vehicle.  The safety measure shall provide as much commonality among the vehicles as possible.  If a different safety measure is necessary for two or more variants, each variant shall require a prototype and testing on the vehicle.  In addition to the prototype information, the respondents are also encouraged to submit estimated cost and schedule to upg rade the fleet of approximately 771 LAVs.   The responses should also identify any previous contracts (include contract number/Gov't POC & phone number/dollar amount/program description, etc).   All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this announcement, however, indicat e the business size with your responses.    Detailed vehicle accident reports, vehicle technical data, and access to vehicle(s) will be available to viable respondents upon request.

<CONTACT>Mrs. Karen Thompson, Contract Specialist, (973) 724-3638
<DESC>This notice serves as a Sources Sought Notice/Market Survey for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an  obligation on the part of the Government. There is no solicitation and no  further information is available at this time. There will be no contract as a  result of this Market Survey and the Government does not intend to pay for  information received. The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to solicit Concept  Analysis Engineering Systems (CAES) Inc., Flintstone, MD on a sole source basis  for R&D Composite Cannon Launched Munition and Weapon Component Prototype  Support for the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC PGM Programs. The Government requires the  contractor to have an extensive experience base and capabilities in the  development of high performance components for munitions, weapons and aerospace  applications. The contractor must demonstrate capabilities and an extensive  experience base in analysis, design, and manufacturing methods for development  of the airframe, sabot, obturator, warhead dispense, aerodynamic control  surfaces, linkage mechanisms for steering the projectile, high strength  composite weapon components, propelling charge development, and cannon launched  rocket propulsion technologies. Specifically, the contractor must possess  capabilities and analytical tools required for development of high performance  munitions and cannon tubes incorporating advanced technology composite  materials and propulsion methods. The high performance artillery munitions  concepts require use of thick sectioned laminated composite materials capable  of sustaining the dynamic loads and high temperature exposure associated with  gun launch rocket assisted conditions.  The contractor must demonstrate  capabilities for three dimensional (3D) laminated composite design and analysis  modeling capable of resolving manufacturing, design geometry, and structural- thermal effects on a detailed ply-by-ply basis for 3D applications.  This  analytical capability is necessary for successful development of high  performance munitions because of the stringent demands imposed by the need to  minimize parasitic weights using advanced fibers and matrix materials while  achieving required performance in primary structural components and at  component interfaces where composite materials inherently require special  design and manufacturing techniques to accommodate their unique non-isotropic  behavior, particularly in thick layered sections.  The contractor’s design and  analysis codes must demonstrate capabilities for evaluating alternate laminated  composite design configurations as candidate approaches to be considered for  structural and thermal adequacy and with due regard for the effects imposed by  the manufacturing methods used with the 3D geometries involved. Results from  these analytical evaluations will be used as an accurate guide for selecting  the highest pay-off design approach for the materials to be incorporated, and  the manufacturing methods and tools to be employed in achieving demonstrated  technical goals with minimal development risk. The contractor must demonstrate  capabilities and an extensive experience base in analysis, design, and  manufacturing methods, and successfully incorporating composite reinforcement  over-wrapped on a thin-walled steel liner, which withstands the operating  pressure environment of large caliber artillery cannon tubes.  These  capabilities must demonstrate application of enabling technologies that include  yielding member straightening of the post-machined thin metal liner forging;  variable thick section composite hoop and axial reinforcement thickness profile  and laminate stacking sequencing to achieve optimal gun tube strength and  stiffness at minimum weight; liner and composite thickness distributions  achieving required thermal management at optimum stiffness and strength; and  swage auto-frettage techniques to achieve a fatigue resistant integrated liner- composite structure in the post-cured gun tube assembly. The contractor must  demonstrate capabilities and an extensive experience base in analysis, design,  formulation, mixing, testing and manufacturing methods for development of  cannon launched rocket motors and propellants, artillery and rifle propellant  charges, traveling propellant charges, lethal mechanisms, warheads and  explosives, and initiation charge technologies. The contractor must possess all  he aforementioned capabilities and an experience base including lightweight  artillery projectiles, electro magnetic gun launched hypervelocity projectiles,  lightweight gun systems, gun launched rocket assisted projectiles (RAP) and  kinetic energy (KE) projectiles, composite over wrapped pressure vessels,  composite cannon caliber gun tubes, composite flywheel rotors and armatures,  composite support structures, and the analysis and design methods development  for 3D applications of laminated composite materials and manufacture. Responses  should include contractor capabilities, past experience, and any other relevant  supporting information, including any data that may exist. Interested firms are  invited to submit responses, either electronically or via hard copy, NO LATER  THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS ANNOUCEMENT to the following address: Mrs.  Karen Thompson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, AMSTA-AQ-APA,  Building 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<RESPDATE>050903
<CONTACT>ROBERT RYAN 812-854-1463
<DESC>Synopsis and Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis. The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane is seeking sources for a Ready-to Fly Airborne Target Drone that can be used in the training of Low Altitude Air Defense systems. The Drone must be self propelled, fully controllable, and capable of being taken off or otherwise launched and recovered over typical range terrain having little or no surface preparation. They must be of a size and configuration as to be easily visible by the unaided eye at a distance of 2000 meters. Finally, they must incorporate some system of Infrared augmentation to aid in the heat-seeking surface-to-air missile’s acquisition of the target. Method of propulsion is optional; however, alcohol glow ignition engines are not suitable for this application. Control may be by conventional piloted radio control system, by programmable on-board autopi lot, or by pre-programmed GPS tracking system. Other reliable control systems may also be proposed. Take off and recovery may be by affixed undercarriage or by mechanical launching mechanism. Hand launching is not acceptable. The design should be such that the visibility is optimal in the side view. Smoke or other visibility enhancements may be installed to aid in visual recognition and tracking. Infrared augmentation may be pyrotechnic, electric, or fuel-sourced. It must reliably operate at all target airspeeds and for a duration meeting or exceeding the target’s endurance limit. Information regarding manufacturers’ target drones submitted in response to this RFI must satisfy the General Requirements listed above and, at a minimum, meet all of the following outlined threshold performance criteria. 1). Cruise Speed: SLOW – 30 to 50 MPH cruise, MEDIUM – 50 to 100 MPH cruise, and  HIGH SPEED - >100 MPH cruise. Take off and landing speeds must be as slow as possible but commensurate with cruise speed requirements. 2). Endurance Limit – All Targets must be capable of remaining airborne for a minimum of 30 minutes at cruise speed. 3). Minimum Control Range – 2.0 Miles. 4). Minimum Operating Ceiling – 3,000 feet AGL. The target drones sought should be capable of being broken down into reasonably sized pieces for economical packaging and shipping, yet also capable of quick and easy field assembly using common hand tools. Field support should require a crew of no more than 3 personnel for assembly, preparation for flight, and controlling of the airborne targets. Availability information along with pricing information should be provided. OEM’s submitting information should break out pricing for purchases of units in lots of 1(prototype), 10, 20 or 40. Any one- time tooling cost estimates, if applicable, should be included. Interested vendors should provide information along with technical questions regarding this announcement to Ryan Roberts via email at roberts_ryan@crane.navy.mil or mail: NSWC Crane, Attn. Ryan Roberts, Code 1164, Bldg. 64, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522. All information must be received by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 09 May 2003. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. The Government is only seeking possible sources for future needs. No solicitation document exists at this time. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking commercial prototype level Explosive Detection Portals capable of screening personnel for trace amounts of explosives. This market survey solicits those vendors who are developing, or have developed, portal equipment manufactured for the purpose of detecting trace amounts of explosive compounds on individuals. This solicitation is for information that fully explains the existing technology features/capabilities in terms of detection, detection speed, reliability, and discrimination from commonly occurring compounds in the background environment. In the future, NAVEODTECHDIV expects to select Explosive Detection Portals for test and evaluation as required by Anti-Terrorism/Physical Security/Force Protection organizations across the Department of Defense (DOD) using this information. Test and evalu ation results of vendor systems will be collected to provide DOD users a comprehensive explanation of equipment/system capabilities in meeting DOD requirements.  NAVEODTECHDIV is specifically seeking technologies of explosive detection that protect the force and prevent terrorist activities against military personnel, equipment and military installations by finding trace amounts of explosive compounds on individuals and their personal articles at points of entry. Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find traces of explosive compounds effectively and reliably while pre-screening individuals for authorized entrance at military installations without slowing throughput by more than 15%.  NAVEODTECHDIV request that any party interested provide: a) an Equipment Technical Summary of five or fewer pages and b) a writ ten summary of two pages for their explosive portals. Format of submission is at the vendor’s discretion; however, it must include information included in the attached Technical Summary guidance. Each submission shall be transmitted electronically and in hard copy to the below point of contact no later than 30 May 2003. Penny Lanham Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division 2008 Stump Neck Road Code: 5013J  Indian Head, Maryland 20640-5070 (301-744-6850 x280 lanham@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil Technical Summary Paper Format 1.

The two levels of success for the EDE-Portals are described as follows: 1) threshold (T) – minimally acceptable level and 2) objective (O) – desired users' goal. The degrees of success, for all EDE-Portals, in meeting the Users’ Requirements for the Measures of Performance are shown for each Performance Parameter. 2.1.1 Detect Common Explosives  2.1.1.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall successfully determine the presence of, or confirm the absence of the following explosive compounds: ANFO, C4, TNT, Black Powder, Smokeless Powder, NG, PETN, RDX, HMX, and Semtex. The determination shall be  made under the most optimal conditions in the laboratory in order to determine the best possible detection capability of the EDE-Portal in detecting the identifying compounds unique to common explosives. 2.1.1.2 Measure of Performance  The performance, of the EDE-Portals, shall be measured by optimal sensitivity for each of the selected explosive compounds that are commonly found as threat explosives. Any additional explosive compound detected by the EDE-Portal will be regarded as an asset for the Portal during performance measurements. Optimal sensitivity measures empirically the lower limit of detection for quantitative transfer of an analyte. The optimal sensitivity will confirm whether the EDE-Portal can detect the explosive compound at all and/or the lowest limit of mass that the EDE-Portal can detect under closely controlled conditions in the laboratory.  The greate st degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal being able to detect each of the explosive compounds down to the optimal sensitivity of 10 nanograms. 2.1.2 Detection Effectiveness  2.1.2.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall successfully determine the presence of (True Positives) and confirm the absence of (True Negatives) explosives for 90% (T); 99.9% (O) or more of the time in or on the object of interest, i.e. in various methods of conveyance and their payloads entering U.S. government controlled areas. The EDE-Portal shall not falsely indicate the presence of (False Positives), nor falsely confirm the absence of (False Negatives) explosives in or on the object of interest, i.e. in various methods of conveyance and their payloads entering DOD controlled areas for more than 10% (T); 2% (O) of the time.  2.1.2.2 Measures of Performance  The EDE-Por tal’s performance shall be measured by an assessment of the likelihood of: a) True Positive, b) True Negative, c) False Positive or d) False Negative for each of the six explosives that represent the likely Threats. The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal having the highest percentages of True Positives and True Negatives. True Positive and True Negative percentages indicate the likelihood that the inspector at the Point of Entry can determine the presence of and confirm the absence of explosives on personnel. The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal having the lowest percentages of False Positives and False Negatives. False Positive percentages indicate the likelihood that the inspector will experience the nuisance of false alarms by looking for explosives that are not there. False Negatives indicate the likelihood that the  inspector at the Point of entry will be unable to determine the presence of explosives on the object of interest.  The greatest degree of success, in descending order of importance, will be indicated by the EDE-Portal’s likelihood of: 1) True Positives [90% or more], 2) True Negatives [90% or more], 3) False Negatives [10% or less], and 4) False Positives [10% or less].  2.1.3 Reliability  2.1.3.1 Users' Requirements  The EDE-Portal shall successfully complete the mission to determine the presence of or confirm the absence of explosives on the method of conveyance under field conditions. This shall be accomplished without an operational mission hardware or software failure, degradation or demand on the support system for 90% (T); 99% (O) of the time that the method of conveyance requires inspection.  2.1.3.2 Measures of Performance  The EDE-Portal’s performance s hall be measured by the following: a) Operational Readiness and b) Lifetime of Expendables for all ten threat explosives under field conditions and in the laboratory.  The highest operationally ready rate and the lack of unusual expendables indicates the greatest degree of success of the EDE-Portal’s performance. 2.1.3.2.1 Operational Readiness  Operational Readiness measures empirically the likelihood that the EDE-Portal will complete its mission without an operational mission failure for all objects/personnel requiring screening.  Operational Readiness will indicate the likelihood that the EDE-Portal will complete its mission without an operational mission failure by determining the number of times the EDE-Portal completed the operational mission without an operational failure divided by the number of times that the EDE-Portal was required to perform the operational mis sion.  2.1.3.2.2 Lifetime of Expendables  The Lifetime of Expendables measures empirically the degree that the EDE-Portal consumes expendable items in order to complete its mission.  Lifetime of Expendables determines if there is an unusual need for expendable items beyond the basic inventory accompanying the EDE-Portal. 2.1.4 Discriminates from Interferants (Interferants Cause False Positives) 2.1.4.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall successfully confirm the absence of explosives for 90% (T), 99.9% (O) (True Negatives) or more of the time despite the presence of several common interferants that are commonly present within the operational and environmental conditions at the Point of Entry. The ability of the EDE-Portal to distinguish between background signals and explosives will reduce the likelihood of False Positives and unnecessary additional inspecti ons. 2.1.4.2 Measure of Performance  The performance, of the EDE-Portals, shall be measured by determining their abilities to isolate and discern the differences between the following: a) their intrinsic library of recognized signals for explosives and b) the signals generated by each of the commonly occurring interferants that are presented under closely controlled laboratory conditions. Discriminates from interferants will determine which of the commonly occurring compounds introduced to the EDE-Portal will generate False Positives.  The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal not generating a False Positive for any of the interferants. 2.1.5 Rapid Screening  2.1.5.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall successfully complete the inspection operations to determine the presence of or confirm the absence of an explosive in or on the meth od of conveyance under field conditions. This shall be accomplished without degrading the hourly rate of normal throughput operations by more than 15% (T); 2% (O) due to detection operations.  Detection operations include the following: preparation of the method of conveyance for inspection, sample collection, EDE-Portal sensor processing and signal analysis, and double clear of the EDE-Portal in preparation for the next inspection.  	2.1.5.2 Measures of Performance  	The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by an assessment of the time to perform the following: a) Inspection - 69 seconds or less and b) Reexamine - 104 seconds or less for all methods of conveyance under field conditions. The baseline standards for the Military Working Dog were an inspection time of 60 seconds and a reexamine time of 90 seconds per article of inspection. The greatest degree of succes s will be indicated by the EDE-Portal having the shortest inspection and reexamination times for all methods of conveyance. Note: Inspections that are deemed to be operational failures, i. e. exceeded 15 minutes of inspection time, will be excluded from determining the average times. 2.1.5.2.1 Inspection Time  Inspection Time measures empirically the average time of the detection operation on inert threat test articles. Inspection Time is important to throughput time because it provides the time needed by the EDE-Portal to inspect most methods of conveyance that do not have explosives.  2.1.5.2.2 Reexamine Time (field)  Reexamine Time measures empirically the average time of the detection operation on explosive threat test articles. Reexamine Time is the time needed by the EDE-Portal to recover from the first reading of a live explosive on or in the method of convey ance so that the inspector may verify the validity of his first reading. 2.1.6 Transportability  2.1.6.1 Users’ Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall meet the weight and size standards for transporting the EDE-Portal to the Point of Entry  2.1.6.2 Measures of Performance   The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by the number of individuals or excess equipment that will be required to transport and hoist the EDE-Portal into place at the Point of Entry. In addition, the performance shall be measured for the ability of the EDE-Portal (disassembled) to transverse a standard size (34-inch wide x 76-inch high) door. 2.1.7 Power  2.1.7.1 Users' Requirement   The EDE-Portal shall successfully operate to determine the presence of, or confirm the absence of an explosive compound under field conditions for 24 continuous hours from cold startup. The EDE-Port al shall be operated by AC (110-240V 50-60Hz) power source and have the capability of operating on battery power in order to minimize disruption to the throughput of inspection operations at the Point of Entry. 2.1.7.2 Measure of Performance  The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by the degree of simplicity required to connect to an existing power source at Point of Entry, by the availability of battery backup in the event of power failure, and by the continuous extent of operation.  2.1.8 Masking Agent (Masking Agents Cause False Negatives) 2.1.8.1 Users' Requirement The EDE-Portal shall successfully determine the presence of explosives for 90% (T), 99.9% (O) (True Positives) or more of the time. This shall be accomplished despite the presence of several common Masking Agents that are commonly present within the operational and environmental conditions  at the Point of Entry. The ability to distinguish between target explosives and background signals will reduce the likelihood of False Negatives and potentially allowing explosives into the DOD controlled area.  2.1.8.2 Measures of Performance  The performance of the EDE-Portals shall be measured by determining their abilities to isolate and discern the differences between the following: a) their intrinsic library of target explosive compounds and b) each of the common Masking Agents that are presented under closely controlled laboratory conditions. Masking Agents will determine which of the commonly occurring compounds introduced to the EDE-Portal will generate False Negatives.  The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal not generating a False Negative for any of the ten Masking Agents. 2.1.9 Alarms  2.1.9.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Po rtal shall be capable of alerting the operator visually or audibly to the presence of explosives. This shall be accomplished via a short, simple & transitory alert or cue to observe a crisp visual display, under field conditions, as determined by an Operator Assessment so that the inspector may decide the next appropriate physical security measure at the Point of Entry. 2.1.9.2 Measure of Performance  The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by an Operator Assessment survey administered after each EDE-Portal is used to inspect each method of conveyance containing the threat test articles. The survey summarized the requirements for Alarms from MIL-STD-1472F and specifically asked questions regarding whether the EDE-Portal has the following: 1) alarm capable of alerting the operator visually to the presence of explosives, 2) alarm that can be hidden, shielded, or obst ructed from all but the operator’s field of view so that the alarm is then covert, and only alerts the operator, 3) display that can be reviewed until cleared and not susceptible to lost data, and 4) display that is readable in all weather and time of day or night. The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal that receives the highest subjective scores from the Operator Assessment. 2.1.10 Training Package  2.1.10.1 Users' Requirement  The EDE-Portal shall include an instructional manual detailing clearly and comprehensively the proper operation and routine maintenance of the EDE-Portal in the laboratory and under field conditions. 2.1.10.2 Measure of Performance  The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by data generated in an Operator Assessment survey. Operators shall complete a survey, after operating the EDE-Portals, to determine t he degree to which the EDE-Portal meets the operations and maintenance requirements outlined in 2.1.10.1. The instructional manual shall be published in English detailing clearly and comprehensively the proper operation and routine maintenance of the EDE-Portal system to a technically qualified operator. Ideally, the Training Package would consist of self-taught training that does not exceed 16 hours on a common, interactive computer based training media, e. g. CD-ROM, zip disk, or internet link, that would prepare the operator for certification by their supervisor on the operation and maintenance of the EDE-Portal. The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal that receives the highest subjective scores from the Operator Assessment. 2.1.11 Set-up and Initial Start-up  2.1.11.1 Users' Requirement  The criteria for the EDE-Portal are under developme nt. The requirements will address the amount of time required for set-up, initial start-up and operational time, special equipment required for set-up, and the number of individuals and training required to set-up the EDE-Portal and begin operations.  2.1.11.2 Measures of Performance  The EDE-Portal’s performance shall be measured by an Operator Assessment survey that subjectively evaluates the following: a) initial set-up, b) fully operational capabilities in the laboratory and under field conditions, c) type and amount of special equipment to set-up and operate the EDE-Portal, and d) the number of individuals and any special training required to set-up and operate the EDE-Portal. Operators shall complete a survey after setting up and operating the EDE-Portals to determine the degree to which the EDE-Portal meets the requirements for initial set-up and fully operational  including the equipment and training required to accomplish all tasks. The greatest degree of success will be indicated by the EDE-Portal that receives the highest subjective scores from the Operator Assessment survey . 2.1.11.2.1 Initial Setup  Initial Setup measures empirically the amount of time required for complete set up by one person. 2.1.11.2.2 Fully Operational Fully Operational measures the subjective assessment by the operators that assess the degree to which the EDE-Portals are capable of being fully operational for 24 hours of continuous use from a "cold startup.” The EDE-Portal shall be capable of being fully operational (automatic self-diagnostic checks and self-calibration after manual activation by operator) for 24 hours of continuous use from a cold startup within 15 minutes. 2.1.11.2.3 Special Equipment  Special equipment may include such t hings as a crane for placing the EDE-Portal in place, a wheeled cart for transporting the EDE-Portal or segments of the Portal from the transport vehicle to the place of operation, or special tools for assembly and maintenance. 2.1.11.2.4 Special Training  Special training may include any training beyond that included in 2.1.10 above.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MCSC), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS) Radar Systems Program Manager is seeking information on the ability to lease (preferred), or buy an interim solution for the Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) requirement. This Radar will be used to support the USMC direct and indirect Target Acquisition and Friendly adjust fire missions on current and future Artillery Rocket, and Missile systems. The radar should be able to detect, track, and acquire ground launched targets in all terrain, weather (rain, hail, snow), and electronic attack environments. The radar should have a very low probability of false track and sufficient clutter cancellation/sub-clutter visibility to maintain full sensitivity in the presence of land, sea, insects, and urban clutter as well as ducting to the maximum instrum ented range. Track quality shall be sufficient to support counter fire missions of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), legacy artillery and follow on systems and have a maximum instrumented range to 100km (objective). The system shall interface with current command and control (AFATDS). While placement on a prime mover organic to the Marine Corps (HMMWV/5-ton/MTVR) is desired, alternative modes will be considered if submitted. The system shall be able to transit all terrain normally encountered by the USMC. Mobility shall be on par with HIMARS and all vehicles and power generation devices must operate with fuels and lubricants organic to the Marine Corps. Transportability via single C-130 sortie is desired. The equipment enclosures shall protect equipment from damage by dust, wind, salt spray, rain, and ice. The ideal candidate for this requirement will provide counter fire targeting data for the HIMARS and legacy artillery systems. Interested contractors should identify a mature/maturing, fielded system that will best meet this requirement. Contractor submittals should include a rough order of magnitude (ROM$) for leasing vs. procurement and include a ROM and terms and conditions for a contractor logistics support (CLS) package (to include spares and contract maintenance support). The period of lease (or purchase) of 2-6 complete systems will begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, and will continue for a period of 48-60 months. Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Lee Kerr, by 15 May 2003. Please submit all information to Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: CTQ2LK/Ms. Lee Kerr, 2033 Barnett Ave., Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. All hand carried deliveries (including UPS, FedEx, etc.) shall be delivered to 2079 Wharton Avenue (Daly Hall), Quantico, VA 22134. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOL ICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<SUBJECT>Maintenance, repair, and rebuilding of equipment
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks to distribute the following information to private industry concerning a new certification requirement of all companies directly engaged in non-skid applications. Beginning 1 October 2003, NAVSEA 05M1 will require certification of all companies directly engaged in U.S. Navy non-skid applications.  This requirement will apply to all new contracts for non-skid applications greater than 5,000 square feet, but will not modify existing contracts. NAVSEA has selected the SSPC-QP1 commercial certification requirement and monitoring program for non-skid paint contractors. This program evaluates the competence of contractors to perform surface preparation and industrial coating application.  Paint contractors certified under this program must demonstrate competence in management procedures, technical capability, quality control, and safety/e nvironmental compliance.  Contracting firms are evaluated through submittals and an on site audit of their operations.  No other certification will be considered.  Information on the SSPC certification program can be found at www.sspc.org. For FY04, this requirement will apply to only INCONUS and Hawaii.  NAVSEA retains the right to include these requirements in any non-skid applications started prior to the listed date above, i.e. 1 October 2003, and is planning demonstrations with available certified applicators in FY03. U.S. Government facilities and personnel including public shipyards and SUPSHIP personnel, are exempt from this certification requirement. All contractors engaged in non-skid surface preparation and application must remain certified for the duration of each contract.  Contractors shall immediately notify their appropriate Government Contracting Officer and  NAVSEA 05M of any change in certification status that occurs after contract award.  NAVSEA will send official notification to current non-skid applicators to alert them of this new requirement.  Notification will also be posted in an upcoming SSPC publication of the journal of protective coatings and linings, and on the SSPC website. All companies engaged in non-skid application on U.S. Navy ships should contact SSPC directly, at their earliest convenience, to arrange for application and audit.  SSPC can be contacted by mail at the Society for Protective Coatings, 40 24th street, 6th floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-4656, or by phone at 1-877-281-7772. Please direct any questions on this matter to Mr. Michael Evans, SEA 05M1, at 202-781-3829. *****

<OFFADD>Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, 12350 Research Parkway Code 253, Orlando, FL, 32826-3224
<SUBJECT>A -- White Paper Request for STRICOM BAA, Part I, Section 4, Test and Evaluation (T&E) Research and Development
<DESC>Test and Evaluation Research & Development. The US Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276 will initiate research in FY03 under Part I, Section 4 - Test and Evaluation Research covered by the STRICOM and Army Research Institute (ARI) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023, Amendment A001 issued in March 2001. 

Currently, the Department of Defense (DoD) Test and Evaluation (T&E) ranges rely on film based imaging systems for the recording, storage and archiving of critical weapons test data.  The Digital Video Systems Development (DVSD) program was initiated to advance and integrate telecommunications, computer system technologies, optics, sensors, cameras, tracking, archival systems, and related instrumentation associated with digital image acquisition.  The products derived from DVSD will increase the efficiency of image acquisition, analysis, distribution and archiving at DoD T&E ranges.

The BAA Announcement can be accessed via the website address: http://www.stricom.army.mil/STRICOM/BAA.  Additional reference material regarding the tri-services program may also be made available as attachments to this BAA announcement.  

Selected research areas of interest for the DVSD shall include the following:

Task 1: The objective of this study effort shall be to identify and analyze real-time objective tracking algorithms that can be implemented in the camera front end in order to improve data capture while maintaining the data integrity for post processing validation.

 The contractor shall identify algorithms that improve real-time object tracking at the imaging front end (to improve the overall quality of the data at the down-stream analysis point).  The analysis should assess the applicability of post processing techniques to improve the real-time tracking algorithms as a means of improving collected image quality. 

Task 2: The objective of this study effort shall be to investigate and analyze various compression techniques such that, if implemented, would allow the system architecture to permit high-speed transmission and storage of imagery data.  Along with a recommendation for real-time vs. non-real time implementation, a cost-benefit analysis and feasibility report should be generated to address, at a minimum, the data rates up to those listed below (for real-time compression).

The development of high speed and high-resolution digital cameras using Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)- based image sensors create a new set of data handling challenges. The amount of data generated by a high performance digital camera may prove to be the limiting factor in its practical utility unless techniques can be developed that will minimize the impact of the mass quantity of data that will be generated.  To illustrate the magnitude of the problem, Figure 1 lists examples of the approximate raw data rates from planned CMOS cameras:


Figure 1:  Representative Digital Camera Data Rates: Pixel Density 512x512, Frame Rate 5000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 12 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 512x256, Frame Rate 10000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 12 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 1024x1024, Frame Rate 1000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 8 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 1280x1024, Frame Rate 500 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 10 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 2048x2048, Frame Rate 500 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 20 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 3072x3072, Frame Rate 200 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 18 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 4096x4096, Frame Rate 200 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 32 Gbits per second.  

Figure 1 demonstrates how raw data rates generated by high performance digital cameras exceed most conventional transmission media, protocol, or storage systems. In some cases, the captured imagery data may need to be compressed in real-time with consideration to developing co-processor architecture resident with the CMOS sensor.  In other cases, compression can take place after the capture event occurs.

Examples of some of functions that may need to be considered for real-time, near real-time and non-real time compression techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Region of Interest (ROI) Change
