ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.     The POC for this acquisition is Lt Megan Spilinek (302) 677-5226, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at megan.spilinek@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc.  The requirement is to replace the eleven [11] year old LC/GC/Mass Spectrometer for the Chemistry Department at USAFA CO.  The Department of Chemistry has an important need for an ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System to meet the requirements of large molecule inorganics or organometalics, nonvolatile molecules and protein/peptide analysis in advanced chemistry courses and work being done in the chemistry research center.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry [TOF MS] was developed in the last 1940’s, but until the 1990’s, its popularity was limited.  Recent improvements in TOF technology, including orthogonal acceleration, ion mirrors [reflections], and high-speed electronics, have significantly improved TOF resolution.  This improved resolution, combined with powerful and easy-to-use electrospray [ESI] and matrix-assister laser desorption ionization [MALDI] ion sources, have made TOF MS a core technology for the analysis of both small and large molecules.  Most of the introductory organic or analytical chemistry courses work with volatile organic compounds that can easily be analyzed on Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometers [GCMS.  As chemistry courses advance into courses such as Biochemistry, Macro Biochemistry and Materials Science studies larger and more complex molecules are studied.  To work with these large molecules, a new type of sample introduction process is needed to transfer, separate and inject Liquid Chromatography [LC] into a mass spectrometer [TOF MS].  As well as being an extremely sensitive detection system [TOF MS] can separate large proteins and peptides, like RNA and DNA for example.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide a more “user friendly”, easy to maintain, and highly technological ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System that is capable of meeting the needs of the USAFA Chemistry Department, departmental teaching criteria and student ease of use requirements.  The Agilent Technologies model 1100 series ESI/MALDI/ LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  “See Note 22”.

<SOLNBR>FA8708-04-R-0002
<CONTACT>Joseph Gannon joseph.gannon@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The E8 Joint STARS Systems Group of the Electronic Systems Center is anticipating release of a sole-source solicitation to Northrop Grumman Corporation for the acquisition of a follow-on Joint STARS System Improvement Program (JSSIP) contract.  The current JSSIP contract (F19628-99-D-0001) was awarded in 1999 sole-source to Northrop Grumman Corporation and was in effect until March of 2005.  The anticipated follow-on JSSIP contract is anticipated to be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will be in effect from approximately September 2005 until September 2010.  The estimated maximum value of the follow-on contract will be approximately $532 M over the five-year ordering period.      The planned contract will include provisions for technical upgrades of the Joint STARS, including systems engineering, design, development, manufacture, installation, test and demonstrations, production and retrofit, engineering change proposals, documentation, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), logistics support and sustainment, simulations of solutions, initial operator training, warranties, and any other improvement type efforts.  In addition, the contract will include Engineering Service Tasks (ESTs) for analyses, studies, systems engineering, planning, prototyping, qualification/test, training, and flight-test infrastructure for proposed upgrades and improvements.  In addition, the upgrade of Joint STARS Trainers, Simulators and Virtual Training Networks is contemplated for added subsystems.      Based on the history of the E-8 program, the Electronic Systems Center intends to issue a Request for Proposal only to Northrop Grumman. The statutory authority to do so is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) which states the following:  "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, from DOD, NASA and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.”

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the Development and Delivery of Increment-1 of Land Command and Control Information Services (LC2IS) in Support of Land Staffs.

The Land C2 Cycle provides for the efficient and effective employment of joint Land capabilities/forces made available to NATO. It consists of a repetitive process for the planning, coordination, allocation tasking, reporting and assessment of joint Land missions (action -> reaction -> counter-action). The Cycle accommodates changing tactical or operational situations and guidance, as well as requests for support from other component commanders.

The requirement is to provide NATO staffs with software tools that will provide a secure, high speed, and reliable information flow in both static and deployed environments to support the Land C2 Cycle. It must also deliver information in an easily understood user-oriented manner for the full spectrum of NATO operations.

NC3A serves as the Host Nation for this project, which is programmed in the Capability Package at Reference 2, Provide Information System in Support of the ACE-Wide Operations Mission Area, as serial 1999/5HQ00592-0. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is IFB-CO-11715-LC2IS and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

For the performance of the contract, bidders will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance for personnel and the contractor facility, which must be in place prior to the contract award.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The project is based on the use of Spiral Development, which will be executed in three Increments of a Spiral. The spiral development approach will allow the NC3A to meet the full range of LC2IS operational requirements, but also to balance operational user priorities with technical risks, implementation costs, and development schedules in determining the scope of each increment. To reduce the probability of cost increases and schedule delays, each increment will concentrate on those requirements for which the development risks are lowest. Requirements not allocated against the current increment under development will be the subjects of parallel analysis efforts, either to refine the functional requirement or to assess the feasibility of technical solutions. The results of these studies will then be used to define the scope of the following increment.

In order to execute Spiral implementation efficiently, an industrial partner, selected on the basis of Best Value Bid Evaluation, will be offered an initial contract covering Spiral 1 including the description of the potential scope of Spirals 2 and 3. When increments 2 and 3 are authorized, they would be added to the original contract by task orders using rates and cost criteria established at the time of the original contract award provided the contractor's performance level has been satisfactory and that this arrangement is authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.

The estimated value of this resulting contract is Euro 8,500,000 (USD 10,500,000) for Spiral 1 and Euro 15,600,000 (USD 19,300,000) for the three Spirals. The funding for the first Spiral has been authorized by the document at Reference 6. Funding for Spiral 2 and Spiral 3 will be sought separately in due time through amendments to the Type B cost estimate developed for the overall project and Spiral 1 in particular.

The first spiral shall deliver an Initial Operating Capability no later than 12 months after the Effective Date of Contract (EDC) and the total Increment-1 capability within 18 months after the EDC. The Final Operating Capability for the 3 increments, including one year of Contractual Support, shall be delivered within 60 months after EDC.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

This software will constitute a component of the Bi-Strategic Command's Automated Information System Operations Functional Services (BI-SC AIS OPS FS), to be deployed on the NATO SECRET Wide Area Network (NS WAN) and installed at the various NATO Command locations.

The current Operations Support function will be the primarily users of LC2IS. The Current Operations Function Support addresses requirements across all combat and support disciplines.

The LC2IS, which will be fielded from the strategic to component command level, cannot cover the full scope of the Land C2 cycle down to the tactical level. At the land component level, national systems will also support the Land C2 process. To support the seamless, transparent, and timely flow of data and information between all C2 systems that support the Land C2 process, LC2IS must support the exchange of different types of information whose format and structure must comply with the existing NATO standards (AdatP3 V 11 F) and with the MIP DEM Block 2.

The specific functional requirements for LC2IS will permit to: 1) conduct collaborative planning of Land operations, 2) monitor and assess ongoing Land operations, 3) provide Recognized Ground Picture, (RGP) 4) enhanced Collaboration and Synchronization, and 5) provide for Multinational Integration.

This project will be conducted following a spiral development approach, with three spirals. To mitigate risks and to be able to react promptly to deviations from the Implementation Contractor, the NC3A will hire an Independent Verification and Validation Contractor to assist in the monitor and control of the implementation effort.

The project is constituted of three spirals. The scope of those spirals will be refined during a specification phase. So far it is foreseen that Increment-1 will focus on Situational Awareness and on some of the Planning concepts of the LC2IS, while Increment-2 and Increment-3 will focus on delivering the remainder of the Planning and on delivering the Plan Execution concepts. The current envisaged scope as allocated across Increments 1, 2, and 3 is outlined below. Please note that the funding authorization only addresses the implementation of Spiral or Increment-1.

Spiral/Increment-1:

Provide capability for maintaining basic OWN information (ORBAT, Force Capabilities, Equipment Capabilities);

Provide capability for maintaining basic OPFOR information (ORBAT, Force Capabilities, Equipment Capabilities, Doctrine and Tactics, Country Files, Installations);

Provide capability to support the Current Situation management (e.g., Unit Position and Combat Effectiveness, SITREP on Battlespace objects and/or events, equipment status, Supply availability, RFIs);

Provide capability to support the Assessment Process (e.g., Current Site Assessment, ASSESSREP, Ground picture +120 hrs);

Provide capability for Cross-command and Cross-J Collaboration;

Provide capability to produce and manage the OPLAN/OPORD;

Provide capability to support the Task Organization management;

Interoperability with other FS;

Interoperability with national systems.

Spiral/Increment-2:

Provide capability to support Rules of Engagement (ROE) management;

Provide capability to support the FRAGO management;

Enhance situational awareness by providing access to Common Operating Pictures (national or NATO) as available;

Provide capability to support the Deep Ops and Targeting Guidance processes;

Provide capability to support the JCO management;

Enhance capability for Cross-command and Cross-J Collaboration;

Support the Joint Targeting Working Group in the production of the Joint Target Nomination List (JTNL) and the Joint Target Prioritization List (JPTL);

Enhance Interoperability with other FS;

Enhance Interoperability with national systems.

Spiral/Increment-3:

Provide capability for war gaming effect-based operations;

Enhance situational awareness by providing access to Common Operating Pictures (national or NATO) as available;

Enhance capability for Cross-command and Cross Joint directorates Collaboration;

Enhance Interoperability with other FS;

Enhance Interoperability with national systems.

The purpose of each increment is to deliver a fielded operational capability, with lower risk, in a short period of time. To achieve this, each increment will include a common set of management, design, development, test, fielding and support activities.

FINANCIAL/LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of Euro 100,000 (USD 123,700). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12-month estimate, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

The envisaged method of bidding will be International Competitive Bidding procedures as specified in Reference 1. The evaluation of bids will be conducted in accordance with NATO Infrastructure Bidding Procedures for Best Value as set forth in the document at Reference 5.  The bid evaluation methodology to be followed, including the Top-Level evaluation criteria and their weighting factors, are as noted by the NATO Infrastructure Committee at Reference 6.

The top-level bid evaluation criteria with their associated weightings that will be used during evaluation are: Price (50%), Engineering (25%), Management (12.5%) and Supportability (12.5%). All bids, including options, will be evaluated against the criteria described above. When the evaluation is completed, the score for each bidder will be derived using the following formula: Best Value Score = E+M+S+P where E = Weighted Engineering Score, M = Weighted Management Score, S = Weighted Supportability Score, and P = Weighted Price Score. The E, M, S and P Scores will be multiplied by their respective weighting factors to produce the weighted scores. The maximum Best Value Score is 100; the minimum is zero.  

The Price Score is evaluated by the following formula: P = 80 - 20 ((Price of the Bid/Average Price of all bids) – 1), where 80 and 20 are normalization parameters to produce the linear scoring.

Bidders will be required to quote for all items, including Options and Task Orders, listed in the schedule of the Invitation for Bid. Quotations shall be on a fixed price basis for Spiral 1. It is anticipated that Options and Task Orders will be for covering, for example, additional spirals, the refinement of the software development, installation of the software, maintenance of the software, additional training courses, and support for the preparation of exercises.  

ELIGIBILITY

Interested firms must be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED.

The Generator is manufactured by Marathon Electric Manufacturing Corporation.  The Generators are used on the 100 kW and 200 kW (MEP-807A & MEP-809A) Tactical Quiet Generators (TQGs) manufactured by Engineered Electric Company DBA Fermont. D OD has also obtained these parts with the end item TQG generator sets from Fermont under their part number 0116-1120 (NSN 6115-01-520-6411) and 0116-2120 (NSN 6115-01-519-9151), CAGE 93742. DOD is interested in awarding a one time contract to purchase quan tities ranging from 2 to 10 of each Generator type. There are current sources for this item. Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of these units is not available from the Army.

<DESC>N00244 Naval Base 937 North Harbor Drive San Diego, CA Laura Maxwell 619-532-2365 This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to the authority FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii).   See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 621511. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to Myriad Genetic Laboratories to provide laboratory testing services for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  The contractor shall provide specialized testing for Comprehensive BRAC Analysis (BRAC I & BRAC2), Multi-Site 3 BRAC Analysis and Single Site BRAC Analysis (BRAC - Breast Cancer Analysis).  The contractor shall also provide reflex testing if needed, using established industry-wide laboratory protocol.  The lab must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certification and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation.  Contractor must provide own courier. Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc. specializes in providing comprehensive BRAC Analysis, a gene sequencing analysis for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer.  Myriad Genetics holds exclusive patents on BRAC I & BRAC 2 sequence testing. In this specialized area of clinical laboratory testing, Myriad Genetic Laboratories is well above the competition due to this new and advanced methodology.  All their tests are performed in-house, unlike other labs, which outsource some of the tests for analysis, extending test turnaround time and impacting the delicate nature of the disease and the overall health of the patient.  The laboratory must be located in the San Diego region to provide expedited turn-around time, and real time consultation. This lab uses the latest and most advanced gene sequencing and gene mutation methodology, allowing them to consistently provide high quality laboratory results.  Using another reference lab not fully trained or lacking the expertise in this!  field of testing is detrimental to the overall well being of the patient and quality of care.  Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the government to acquire the services and maintenance from Myriad Genetic Laboratories. The proposed contract is for a base period of one year, from 1 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 24 August 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Laura Maxwell at 619-532-4957.  Mailed documents ! will not be accepted.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only.   Solicitation N00244-05-T-0909 issued to Myriad Genetics Laboratories will be posted to www.neco.navy.mil on or about 24 August 2005.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for engineering support services for preplanned product improvement (P3I) implementation, post mission analysis (PMA) development, integration of the developmental AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), the AN/AWS-1 Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System (RAMICS) and the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) System with existing or future fleet Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and technology investigations related to improving these systems.  The period of performance will be for five years from the date of award. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. N! orthrop Grumman Corporation is the sole developer and integrator for the ALMDS, RAMICS, and COBRA systems. There is significant commonality in the hardware and design techniques between the ALMDS, RAMICS, and COBRA systems.   Additionally, there is significant commonality in the data used by these systems and the interface of resulting system data with existing C4ISR systems. The interface of the AMCM systems, implementation of P3I concepts, development of tools and tactics for PMA, and the interface with C4ISR systems requires a detailed knowledge of these specific system designs. Therefore, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to perform the required engineering studies and interface requirement definition analysis required to work these issues.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost to the Government. See Numbered Note!  22.

The Pilot Initial Plus course is required to support the UC-12B/F/M Simulator development/reconfiguration and Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) curriculum.  The UC-12 CACT Pilot and NFO program requires: Classroom (academic and practical) training, Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) for the UC-12B, UC-12F and UC-12M models that depicts all cockpit systems to be used for cockpit familiarization and differences training, a UC-12B Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), an FAA Level “C” equivalent simulator, and a C-12 (Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200) aircraft. The C-12 aircraft will be used for pre-flight inspection training and not flight training. In lieu of the PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA Level “C” equivalent or higher (as defined under the current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40) for the Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200 configured to the Navy UC-12B cockpit.  The flight simulator shall have an enhanced flight data package which provides realistic UC-12B flight characteristics and will be used in tasks that minimally include: Visual flight maneuvering, instrument navigation, transition to land, engine out work, dynamic engine cuts, full stalls, upset recovery, post stall flying characteristics, and various emergency procedures.  The simulator shall also be equipped with a collimated visual display system capable of projecting a minimum 180-degree horizontal by a 40-degree vertical field of view and simulate day-dusk-dawn-night and various seasonal weather conditions.  The visual system database shall have navigational aids and airfields as specified by the Navy to include a worldwide database of generic airfields with greater visual details and higher fidelity for the UC-12 Local Operating Areas. 

The courses must be presented at a flight-training center with a demonstrated record of providing C-12 military pilot training at the time of training.  All contractor pilot instructors shall have applicable Military C-12 Instructor Pilot experience.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabi for each course for government approval.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.

<DESC>The U.S. Navy intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) N68711-05-R-0081.  The Navy’s Geothermal Program Office, China Lake, CA, is seeking to conduct magnetotelluric surveys of two separate locations: the southeast corner of the Coso geothermal area located on the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, CA, and the Superstition Mountain area located at Naval Air Field El Centro (NAFEC), El Centro, CA.  The contractor is to conduct a number of tests at each location of electrical and magnetic sensors.  These locations will be shown in the maps that will be provided with the solicitation.  Parallel test should consist of all magnetic sensors planned to be used during the survey and as many electric field dipoles as necessary to test each acquisition channel, divided to two orthogonal groups (each group having several parallel magnetic sensors and electric dipoles) and all acquisition systems that will be used during the survey.  Data shall be acquired on multiple sites at the same time. Access to the El Centro site is facilitated due to the large number of off-road vehicle trails throughout the area.  The Contractor will be permitted to use OHV devices to transport equipment throughout the field although such movement will be confined to existing roads and trails.  Access to the China Lake site is more restricted and OHV traffic is prohibited.  Contractor vehicle activity shall be confined to existing roads (sites will be located at a minimum of 50 m from any road).  All sites will have been cleared through the environmental process at both locations prior to MT measurement activities.  Contractor shall process data to produce apparent resistivity, phase, real and imaginary components of the surface impedance, Z, and skew or some other measure of three-dimensionality.  Contractor shall use the multi-channel spectral-analysis code of Egbert, G.D. (1997, Robust multiple-station magnetotelluric data processing: Geophysical Journal International, 130, 475-496) or its equivalent.  Contractor shall prepare a logistics report detailing field acquisition activity.  Parallel test results - the MT time series, impedances, apparent resistivity, and phase data, noise estimates for each channel (electric and magnetic).  Selection of a successful offeror will be based on evaluation of the information pertaining to Past Performance, Technical Capability, Price Realism, and the Total Price.  The first two evaluation elements are listed in order of importance although they are essentially equal in weight.  The Navy intends to select the offeror that provides the best value to the Government.  This means that the lowest bidder may not be the successful party.  Cost does, however, represent approximately one-half the total evaluation.  This solicitation will be available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY.  All solicitation (or RFP) documents and solicitation amendments will be posted on the NAVFAC E-Solicitation (E-SOL) Website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil/.  The Solicitation will be posted on the E-SOL website on or about 01 September 2005.  Proposals will be due 30 days later.  It is each offeror’s responsibility to check the website for any amendments.  Interested parties are required to register for the solicitation at the NAVFAC E-Solicitation Website.  CRITICAL NOTE:  THE OFFEROR/CONTRACTOR MUST REGISTER ON THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR).  NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR.  THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227-2423 OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV.  This requirement will be 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Plasma Cleaner
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-05-821-6883

<CONTACT>Joan Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6458, Fax (301)975-8884, Email Joan.Smith@nist.gov - Michael Szwed, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-6330, Fax 301-975-8884, Email Michael.Szwed@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a plasma cleaner for the Precision Engineering Division at its Gaithersburg, Maryland campus.  Due to NIST’s requirement for sample preparation for imaging and dimensional measurements of sample at the nano-scale, it is required that NIST ensure that the surface of the sample is clean.  

In the research and development work performed at NIST, a suitable sample preparation is required for the highest resolution work for samples of the end-of-the-roadmap integrated circuit technology and for imaging and dimensional metrology of various nano-technology samples, including biological samples. NIST’s Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) is capable of resolving details down to 1 nm, but it is necessary to use clean samples to achieve this excellent resolution. 

The unit NIST proposes to procure, works with a high frequency oscillating power supply generating ion energies of less than 15 eV in a quartz plasma chamber. The vacuum system is oil-free and includes a Pirani gauge to sense vacuum level. The instrument is a self-contained unit, 23” wide x 22.25” deep x 20.25” high. The user interface is through a single control panel, which is used to initiate the vacuum, plasma, and the timer. Cleaning is accomplished in either AUTO or MANUAL mode and a process timer allows for automatic termination.  The Multiple Specimen Holder and Stand for 3 mm TEM Specimens and Multiple Specimen Holder and Port, 0.125" SEM Stubs are necessary to work with all sample holders that are in use at the SEM laboratory of the Nanoscale Metrology group. 

This is a relatively new and innovative concept for cleaning samples that preserves the details of fine structures and it works with samples for various applications in electron microscopy, especially for FESEMs.

As a result of the above, NIST intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with E.A. Fischione Instruments, Inc., Export, Pennsylvania, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c) (1) – only one responsible source.  The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price purchase order.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 22, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a noncompetitive procurement.  Written responses to this synopsis are required to contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A request for quote will not be issued.

Re: Request for Information –RFI-
Reference # 2DPSCC-05-RFI-StructuredAuthoring-


The U. S. Postal Service is seeking information regarding increases in the development and lifecycle support costs for documentation of new mail processing equipment.  Over the last decade the U.S. Postal Service’s new mail processing equipment has greatly increased in quantity, physical size, and complexity.  The corresponding increase in the quantity of the maintenance documentation, the complexity of the documentation, its various formats, and its increase in lifecycle costs has led to this Request for Information (RFI).


Attachment A provides information regarding this initiative, including minimum requirements that should be met by each responder.  Your response to this RFI must specifically discuss Attachment A requirements as they correspond to structured authoring of technical documents and creating an improved process of constructing and managing electronic maintenance documents.


This is not a prequalification and may or may not result in a solicitation. If a solicitation is issued, it shall be posted in FedBizOps. The contracting officer will notify all respondents of any determinations or findings.


We would appreciate your responses by September 7, 2005 indicating your Capabilities and ability to meet the Minimum Requirements as described in Attachment A to this RFI.


Send your responses via U.S. Mail to:

William C. Matthei, C.P.M.

Attachment A
Overview:

The United States Postal Service (USPS) Maintenance Technical Support Center (MTSC) provides maintenance documentation for mail processing equipment and building systems in various formats to approximately 40,000 maintenance employees.  MTSC seeks to accomplish two objectives as a result of this Request for Information (RFI). Firstly, MTSC desires to move to a structured authoring environment for technical publications. Secondly, MTSC desires to investigate and create an improved process of constructing electronic maintenance documentation. 

Reason for Change:

The amount and complexity of field maintenance documentation has greatly increased over the last decade due to the amount, size, and complexity of new mail processing equipment. This has caused an increase in both development and lifecycle support costs. This initiative is designed to reduce those costs, and at the same time add additional benefits in the form of quality, access, distribution, and usage.

Expected Benefits:

•	Utilizing a single data source for multiple media formats;
•	Greater control and consistency in formatting;
•	Time savings in formatting;
•	Flexibility in publishing electronic documents;
•	Reduced time in converting to electronic documents;
•	Additional features available for electronic documents;
•	Consistency with changing technology.

Potential suppliers:

USPS desires to contract with a supplier who has significant expertise in the following:

•	Implementation of the move to structured authoring
•	Implementation of the move from unstructured to structured FrameMaker software.
•	Experience in developing electronic documentation.
•	Experience in creating electronic documentation (HTML, XML, etc.) from unstructured and structured FrameMaker software.

The intent of this RFI is to determine who the suppliers for this service are. 
Notification to Respondents:

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their status. 




Minimum Requirements:

The following is a current non-exclusive set of constraints (minimum requirements) that should be met for any responder seeking pre-qualification:

1.	Creation of Structured Environment
The respondent must propose how they will create the structured authoring environment. This shall include the creation of structure definition, creation of templates, creation of conversion files, etc.

2.	Creation of Electronic Conversion Process
The respondent must propose various options to convert maintenance manuals to electronic versions for posting to the MTSC web site. The proposal shall include options for converting legacy FrameMaker documents and structured FrameMaker documents.

3.	Implementation Planning
The respondent must propose a plan that depicts the implementation of both short term and long term goals and objectives. The plan shall outline the most beneficial method of achieving improvements over time. The plan should outline both MTSC and supplier activities to reach objectives and show how and when the activities interact. Plan shall specify all resources required for full implementation (supplier personnel, MTSC personnel, and hardware/software). The plan shall also insure that any system developed will easily interface with future growth and technology.

4.	Training
The respondent must propose a training program that will accomplish moving MTSC to authoring in structured FrameMaker and the creation of electronic manuals. Supplier shall describe training materials, classroom instruction, self-guided learning, and other potential options.

Capabilities:

1.	The respondent must provide a brief overview of the company’s size, structure, number of years in business providing services such as those required by USPS.
2.	The respondent must provide the name of three (3) structured authoring environment document conversion projects which are comparable or larger than USPS including a brief overview of the process performed for each project.
3.	The respondent must discuss their approach to quality assurance.

<DESC>The Centers For Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under Simplified Acquisitions Procedures (Dollar Threshold $100,000) a fixed price government purchase order to Zachary Dyckman of Dyckman & Associates, 1050 17th Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, D.C. 20036 for evaluation of various measures of physician’s productivity and coordination of conference on physician’s productivity.  The contractor has more than 20 years of experience in healthcare policy research and consulting, primarily in the areas of physician payment systems, healthcare cost analysis, litigation support, pharmacy benefits, and managed care program evaluation.  His clients have included federal and state government agencies with healthcare financing and regulatory responsibilities, national and state provider organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more than thirty managed care and health insurance plans.  Previously, he served as Executive Vice President of CHPS Consulting (Center for Health Policy Studies).  He has also held senior level positions on the President’s Council on Wage and Price Stability at the Department of Health Education and Welfare, and at Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.  Dyckman has evaluated and designed physician payment systems for numerous public and private health insurance programs.  He recently completed a project for a consortium of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans to help them design and implement performance-based provider payment systems.  This work included identifying process and outcomes criteria for measuring physician quality and cost-effectiveness that can be incorporated into an incentive payment system and developing effective physician communication and reporting strategies.  He has also helped managed care plans develop global service payment approaches, under which a single payment is made for all professional and facility related services provided during a hospital admission.

His broad based health care research and consulting work had led to numerous litigation support and regulatory analysis assignments.  He has testified at several major health care antitrust trials, at trials involving provider fee dispute and other health care issues, at state regulatory hearings, and before state legislative and Congressional committees.  Over the past several years, he has directed damage estimation efforts involving analysis of large claims data sets for several provider fraud and abuse cases.  He has worked as an expert witness in several managed care class action and healthcare antitrust cases.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neurogenetics Branch (NB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with MDS Pharma Services, 621 Rose Street, Lincoln, NE  68502 for the continuation of an on going study  of a phase I safety and tolerability study of the drug idebenone in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia.  Friedreich’s ataxia is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder affecting 5-10,000 individuals in the United States.  Friedreich’s ataxia is caused by mutations in the gene FRDA, which leads to defects in mitochondrial function.  Currently, there is no treatment for this disorder.  Idebenone is a synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10, a naturally occurring factor that works in mitochondria to facilitate oxidative phosphorylation and protect against the harmful effects of free radicals.  In several small European trials, idebenone has shown promising results as a potential treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia.  This study will be a dose-escalation trial conducted in three separate cohorts: children, adolescents and adults with Friedreich’s ataxia.  The doses of idebenone to be studied range from 2.5 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg, at the high end, this is several fold higher than delivered in humans previously, and an important component of this trial is determining the pharmacokinetic profile of high dose idebenone and its major metabolite QS-10.  MDS Pharma Services developed a validated method for detection of idebenone and QS-10 in human plasma according to Good Laboratory Practice methods accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Under this procurement, MDS Pharma Services will analyze idebenone and QS-10 on samples utilizing methods validated and accepted by the FDA Industry Guidance for Method Development and Validation of methods for the measurement of drugs in biological matrices.  MDS Pharma Services is the only organization with a validated method for idebenone and QS-10 in human plasma. This is a continuation of an on-going phase I clinical trial and it is essential that the study samples be processed by the same laboratory in order not to introduce new variables into this on-going clinical trial. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 24, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541380; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Department of State's National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community.  The School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS) orients new State Department employees and other United States Government (USG) employees to the foreign affairs environment; provides high-quality job-related training for Foreign and Civil Service personnel. The Economic and Commercial Training Division of SPAS trains employees to function effectively in economic jobs abroad and in the Department of State and other USG agencies.  Economic training programs range from 22 short, specialized courses to a nine-month program delivering the equivalent of a strong B.S. degree in economics along with a heavy dose of applied economics.  Specialized courses focus on trade issues and dispute resolution, aviation, telecommunications, energy, terrorist financing, intellectual property rights and biotechnology.  Three tradecraft programs with multiple offerings each prepare officers for a first assignment in economic and political sections; commercial work; and environment, science and technology.  

In the past, FSI has contracted with individuals and organizations in satisfying the continuous need for quality training in a variety of courses in its economic division.   The Division of Economic and Commercial Studies is currently seeking individual contractors for an array of work schedules (both regular and sporadic) for intermittent activities. Successful contractors may join an existing training or program management staff composed of government employees and other contractors. The struggle to anticipate all needs related to a particular topic or theme, the constant need to solicit proposals, and the rigidity of a single contract has led to the identification of a more flexible contracting instrument known as a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  This instrument will be used for this for this current effort.

This current effort will result in multiple awards effective for the entire period specified. This solicitation will result in a pool of external trainers, consultants, and coaches contracted via intermittent, part-time, or full-time multiple award agreements. Agreements established as a result of this solicitation are not for United States Government Civil Service jobs. Performance of these services will occur only as authorized by specific task orders detailing dates, tasks and schedules. There will be no limit to the number of orders issued under any of the prospective ordering agreements. The government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations. There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, tasks, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual orders against resulting BPAs. 

FSI intends to issue orders under the BPAs to deliver specialized training on topics that will be relevant to employees of the Department of State and of other Foreign Affairs agencies, including but not limited financial and trade policy skills.  Orders will be issued under this BPA based upon the government's need and according to FSI's determination of what is most advantageous to the Government. FSI does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA. 

Proposal due date is to be open for the entire potential contract performance period (through August 31, 2010). Proposals will be received, reviewed periodically, and subsequent awards will be made on a continual basis. 

Due to technical issues the “Request for Proposals” document is currently unable to be posted to site. Until these issues have been remedied please forward requests for solicitation document via electronic-mail to Bernard Salter Jr. at salterb@state.gov.  Include company name, point of contact, and fax number.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, engineering and management, materials, equipment, tools, supplies and tra nsportation to perform all work required to complete the work.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. One contract will be negotiated and awarded.

<SUBJECT>99--Long Range Radar Service Life Extension Program
<SOLNBR>4342
<RESPDATE>090605
<CONTACT>Curtis Fields, (202)385-8649
<DESC>Posting: Note revised email address.  In conjunction with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the FAA has a requirement to extend the service life of the ARSR-1, ARSR-2, and AN/FPS series radar systems, herein referred to as the Long Range Radar Service Life Extension Program (LRR SLEP).  The scope of the effort includes the design, test, and implementation of a single configuration diplex mode solid-state transmitter to replace the redundant tube-type transmitter assemblies found in the current (68) ARSR-1, ARSR-2, and AN/FPS LRR systems.  The contractor will be responsible for designing the modification, implementing and testing the design in a first article, sparing, installing Limited Production kits at key sites and supporting operational testing performed by the Government.  The contractor will be required to ensure that the design of the modification maintains the existing antenna and CD-2 functionality as well as incorporates the existing receiver and search processing with modifications as required.  The contractor will be required to ensure that the operational performance of the existing systems is not degraded by this modification, and ensure that there is no growth in environmental control requirements, power consumption, electromagnetic compatibility/interoperability requirements or technical risks relative to the legacy systems being replaced/modified without prior written approval from the Government.  The contractor will be required to provide organic repair capabilities, such as test beds, equipment, tooling, hardware, and software for FAA Logistics Center depot support. Contractors interested in participating in a competitive procurement for the LRR SLEP are requested to submit a capabilities statement not to exceed 10 pages in length.  Contractors should assure that the statement is received by the Contract Specialist not later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,  Sept. 6, 2005.  It is requested that this statement address the following: Â·	Provide a synopsis of any technical expertise or experience with radar Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) and radar solid-state transmitter design, test, implementation and installation. Â·	Provide a synopsis of resources available to implement/provide a SLEP on critical NAS equipment.  This would include both human resources as well as available facilities to store and repair system components. The FAA will not use the capabilities statements to screen or down select.  Rather, they will be used to determine the range of contractor interest, experience, and capability.  The FAA plans to issue a draft Statement of Work for comment to contractors responding to this market survey.  Interested contractors should send their capabilities statements via email to Contract Specialist Curtis Fields at: Curtis.ctr.fields@faa.gov.  They may also be sent via express mail to the following address: Curtis Fields Room 5E41SS Federal Aviation Administration 600 Independence Ave. S.W. Washington, D.C. 20591

<SUBJECT>A--Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques to Measure the Physical Parameters Involved During the Inflation and Descent Phases of Round Parachutes and Ram-air Inflated Parafoils
<SOLNBR>DAAD15-AADD-INSTRMEAS
<RESPDATE>103105
<ARCHDATE>12302005
<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Center (RDECOM-NSC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) for white papers on instrumentation and measurement techniques to measure the physical paramet ers involved during the inflation and descent phases of round parachutes and ram-air inflated parafoils.  The objectives of the measurements are to monitor the aerodynamics and structural dynamics of parachutes (full-scale and small-scale parachutes) and t o provide a database for the verification and validation of the mathematical/computer models currently being developed by NSC to predict the performance of parachutes.  Highly sensitive, fast responding, light weight, and wireless sensors, and minimally or  non-obtrusive measurement techniques are needed to monitor the transient air flow inside and outside the parachute canopy, the structural dynamics of the canopy fabric and the overall parachute shape and motion.  Specifically, the following are the parame ters to be measured: spatial canopy position, motion and geometry, fabric strain, opening force, air velocity, air pressure, and overall flow field.  Multiple sensors are required to fully monitor the large flow field and fabric of the canopy.  Measurement s of the flow field desired include (but are not limited too) canopy surface fluid pressure, pressure field in the near wake of the parachute, velocity field in the near wake and internal flows of the canopy, and boundary layer profiles on the canopy surfa ce.  Given the significant changes in the shape and the short time in which parachutes inflate, transient measurements of all these parameters are necessary and desired.  Although it is desired to conduct full-scale parachute tests in an open atmosphere or  a free-drop environment, it is necessary to conduct some parachute experiments under more controlled conditions, such as wind/water tunnels using small-scale parachutes.  However, it is essential that instrumentation and measurement techniques be utilized  in a larger scale environment, such as parachutes deployed from an aircraft or parachutes free-dropped inside a large, high ceiling, enclosed building (such as a blimp hangar or sports arena) with the instrumentation moving with the parachute or the parac hute moving past the instrumentation at a fixed region.  Small-scale parachutes will also be tested in the free-drop environment.   	Full-size US Army parachute canopy size varies from 962 sq. ft. (35 ft. diameter) for personnel parachutes to 7,850 sq. ft. (100 ft. diameter) for cargo parachutes.  Small-scale parachutes being considered for testing range in size from 0.8 sq. ft. to 200  sq. ft. (1-16 ft. diameter).  Canopy fabrics are typically made of nylon having areal densities of 1.1  2.2 oz/sq. yd., and permeability of 0  140 cu. ft./min. at a 1/2-in. water pressure.  The loading density of the canopy fabric is between 0.5 and 1 l b/sq. ft. for full-size canopies (during steady descent) and 0.1 to 0.5 for small-scale canopies.  Opening times of full-scale parachutes are on the order of seconds and those of small-scale parachutes for wind tunnel studies are less than one second.  The  associated peak opening forces are on the order of 5 to 10 Gs.  Vertical descent velocities are 15 - 30 ft/sec; some one-time use parachutes for humanitarian airdrop missions have higher descent velocities at about 70 ft./sec.  Instrumentation is generall y more developed for small-scale parachutes in wind/water tunnel studies than for full-scale parachutes.  But a capability to monitor the detailed flow field of full-scale parachutes is particularly needed for parachute testing and development. All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a White Paper to NSC in accordance with NSC Broad Agency Announcement 05-07 which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ssbaa.htm.   Proprietary information will not be disclosed outs ide the U.S. Government.  Nothing s hall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI.  Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, an d all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.  Responses shall be submitted by 31 Oct 2005 and may be sent via email to Calvin.Lee@Natick.Army.Mil or by regula r mail to US Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier Center, AMSRD-NSC-AD-AT (ATTN: Dr. Calvin Lee), Kansas Street, Natick, MA, 01760, Telephone (508) 233-4267, Fax (508) 233-5000.

<DESC>This Amendment to Pre-Solicitation Notice FA7000-05-R-0025 is hereby issued to acknowledge that the solicitation will be issued as an RFQ vs. a formal RFP.  Due to internal system errors, an "R-type" solicitation number for RFP vs. a "T-type" solicitation number for RFQ was initiated.  However, this is not accurate and this amendment is issued to correct that misconception.  A letter RFP will not be issued.  Instead, an SF 1449 RFQ FA7000-05-T-0123 will be issued in its place.  All steps and procedures are in compliance and accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 12 and 13.  


The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc.  The requirement is to replace the eleven [11] year old LC/GC/Mass Spectrometer for the Chemistry Department at USAFA CO.  The Department of Chemistry has an important need for an ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System to meet the requirements of large molecule inorganics or organometalics, nonvolatile molecules and protein/peptide analysis in advanced chemistry courses and work being done in the chemistry research center.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry [TOF MS] was developed in the last 1940’s, but until the 1990’s, its popularity was limited.  Recent improvements in TOF technology, including orthogonal acceleration, ion mirrors [reflections], and high-speed electronics, have significantly improved TOF resolution.  This improved resolution, combined with powerful and easy-to-use electrospray [ESI] and matrix-assister laser desorption ionization [MALDI] ion sources, have made TOF MS a core technology for the analysis of both small and large molecules.  Most of the introductory organic or analytical chemistry courses work with volatile organic compounds that can easily be analyzed on Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometers [GCMS.  As chemistry courses advance into courses such as Biochemistry, Macro Biochemistry and Materials Science studies larger and more complex molecules are studied.  To work with these large molecules, a new type of sample introduction process is needed to transfer, separate and inject Liquid Chromatography [LC] into a mass spectrometer [TOF MS].  As well as being an extremely sensitive detection system [TOF MS] can separate large proteins and peptides, like RNA and DNA for example.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide a more “user friendly”, easy to maintain, and highly technological ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System that is capable of meeting the needs of the USAFA Chemistry Department, departmental teaching criteria and student ease of use requirements.  The Agilent Technologies model 1100 series ESI/MALDI/ LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  “See Note 22”.

<DESC>Please note response date has been extended to 25 Aug 2005. The below answers are provided for clarification of RFI.

1)  The RFI for the C-130 paratrooper door plug states that more C-130 documentation relevant to this initiative may be available upon request.  I’m wondering if there are any drawings and/or other technical requirements documents that could help with evaluating our ability to support this requirement?  No, the only RFI that has other data associated with it is the Cargo Door Plug 

 

2) Are any layouts available showing proposed window configuration/locations?  Has a desired size/location been determined?  For both RFIs we were leaving the decision wide open for industry’s ideas, because we would like to get the widest possible selection of solutions. 

 

3) Regarding the Cargo Door Plug, we assume that this is for the aft cargo door/ramp and not the side cargo door which is located FWD LH side on certain model C-130's.  Please confirm.  Yes

 

4) Is there any scanning equipment that is used in conjunction with these windows?  Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  If so, do you have size requirements for this equipment?  Allow for helmet and goggles.

 

Lg. Helmet : 10”H x 11”W x 13”H Deep

                                    W/NVG

 

UP Position 13”H x 11”W x 13” Deep

 

            Down Position 10”H x 11”W x 15” Deep

 

5) Please clarify that the kit will include the modification parts needed for any door surround structure modification.  Yes.

 

6) Please clarify how the window will be used in flight for both the cargo and paratrooper doors.  For visual threat scanning by aircrew members Will the window be removed when the door needs to be retracted and replaced with a plug? Again this is another area that industry has the discretion, the plug is not to impact operational capability and that’s where the restrictions stop.  All ideas are welcome and will be considered and evaluated.

 

7) Will the Cargo Door Plug assembly kit require parts and assemblies to support modifications to the mentioned aircraft systems (heating, O2, Intercom, defensive systems..)? Yes, all other surrounding 

supporting equipment.

 

8) Would it be desirable that the window assembly for the cargo and paratrooper doors be interchangeable? Any design that meets the requirement is welcomed.  However, these are two separate programs that will be evaluated independently.

 

 

9) The RFI QUESTIONS section of the RFI has a list of MILESTONE METRICS. Is there an expectation for the contractors RFI response for this other than answering the question in item 8 under this heading? Yes, as the RFI stated; answer one through seven as the RFI stated and if respondents feels there should be information added then please add it.

 

10) This RFI seems to be asking for a lot of Cost data. Is WR-ALC really looking for, in effect, six different ROM Cost breakouts? No, two general rough estimates of what industry thinks it will cost for each RFI.

 

11) Are these really independent RFI's (PDP and CDP)? Yes, these are independently funded/managed programs.

 

12) Is this really a Request for Proposal (RFP) and not just an RFI?  You are asking for Dollars like an RFP.  We are asking for a dollar figure to help program for this requirement.  This is a high ranking item on AMC leadership’s agenda and they request industry input on order of magnitude for cost budgeting.       

 

13) The RFI indicates that C-130 documents related to the RFI are available on request. What information do you have available?  For the CDP there are older drawings that are available. 

 

14) Do you have a door drawing? Yes.

 

15) In my research of the PDP and CDP RFIs I did not see where a Part Number (P/N) or National Stock Number (NSN) was assigned or applied for.  Maybe, the Material Manager (MM) or Program Manager (PM) could answer these questions.  We can only assume this question is asking if the PDP or CDP have a stock number or part number assigned yet.  Neither the PDP nor the CDP currently exist.  Once one is developed appropriate numbering will be assigned.

 

16) Also, has a date for the Industry Day been determined?  Not at this time.

 

 

17) The format of the response to the RFI, do you have a format requirement and limit on page quantity?  Or a preferred outline. Please limit the number of pages to 15 in any style and format of your choosing. 

18) What is the absolute last day that a response can be submitted?  Response date  is hereby extended to Aug, 25 2005.

19) The government needs milestones 1-7 as a minimum, in addition to any additional items that industry feels needs to be added.

20) The Paratroop Door will have to have the capability to have Armor installed to protect the scanner in addition to the helmet and goggles. The ability to utilize existing C-130 Paratroop Door Armor designs is preferred.

<SUBJECT>59 -- The ALTRO (ALICE TPC Read Out) chip
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-ALTRO
<RESPDATE>082505
<ARCHDATE>09092005
<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates, operator of the Brookhaven National Laboratory under USDOE Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886 is seeking additional sources for the ALTRO (ALICE TPC Read Out) chip.   The only known source is through CERN, in Switzerland.  The ALTRO (ALICE TPC Read Out) chip is a mixed analogue-digital custom integrated circuit dedicated to the digitization and processing of gaseous detector signals. It contains 16 channels operating concurrently on the analogue signals coming from 16 independent inputs. Upon arrival of a first level trigger, each input signal is sampled, processed and stored in a data memory. The maximum number of samples that can be continuously processed for each trigger (data stream) is 1008. When a second level trigger (accept) is received the data stream is either frozen in the data memory, till its complete readout takes place, or discarded. The data memory has the capacity to store 8 data streams.

The analogue to digital conversion, the signal processing is performed in 5 steps: a first correction and subtraction of the signal baseline, the cancellation of long-term components of the signal tail, a second baseline correction, the suppression of the samples so close to the baseline that contain no useful information (zero suppression), and formatting. The data processing and the readout of the data memory are performed at different frequencies.
 
Every single ALTRO channel is comprised of 7 main building blocks described hereafter: The analogue input signal is converted into a digital stream by an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with 10-bit dynamic range and up to 40 MS/s sampling rate.

The first baseline correction corrects the systematic instability of the signal baseline, allowing the subtraction of time-dependant pedestal values taken from the pedestal memory. At this step, the variations of the pedestal in between triggers are also self-corrected. Alternatively the pedestal memory can act as a look-up table, addressed by the input data, that can be used to perform a conversion of the input signal during the pedestal subtraction. Finally the pedestal memory can also be used to generate a test pattern; an important feature that allows a complete test of the overall processing chain without input signal.

The signal of a gas detector is often characterized by a long tail with a rather complex shape. An accurate cancellation of the signal tail is required in order to perform efficiently the zero suppression. The tail cancellation filter is based on the approximation of the tail by the sum of exponential functions. Flexibility for the different 16 channels is also given by the possibility to re-configure channel by channel the digital signal processing by changing programmable coefficients.

After the tail cancellation a second baseline correction corrects the perturbation of the baseline produced by non-systematic effects. Assuming that systematic and tail-dependant perturbations have been removed in the previous two stages, any remaining deviation is due to non-systematic effects. The second baseline correction computes a moving average on certain samples and then subtracts this value from the signal.

The zero suppression is based on a fixed threshold pulse detection scheme, where samples of value smaller than a constant decision level (threshold), are rejected. To reduce the noise sensitivity, a glitch filter checks for a consecutive programmable number of samples above the threshold. In order to keep enough information for further feature extraction, a programmable sequence of pre-samples and post-samples is also recorded. Eventually, the merging of two subsequent sets, closer than 3 samples, is foreseen.

The zero suppressed data is formatted in 40 bit words. Every block of samples is labeled with its time and length to allow posterior reconstruction. At the end of the acquisition period, the data block is labeled with a trailer word. The whole structure, is back-linked, that is, each trailer word points to the end of the previous data block.

Trigger related data is stored in a multiple-event buffer. The Multiple-Event Buffer is a 1024x40 RAM partitioned in a programmable number (4 or 8) of fixed-length buffers. The data is continuously processed, when a trigger is received, a window (Processing Time Window, PTW) defines the stream of data to be formatted and stored in the multi-event memory. The implementation of the processing chain requires 18 pipeline stages. With this pipeline a programmable number of samples before the trigger (pre-trigger samples) can be stored by enlarging the PTW. This feature allows the compensation of the trigger latency to the extent of 15 times the sample clock period.

The ALTRO chip interfaces to the external world through 16 analogue inputs, a 40 bit bidirectional
bus and 8 control signals. The bus protocol is asynchronous for instructions, with a 2-line handshake. The readout, however, is a synchronous block transfer that allows a rate of up to 300 MBytes/s.

Additional information may be found in the attached Specification.

<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates, operator of Brookhaven National Laboratory under USDOE Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886 is seeking additional sources for the ALICE TPC PASA (Pre-Amplifier Shaping Amplifier)Chip. The only known source it through CERN in Switzerland.  The ALICE TPC PASA (Pre-Amplifier Shaping Amplifier)is an Application Specific Integrated Circuit that implements a 16-channel charge sensitive shaping amplifier. This circuit is conceived and optimized to fulfill the requirements set by the readout of the ALICE TimeProjection Chamber (TPC). The ALICE TPC consists of a cylindrical gas volume (about 90 m3 of Ne-CO2), divided in two drift regions by a high voltage plane located at its axial centre, under a uniform electrostatic field. At the endplates, conventional Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers provide the charge amplification and readout by means of a cathode plane segmented in about 5.7x105 pads. In the MWPC the signal released on the pads is characterized by a fast rise time (less than 1 ns) and a long tail. The amplitude has a typical value of 7 „¿A. The signal is delivered on the detector impedance that, to a very good approximation, is a pure capacitance of the order of few pF. The front-end electronics for the ALICE TPC is built on two basic units: the PASA and the ALTRO chips. The latter is a mixed-signal ASIC that integrates 16 channels, each consisting of a 10-bit 25-MSPS ADC, the baseline subtraction, a filter for the cancellation of the signal tail, the zero suppression and a multi-event buffer. The complete readout chain is contained in Front End Cards (FEC), with 128 channels each, connected to the detector by means of capton cables.  Additationl information is provided in that attached specification.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the M70 Series Cable assemblies. If a solicitation is issued, winter calendar year 2005, the government will utilize a Best Value, range bid appro ach, and the resulting contract could be a multiple year requirements contract. Potential bidders should be aware that all gage designs, quality requirements and Government witnessed First Article testing must be satisfactorily completed prior to initial p roduction.  Monthly deliveries would be required as early as July 2006, with estimated yearly quantities of: FY06  35,239, FY07  36,036, FY08  34,812, FY09- 31,975, FY10  47,425. However, FY08 might require incorporation of an entirely new technical da ta package. Such cables are the method used to transfer fuze power from the delivery aircraft to electronic bomb fuzes and target detecting devices to initiate the energetic explosive. Cables are identical except for length. The cable assembly consists of 2 lengths of cordage, with a fuze plug on one end of each and a 1 1\2 inch plastic receptacle that joins the other end of each.  The cable assembly is very difficult to produce to the exacting First Article and Lot Acceptance Test parameters. Any potential  producer must have a highly trained,  experienced workforce whom possesses the critical, specialized skills and processes required to manufacture and test the cable assemblies. The solicitation document/technical data package contains information that has been designated as Militarily Critica l Technical Data. Only businesses certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement, may have the solicitation document/technical data package. All requests for copies of the solicitation  document/technical data package must include a certified  copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017- 3084 or call the DLIS at (800)-352-3572. The DLIS Unites States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/. After receipt of required certification,  interested parties may request a copy of the top drawings via email to hillm@afsc.army.mil. Request must include your cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, certification number and point of contact. A respondent to this sources sou ght survey must have available facilities, equipment, skills and personnel to produce the cable assembly. Only SERIOUSLY INTERESTED U.S./Canadian firms whom feel they are capable of producing the cable assembly are invited to indicate their interest by pro viding the Government a brief description and summary of their companys capabilities, including a brief description of their organization, name/address/point of contact, facilities/equipment, personnel, inspection capabilities, and past manufacturing expe rience as it relates to the above criteria, and minimum and maximum monthly production rates of past production of same or similar items. Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: U.S. Army Field Support C ommand,  ATTN:AMSFS-CCA-M/MARY HILL, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Il 61299-6500, email  hillm@afsc.army.mil, and identify the M70 Series cable assembly sources sought survey as the subject of your response. This sources sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of  the Government.

<SUBJECT>60 -- Fiber Optic State-of-Charge Monitor for Batteries
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has described a fiber-optic sensor that acts as a state-of-charge monitor for batteries which operates independently of the battery and provides a continuous in-situ measurement of the state-of-charge.  The state-of-charge monitor is especially applicable to lead-acid batteries.  A patent for this technology has been approved by the U.S. Patent Office (Patent #6,356,675).  

The state-of-charge monitor for batteries could be utilized in various applications.  For example, measuring battery deterioration will become increasingly important as more hybrid electric/gas vehicles, with their high reliance on batteries, take to the highways.  Another possible use for the device is for cheap, continual monitoring of battery banks maintained by local phone companies as back-up power to keep home phones working when wall-current electricity fails due to an outage.  

Sandia’s primary focus is in seeking companies interested in partnering opportunities for prototype development leading to commercial manufacturing of this technology..  Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

For further information, interested parties should contact Teresa Montoya at Sandia National Laboratories by fax at 505-844-8011 or by email at tmontoy@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of this FBO notice and the type of partnering agreements your company would be most interested in entering into.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Salvia Diagnostics
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is actively soliciting an industry partner to commercialize a portable device being developed at Sandia for applications in oral diagnostics. Sandia’s work to date, funded by NIH, has resulted in an easy-to-use diagnostic device, which is self-contained and handheld, for detection of biomarkers in oral fluids.  Applications for this diagnostic platform include detection of biomarkers of oral (e.g., periodontal disease) and systemic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and conditions.  Previous barriers to implementation of saliva diagnostics included sensitivity, miniaturization, automation and low cost.  Sandia’s work has overcome these barriers.


The industry partner is also expected to actively participate in a funding proposal to NIH involving further development and commercialization of the portable device for oral diagnostics .  The partner will facilitate Sandia’s proposal by providing a product development plan that outlines validation and regulatory strategies through clinical evaluation to be achieved in the award years.   

The Partnership may take the form of a Cooperative Research & Development Agreement (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.  


If your company has the regulatory and clinical trial experience, technical capability and manufacturing capacity to produce these devices for commercial applications, and if you wish to pursue this unique opportunity, please email a brief description of your company, your contact information, and your interests in this venture to: clburch@sandia.gov. You will be contacted by a business representative who will discuss the requirements and steps for working with Sandia.    Please respond no later than Sept 9, 2005

<SUBJECT>B -- Regular measurement programs of greenhouse gas mixing ratios and stable isotopes of carbon dioxide
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), Environment Canada Air Quality Research Branch to carry out regular measurement programs of greenhouse gas mixing ratios and stable isotopes of carbon dioxide.  CMDL and MSC measurements from air samples collected at the Canadian Arctic station at Alert have previously been carefully compared by the two laboratories, providing a foundation for further collaborative measurements.  Collaborative measurements must be carried out in order for CMDL to meet the North American goals of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.  CMDL requires the regular, long-term measurements discussed above, within a network of carefully chosen sites in North America, to study the variation of greenhouse gases with height, which will enable CMDL and other scientists to quantify the predicted North American terrestrial biosphere’s net uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Quantifying the North American carbon budget and identifying implications for the global carbon cycle are priority items outlined in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan.  Period of performance shall be September 1, 2005 to September 30, 2006.  MSC operates the BERMS site in Canada where CMDL requires these measurements to be carried out.  This site is a secure facility with limited access.  In addition, MSC already has personnel in place with the required expertise in the air sampling and analysis that is required.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and shall address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Award date will be August 30, 2005.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 working days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION 

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Altium, Inc. of San Diego, CA under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this simplified acquisition is to provide FBI engineers with software that is compatible with previous versions of Protel and will allow previously prepared and qualified component libraries to be integrated into new designs.  Introduction of a new software tool would require FBI engineers to expend additional funding for training and travel which is considered to be counter-productive since they are already familiar or are trained on other versions of the Protel software.  This would place unnecessary burdens on an already taxed FBI budget, not to mention the crtical time off required for training that would make engineers unavailable for any unforseen emergency situations that may arise as a result of FBI field requirements.  This award will be made utilizing simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Part 13.  Interested concerns having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement may submit a capability statement in a written format detailing the concern’s ability to meet the objectives of this requirement.  Capability statements must reference RFP-0155024 and must be sent via fax to (703) 339-2760.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available; therefore, requests for such a document will be considered invalid responses.   A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice, the Contracting Officer will pursue a sole source contract with Altium, Inc.

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among and society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.    In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, which expanded the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration. The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty to applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’s technical assistance FY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to deliver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards.  The successful contractor shall have the capability of performing technical assistance to  grassroots faith based and community  organizations, that provide services to risk populations in underserved areas in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among and society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.    In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, which expanded the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration. The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty to applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’s technical assistance FY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to deliver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards.  The successful contractor shall have the capability of performing technical assistance to  grassroots faith based and community  organizations, that provide services to risk populations in underserved areas in North Carolina and South Carolina.  The goals are to enhance treatment potential within the community, increase the potential for treatment and prevention education among clergy and community leaders, identify sources of funds and materials to enhance network ability, collaboration, planning and evaluating community efforts and services.
