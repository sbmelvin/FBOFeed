<SOLNBR>140G0219R0019
<RESPDATE>051319
<ARCHDATE>09302019
<CONTACT>Valdez, Robert
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541360 with a Small Business Size Standard $15.0M for an upcoming requirement for conducting an airborne magnetic total-field radiometric survey in Northwestern Arkansas to provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 

Project Description: The USGS requests airborne radiometric and total-field magnetic data covering parts of northwestern Arkansas as part of the USGS National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. The geophysical data will allow assessment of several key science themes including: (1) investigations of the varying depth and nature of crystalline basement as well as cross-cutting structures, (2) assessment of rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphorite deposits; (3) whether basement structures were reactivated and influenced Paleozoic sedimentation, and (4) how structures may have influenced both ancient and modern fluid pathways with associated controls on past mineralizing Mississippi Valley Type fluids and modern ground waters. The geophysical survey will assess potential near-surface magnetic and gamma ray sources from sedimentary units that may inform unit shapes, fault truncations, and shallow radiogenic mineral distributions that will aid ongoing geologic mapping by the USGS and the Arkansas Geological Survey. 

A magnetic system is required that can image the concealed Precambrian igneous rocks and associated structures. Additionally, the magnetic data may be used to map magnetite-bearing sedimentary rocks within the shallow crust. The magnetic data are intended for rigorous interpretation of  the 3-D geometry and lithology of rocks. It is expected that the most subtle anomalies present will be critical to the ultimate interpretation, so very high resolution and low noise data are critical. The radiometric data will be used to map radioelement changes related to surface geologic units. The traverse line spacing shall be 200 m. The tie line spacing shall be 3000m. The nominal terrain clearance shall be 80-100 meters, although it is understood that greater terrain clearances may be required in several places. 

The Contractor shall furnish all travel, mobilization, labor, materials, aircraft and aircraft facilities, and demobilization, except as otherwise specified herein, required for conducting a magnetic survey. The contractor shall provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications set forth in this contract.

The government has a definite requirement for and plans to award a minimum of 13,000 line kilometers (km) with an up to 87,000 optional “add-on” line km pending availability of funds.    

A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. 

Responses to this announcement are requested from (1) SBA certified Small Business HubZone firms; (2) Small Business firms certified by a Small Business Administration (SBA) district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; (3) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small Business firms; (4) Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 541360 if their AVERAGE annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to $15.0 million. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms shall submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER); (2) a CAPABILITY STATEMENT including (a) RECENT (within the last three fiscal years) RELEVANT (similar projects to this requirement) performance history (identify the name of the owner and their point(s) of contact with telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses; and (b) in what capacity (e.g., prime, subcontractor etc.) they performed the work; and (3) their SIZE STATUS. 

Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM). You will also be required to provide your small business status information either via the RFP or the On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) also located at the SAM website before an award to your company can be made. Your on-line ORCA registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government, and only needs updated annually.

All responses must be submitted NLT May 13, 2019 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: rvaldez@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website and no paper copies will be provided.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, quotes the lowest price, whose quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, and whose quoted price is found to be fair and reasonable.

Offerors who fail to meet any general or special standard of responsibility will not be eligible to receive contract award.

If the quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, the quoted price will be evaluated to determine if it is reasonable.  If the quoted price is found to be reasonable, the offeror who submitted this quote will be identified as the  successful offeror.   The contracting officer will then determine if the successful offeror is responsible using the general standards of responsibility and the special standards of responsibility applicable to this procurement.  If contract award cannot be made to the successful offeror, the contracting officer will evaluate the next lowest-priced quote following the procedures described above.  This process will continue until a contract award can be made, or the contracting officer determines that no contract award can be made.  The contracting officer may find all quotes not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the lowest-priced quote exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The contracting officer may likewise find a quote under evaluation, as well as all remaining quotes, not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the quote currently under evaluation exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions at any time if determined by the contracting officer to be in the Government s interest.
(c) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or if the quoted price for the basic requirement or any option exceeds the amount of funding available for any of those requirements.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition with following addendum: 
The following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated in full text:
52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.
For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:
The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but not for more than a total of six months during the life of the contract.  The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise.  This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8. The `specified' rates under this clause will be those rates in effect under the contract each time an option is exercised under this clause.

(End of Clause)
52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)
  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years.
(End of Clause)
52.228-5 INSURANCE WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION (JAN 1997)
  (a) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance of this contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.
  (b) Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective 
    (1) For such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed prescribe; or
    (2) Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.
  (c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.

  (a)  Workers' compensation and employer s liability:  Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes.  If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage.  Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.
  (b)  General Liability: $500,000.00 per occurrences.
  (c)  Automobile liability: $200,000.00 per person; $500,000.00 per occurrence and $20,000.00 property damage.
 (End of Clause)
52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR  (APR 1984)
Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30 of ANY fiscal year.  The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30 of ANY fiscal year, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>Colville Trail Construction and Trail Maintenance. <br /><br /><br />The Colville National Forest has a requirement for trail construction and maintenance services throughout the Colville National Forest. Location of the work will be in Stevens, Ferry and Pend Oreille Counties, Washington (located in the NE portion of Washington State).
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all management, labor, equipment, supervision, tools, materials, transportation, operating supplies, workman's compensation, unemployment insurance and incidentals necessary to perform the work in accordance with the specification and provisions of the contract and individual task orders.</p>
<p>The Construction work consists of, but is not limited to, reconstruction of existing trails, new construction for minor existing trail reroutes, improvement, replacement, or construction of trail bridges, puncheons and turnpikes, installation of drainage features such as or waterbars and culverts, and installation of trail signs and/or trail interpretive signs.</p>
<p>The Service work consists of, but is not limited to, logout and clearing of trail, tread maintenance, drainage structure improvements and/or maintenance, and maintenance of trail signs.</p>
<p>A copy of the site location for the first task order (along with the map) is listed in the prospectus/ pre-solicitation notice attached.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and will be for period of approximately five years. The contract will be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>Work will be divided into two items: construction services applicable to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) and maintenance services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards Act. The Government is anticipating making three awards and there is a possibility up to six awards many be made.</p>
<p>The minimum guarantee will be listed in the solicitation along with the ceiling price.</p>
<p>Work will be assigned by the placement of Task Orders issued against the basic contract. The physical work and location will be identified in individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>Task orders will be placed based on Forest priorities, site conditions and funding availability.</p>
<p>The task orders are estimated between $2,000 and $500,000. For any construction task order over $35,000 the contractor must provide a payment bond. For construction task orders over $250,000, contractors must provide both payment and performance bonds.</p>
<p>The Logout and Tread Cleaning annual services are generally required to be done within two weeks of snow melt for most trails. The most intensive period of service annual maintenance task orders work occurs in late June and early July, when over half of the trails open almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>The field work on the other task orders is estimated from May 1th through November 1st depending on weather and site locations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall utilize products and materials that promote energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, use of recovered materials, that are environmentally preferable, and made from bio- based materials including but not limited to: 2-Cycle Engine Oils: Chain and Cable Lubricants; Diesel Fuel Additives; Engine Crankcase Oil; Fuel Conditioners; Gasoline Fuel Additives; Gear Lubricants; Greases; Hydraulic Fluids; etc.) to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of detracting from the overall quality delivered. Visit www.biopreferred.gov for additional information on BioPreferred Products.</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a written request for proposals.</p>
<p>Estimated issue date of the solicitation is on or about the first week in&nbsp;May 2019. The solicitation will be posted electronically at this (FedBizOpps) site when it issues. No hard copies of the solicitation or amendments will be mailed. The actual proposal due date will be listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Awards will be made to the offerors who offers the best value to the Government. Award is estimated to be in the Spring of 2019.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. NAICS code is 237990, size standard is $36.5 million and is applicable to the construction task orders. For the service task orders, the NAICS code is 115310 and the size stand is $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be posted at the site on the issue date.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>A special notice was issued on November 5, 2018 (reference Notice 1205G119R0004SN). The reason for the notice to be issued then was to allow for potential offerors to visit the units last fall to ascertain the extent of work involved and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the prices to the extent the information is obtainable and while the sites are still accessible. Some changes from the notice may occur from the actual solicitation, but the enclosed information is a representative of work to be done.</p>
<p>Information about the site of the first task order is attached with this notice.</p>
<p>In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after the contract has been awarded. No guided tours will be held. For information about the site location, please call Lucy Reeves at 509.684.7244.</p>
<p>The Government assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representation concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of a contract, unless such understanding or representation the Government is expressly stated in a subsequent solicitation and contract.</p>
<p>All inquiries concerning this potential project must be directed to me a 509.684.7114 or fax 509.684.7280. You may also e-mail me at cvanalyne@fs.fed.us.</p>
