<DESC>A. Description of the Proposed Contract Action
<p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award multiple Commercial Item awards for approximately 75 financial audits and examinations, to be conducted according to USAID Automated Directive System (ADS) 591 and Office of Inspector General's (OIG) "Guidelines for Financial Audits Contracted by Foreign Recipients", dated February 2009. These Purchase Orders will be competed according to FAR Part 13 procedures; and as the funding expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2010, awards will be issued on/before September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>USAID's Regional Inspector General in Cairo requires annual audits of every USAID/West Bank and Gaza award, to ensure that USAID/West Bank and Gaza's program have appropriately funded costs that are reasonable, allocable, and allowable. The number of FY 2010 nonfederal audits required has increased from an annual audit requirement of about 48 to 75 audits this year, with greater numbers expected in 2011.</p>
<p>B. Specific Audit Requirements</p>
<p>The audits will be conducted according to 4 different Statements of Work: (1) Fund Accountability Statement (used for Cooperative Agreements and Grants); (2) Cost Representation Statement (used for contracts other than Fixed Price Contracts); (3) Examination Engagement (used for Fixed Price Contracts); and (4) Audit for Cash Transfer Agreements. The audits are generally defined in ADS 591 and OIG's "Guidelines for Financial Audits Contracted by Foreign Recipients." Each audit requires, on average, 27 person-days level of effort.</p>
<p>The audits must reflect a sufficient understanding of the contractor's/recipient's internal controls related to the award, assess control risk, and identify reportable conditions, including material internal control weaknesses. The auditor must perform tests to determine whether the contractor/recipient complied, in all material respects, with award terms and applicable laws and regulations related to USAID-funded programs that have a direct and material affect on contractor's/recipient's Funds and Costs statements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the audits must be conducted by independent public accounting firms approved by the OIG, as per ADS 590 and the OIG's "Guidelines for Financial Audits Contracted by Foreign Recipients." Since application for approval by OIG is open year-round, and given the urgency of this requirement, we will only consider firms which are OIG-approved or will be OIG-approved by the response date listed on this synopsis. In addition, OIG-approved firms must meet the rules in 22 CFR 228, Source, Origin and Nationality for Commodities and Services Financed by USAID; and be able to conduct business in West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>C. Justification for FAR 13 Competitive Procedures</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is to alert potential sources that USAID intends to conduct a procurement using the competitive source selection procedures consistent with FAR 13. FAR 13.105(a) requires the public display and synopsis requirement of FAR 5.101. In following the FAR 13 procedures, USAID does not intend to use a combined synopsis and solicitation. Rather, we intend to solicit according to FAR 13.104, which states that maximum practicable competition ordinarily can be obtained by soliciting quotations or offers from at least three sources within the local trade area.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.
