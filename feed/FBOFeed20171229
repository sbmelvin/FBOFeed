<DESC>MOFFETT BUILDING 19 TENANT IMPROVEMENTS

Construction - tenant improvements on the second floor and in the basement of Bldg 19 at NASA Ames Research Park (Moffett Field) in Mountain View, CA
The U.S. Geological Survey is beginning the process of moving the majority of its personnel resources from their current location in Menlo Park, CA to NASA Ames Research Park (Moffett Field) in Mountain View, CA.  The scope of this project is to complete tenant improvements on the second floor and in the basement of Bldg 19 at Moffett Field in the spring/summer of 2018.  The areas to be renovated are 41,908 net square feet on the second floor, consisting of mixed private and open offices, conference rooms, and supporting spaces for office use; and 3,403 net square feet in the basement for storage.  These areas are currently undergoing selective demolition and hazardous materials abatement under a separate effort, and so will be ready for buildout at the outset of this effort.  CTA Architects Engineers is the designer of record, and TSI Engineering is the demolition/hazardous materials abatement contractor. 
All relevant project documents will be made available electronically to interested parties at no charge with the Invitation for Bids (IFB).  Tentatively, we expect the IFB to be available in late January or early February 2018 and to be open for approximately forty-five (45) days.  A site visit opportunity will be provided during the open period, and prospective contractors are urged and expected to inspect the site where work will be performed.  The period of performance is expected to be approximately 180 days from issuance of the notice to proceed.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  The Construction Wage Requirements Statute (prevailing wage, formerly Davis-Bacon Act) will apply.  A bid bond will be required with all bids.  The successful contractor will be required to obtain performance and payment bonds before being given the notice to proceed.  
We intend to award a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 14 (sealed bidding) and 36 (construction and architect-engineer contracts.)
The applicable product/service code is Z2AA, "repair or alteration of office buildings."  The applicable NAICS code is 236220, "commercial and institutional building construction," size standard $36.5M.  This acquisition is reserved exclusively for participation by small business concerns.
Prospective contractors must hold an appropriate contractor's license in the State of California at the time bids are due to be considered for this project; this is a definitive responsibility criterion.  All State of California regulations regarding contractor's licensing, including the use of appropriately licensed subcontractors, shall be followed on this project.   Prospective contractors who are not licensed will be considered not responsible.  Prospective contractors must submit evidence of current licensure (including evidence of the licensure of named subcontractors) with their bids or the bid will be considered not responsive.
Prospective contractors do not need to respond to this presolicitation notice.  Questions or concerns should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, 916-278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.
Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
(a) Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.
(b  Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
(c) To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.

(d) Password protecting your SF-330 is NOT permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 
Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.
The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated cost of construction for (not design) this project is $5,000,000.00 - $10,000,000.00.  
(a) Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov  Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee.

The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 
(b) The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for JANUARY is JANUARY 1, 2018 to JANUARY 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <br /><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /></strong><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong> <br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a novel system that uses an ultra-violet (UV) camera to detect, inspect, and analyze a corona discharge. This discharge signifies a power line insulation fault, making the technology ideal for use in power line insulation inspections. When coupled to a drone, the technology offers the ability to remotely monitor power lines in a cost effective way. Adding UV camera technology to drones equipped with GPS results in precise, economical surveys. The UV detection is preferable to infrared (IR) systems which are prone to greater interference from the nearby thermal environment. UV detection offers images that isolate the location of the corona discharge with far greater precision than IR images can. Libraries of typical UV images of corona discharges by component type (i.e. insulator vs. conductor) can be added to the firmware to provide additional inspection capabilities. While developed for power transmission line inspection and fault detection, it could be adapted for electric rail and trolley applications or wildfire detection and location. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information. Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company. Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register. <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.</strong> <br />

<DESC>The Government of Nepal ("Government" or "GoN") has applied for grant funding from the Millennium Challenge Corporation ("MCC"), called a Compact, and intends to apply parts of the proceeds of the funds to payments for contracts for goods, works and services. MCC is a U.S. government agency focused on assisting countries dedicated to good governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Compact, related agreements, and the availability of funds, the Government intends to use a portion of the funds to finance professional consulting services to assist the GoN with the implementation of the Compact program in a transparent and sound manner.
<p>The proposed Compact tentatively includes investment from MCC of approximately US$500 million and an additional US$130 million from the Government, for a total of approximately US$630 million. It includes two projects: (i) construction of about 300 kilometers of 400kV electricity transmission lines, three substations, and technical assistance for the power sector; and (ii) technical assistance to improve the road maintenance regime and road maintenance works on about 300 kilometers of the strategic road network. The program would include the procurement of contractors and consultants for design, construction and supervision of electricity lines and substations, road maintenance works, including a variety of technical services, equipment and construction works in different geographic locations within Nepal. These contracts will be competed through open international procurement procedures.</p>

The selection process, as described, will include a review and verification of qualifications and past performance, including a reference check, prior to the contract award.</p>
<p>Submission Procedure: Please submit your Qualifications/CVs using the two (2) forms provided for this purpose in this RCQ. Form QUAL-1 must be submitted signed. Failure to submit a signed copy of Form QUAL-1 may lead to the rejection of the submission.</p>

<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vaisala, Inc. of Louisville, Colorado for assisting the Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR) Global Monitoring Division (GMD) in providing three (3) Vaisala CL51 Ceilometers to be installed at three (3) SURFRAD Network sites, with a government option of purchasing four (4) additional units to outfit all seven SURFRAD sites.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Atmospheric Research's (OAR) requirement for three (3) Vaisala CL51 Ceilometers to be installed at three (3) SURFRAD Network sites, with a government option of purchasing four (4) additional units to outfit all seven SURFRAD sites.  The Vaisala CL51Ceilometer is essential to the timeline and research goals necessitating its purchase.  There are other Ceilometers on the market, but only the CL51 meets programmatic requirements.  NOAA colleagues and non-NOAA affiliates alike operate Vaisala ceilometers, so any other brand of ceilometer would harm scientific collaboration and provide skewed research results.  Vaisala does not authorize resellers to distribute the CL51 Ceilometer.  Direct purchasing from the company is the only available option.  The period of performance is from the date of award through February 15, 2018.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

The contract was awarded as 100% set-aside for small business. The current period performance covering Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake Georgia ends March 31, 2017. This extension will allow the Government to extend the current period of performance to allow for the receipt of proposals, source selection review, discussions, and any potential protest that might be associated with the replacement contract soon to be solicited under W91278-18-R-0014. The revised period of performance may be extended through May 2017.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The contractor shall provide Saline and Gel breast implants and that are filled with a silicone gel or saline that holds together uniformly and retains a natural shape and texture that will resemble breast tissue. The implants must have a set-fill volume for predictable results. The breast implants are pre-filled to an appropriate volume that is required by the surgeon. Offerors shall provide a full complement of volume amounts ranging from 80cc to 800cc. Saline or Gel shall not be added or removed from the implant. Tissue expanders, used in breast reconstruction shall be designed to allow for differential expansion of the breast pocket (greater expansion in the lower portion of the breast). The expander should have an integral "injection port" that allows for simplified and more convenient expansion. Offerors shall provide at a minimum a 30mm port. However, a larger port entry point is optimal due to the potential patient risk should an expander puncture occur.</p>
<p>The technical requirements shall include the styles described within the Price Schedule (See Section III, Price Schedule). Offerors shall provide their gel implant, saline implant and expander listing specifications for verification of the models, styles, profiles, catalog number, volume, width and projections along with their proposals.</p>

<p><strong>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</strong><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical<br />Past Performance<br />Price</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are greater in importance than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />BASIS OF AWARD:</strong> Award will be made on a firm fixed price basis and will be based on a scoring system recognizing all the factors as shown above. The Government intends to make an award based on initial offers, without discussions. As such, Contractors are encouraged to submit their best proposal as their initial offer. While the Government intends to award based on initial offers, the Government reserves the right to open discussions with all Contractors within the competitive range should the Contracting Officer make a determination that discussion would be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The contract will be awarded to the offeror that presents the best value to the government. Technical and past performance when combined are greater in importance than price.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Initially, all technical proposals submitted by offerors will be evaluated. The past performance information provided will be validated by contacting the offeror's submitted information. The price proposal will be evaluated to determine a fair and reasonable price. An award shall be made to the offeror who's proposal represents the best overall value to the Government.</p>

<p><strong>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS:</strong><br />A. Requirements: Proposal specification information necessary for providing the required supplies as stated in the Statement of Work under Paragraph Requirements.</p>
<p>B. Ordering Procedures: Proposal information necessary to provide the ordering procedures as stated in the Statement of Work under Paragraph Ordering Procedures.</p>
<p>C. Warranty: Warranty information on all products.</p>
<p>D. Delivery Days: Number of days.</p>
<p><strong>PAST PERFORMANCE EVLAUATION FACTORS:</strong></p>
<p>The Government will first evaluate the offeror's Past Performance references to determine whether the company has provided relevant Past Performance. A determination of relevant or not relevant will be made for each reference. A relevancy determination may be made based solely on the information provided on the past performance.</p>
<p>Past performance information may be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, such as Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and interviews with Contracting Officer's Representatives/Technical Liaisons.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to utilize other information not provided by the vendor and will evaluate information readily available. It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure names and phone numbers of points of contact are verified and accurate. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). The offeror will receive a neutral rating.</p>
<p>Past Performance reference format: <br /><br />Company Name:___________________________________<br />Address:_________________________________________<br />Contact Name:_____________________________________<br />Contact Telephone No:_______________________________<br />Contact Fax No:_____________________________________<br />E-mail Address:_____________________________________<br />Contract Number (if applicable):________________________<br />Supplies Provided:___________________________________<br />Service Period:______________________________________<br />Information Comments:_______________________________</p>
<p><strong>PRICE:</strong></p>

General Background Information

It is the policy of the VA through VA Directive 6371 that all paper records under the jurisdiction of the VA will be handled by the most secure, economical and effective means in accordance with legal requirements.  PII is the most sensitive form of information handled at the VA and, therefore, requires the use of extraordinary procedures for its protection.  PII that is not properly disposed of can result in actual or potential identity theft and cause personal hardship to the subject individuals.  It is imperative that the appropriate means of destruction be used for all VA temporary paper records.

With the implementation of new and enhanced regulatory criteria and the need for a systematic secured and trackable process, a comprehensive solution is sought by VA Maine Healthcare System to ensure compliance with all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations and VA Directive 6371.  This process shall include but not be limited to being HIPAA compliant and defined and trackable from each point in the process.




Scope 

Contractor will be required to provide a complete written process flow and identify the specific methods and processes used to insure compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and HIPAA, JACHO and all privacy standards and regulations including but not limited to:

VA Directive 6500, Information Security Program
36 C.F.R. 1228.58 Destruction of Temporary Records

Contractor will be required to provide a written policy regarding how they will ensure that their personnel will be scrutinized in the hiring, training, monitoring of compliance to ensure minimal risk due to human error.

Contractor shall provide a written pick-up schedule to the Contracting Officer s Point of Contact (POC) which will be followed to ensure adequate coverage for all locations.  All CBOC s require a monthly pickup (at least) per section II of this PWS.

Contractor will be required to provide lockable containers at each CBOC and at the pickup locations on the main VAMHS campus.  Containers must be in compliance with JACHO and HIPAA standards at the point of collection, as well as the centralized collection location, at each site.  Collection containers distributed throughout the VAMHS facilities must be secured in a manner that prohibits unauthorized individuals from accessing paper records identified for destruction that have been deposited into them.  These containers must provide reasonable physical safeguards which may include, among other measures, locks or placement in secure areas.  

Contractor personnel will pick up materials from the secure point-of-collection containers.

Contractor will be required to provide shredding services on-site so that no confidential materials are removed from the premises before shredding is completed.  

Contractor will be required to provide documentation of the pick   up at each collection point and the total weight of all materials shredded in a monthly report.

Contractor shall be bonded, insured, NAID certified for paper/printed media destruction and can provide reasonable physical safeguards for the data throughout the destruction process.  

Contractor must enter into a fully actuated Business Associate Agreement (BAA) as attached.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is announcing to business and academia its intent to solicit research and development proposals under this Open Broad Agency Announcement (OBAA). This OBAA is contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. This announcement does not request any proposals at this time. Requests for Proposals (or Calls) will be accomplished via amendments to this BAA.
<p>The over-arching strategy of this OBAA involves the use of this 4-year Open BAA (OBAA) to quickly and efficiently execute research and development to deliver practical solutions to urgent chemical and biological defense priorities. This strategy will provide DHS an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to perform rapid prototyping of technical solutions to meet present and compelling chemical and biological defense needs, as ever-changing urgent operational issues and capability gaps are identified.</p>
<p>The OBAA will remain "open" for&nbsp;4 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during Calls. Each Call will identify topics and contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission. Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Calls for proposals (made by amendments to this BAA) will occur periodically throughout the life of this over-arching BAA. Each call will: (1) identify specific topic areas; (2) identify any changes to the standard evaluation criteria or proposal preparation instructions, and; (3) contain common cutoff dates for proposal submissions.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that calls issued under this OBAA will be unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all of the calls. The NAICS code, unless otherwise stated in the OBAA amendments, shall be 541715 (i.e., Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences except Biotechnology), and the size standard is 500 employees. Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this OBAA and its appropriate amendment(s).</p>
<p>Interested offerors should be on alert for any OBAA amendments that call for proposals, permit extensions to the proposal submission dates, or otherwise change the requirements of this OBAA or its subsequent amendments.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice.

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(ii) Examples.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></span></p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be

registered in that NAICS prior to receipt of quote in order to receive an
award. Offeror are reminded that failure to comply shall render their quote
as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:

available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

Subsequently, the contracting activity posted a special notice of intent to Sole-Source on 28 Nov 2017.

<p>The agency does not intend to issue a solicitation package. However, all interested parties should self-identify and provide proof of their firm's capability to provide the prescribed equipment/product(s) by submitting an accurate description of the equipment/product(s) and process to produce the equipment/product(s) described below. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by AEDC.<br /><br />Interested parties are hereby informed that no award will be made on the basis of responses received.

The final decision was made to change the authority from 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency because it was decided that it was too late in the acquisition cycle to solicit from any other sources and a delay in award of a contract to other than the incumbent contractor would cause serious harm to the Government.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
<p>Solicitation No. W912EF18R0004 will be posted to the FBO website on or about mid to late December 2017. Solicitation is advertised as Unrestricted. The solicitation is a Request for Proposal. The proposal due date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.</p>
<p>The construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. NAICS code for this project is 238210.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Work</strong></p>
<p>Manually-operated line disconnect switches and their respective ground switches will be replaced with new motor-operated disconnect switches and new motor-operated ground switches of the same ratings. A new 125VDC circuit will be extended to each new pair of disconnect/ground switch motor operators from the main unit auxiliary panels in the generator bays. Remote control of these line disconnect switches and grounding switches will be provided in the Control Room in a new control panel.</p>
<p>Three sets of bus potential transformers (PT's) for the BPA lines will be replaced with new PT's of the same class and ratings, including replacing their existing wiring to the SCR boards in the Control Room.</p>
<p>Three sets of surge arresters for the BPA lines are to be provided and connected to the 115kV bus sections, including Contractor-designed support structures for mounting the arresters on the Transformer Deck.</p>
<p>Modifications must be provided to one of the 115kV bus sections involving cutting out segments of the 3" tubular aluminum bus and fitting them with straight tube-to-tube connectors for reinstallation after sectionalizing switch has been replaced. This is to provide a present and future means to isolate a switch for replacement and maintenance while leaving Line 1 and station service energized.</p>
<p>All new switch motor-operators are to be operable from the switch operator as well as remotely operable from a new remote control panel to be provided in the Control Room SO5 board, including indication of switch position. Ground switches and line switches will be mechanically interlocked at the switch operators and at the remote control panel to prevent accidental grounding of an energized line.</p>
<p>All new power and control circuits for the new switch operators will be run in a new 9" cable trough to be provided in the Cable Gallery, running from Unit 6 to the Cable Spread Room.</p>
<p><strong>General Contract Requirements</strong></p>
