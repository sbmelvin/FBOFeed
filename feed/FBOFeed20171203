<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:  Non-Flammable Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Batteries</p>
<p>Patent Pending.</p>
<p>The safety of lithium-ion batteries has been a great concern because they contain highly flammable organic electrolytes that can cause fires or even battery explosions under conditions of overcharging, overheating, internal short-circuit, and/or mechanical damage. Superconcentrated electrolytes, including fire-retarded solvents, have also suffered from safety risks, high viscosity, high costs, and other traits that hinder their practical applications.</p>
<p>This invention provides low-flammability and nonflammable electrolytes for stable operation of electrochemical devices such as lithium metal batteries. The electrolytes include an active salt and a solvent made of a flame-retardant compound. The electrolytes are stable in electrochemical cells with alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or carbon-based (e.g., graphite) anodes and various cathode materials. In tests, electrochemical devices using the electrolytes have performed as well as or better than other electrolytes that do not include the flame-retardant compound.</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 31111.</p>
<p>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 31111.</p>
