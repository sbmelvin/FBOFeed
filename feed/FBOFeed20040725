<DESC>Statement of Objective for Iraqi Corrections Service Inmate Management System, Project and Contracting Office Activity

1.0	SUBJECT

The goal of this project is to seek contractors whom are familiar with correctional facilities software system.  Contractors shall procure, install, evaluate and validate the Inmate Management System in Arabic/English that will effectively maintain accountability of all inmates that are currently confined within the Iraqi Corrections Service Institutions. 

2.0	 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The Iraqi Corrections Service (ICS) has never developed or utilized any formal Inmate Management System.  Properly documenting the information surrounding intake of inmates and the discharging of inmates was conducted in a haphazard, non-standard method.  As such, the Iraqi Correction personnel had no specific way of documenting personal information, security information, inmate unit of assignment and other pertinent information surrounding the safety and security of all ICS institutions and the Iraqi Community. 

3.0	  OBJECTVE 

The US Department of Defense (DOD), via the Project and Contracting Office  Activity(PCO) and the Ministry Of Justice (MOJ)(hereinafter referred to as “MOJ”) seek a contractor to procure, implement, evaluate and validate and Iraqi Inmate Management System that Numerically and systematically identifies a person (s) that have been mandated to the Iraqi Corrections Service.  Once in place, the ability to successfully identify confined individuals by name, number or entered profile will be enhance with the increase of efficiency and reduction in cost associated with daily prisons operations. 

4.0  TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND METRICS

4.1 The Contractor must have pre-existing background in Correctional Inmate Management System to procure a program for the ICS.  Background work in Mid-eastern culture a plus.  The contractor must include in his bid the following:

•	Identify/procure inmate identification criteria based off Iraq’s culture.  This must be reviewed by specialist with a refined knowledge of Iraqi’s culture.
•	Define an inmate characteristic profile of each inmate upon intake into the ICS.  
•	All aspects of the training are to be translated into the Arabic language.(translated text of the program is to be reviewed by outside unbiased party (ies) to ensure correctness of information that has been placed within the system and to address any cultural differences/difficulties.  Additionally, the characteristics will also have the ability to be translated into English.
•	Validate the inmate intake procedure by evaluating a selected group of inmates at the time of the inmate incarceration assigned by the courts to their ICS unit of assignment.
•	The contractor will develop the Inmate Management System  (IMS) computer software that is intended to assist in the organization, security, visitation recording and accounting of an inmate number/profile for an Iraqi prison institution.
•	The IMS/software is required to be in Arabic/English.

5.0  Expected Results

5.1 The goal of the software is to have the ability to track specific inmate profile(s), activity and security information to, but not limit to the following:
•	Inmate booking information; inmate release information; inmate gang affiliation (past or present); inmate medical information (i.e., medical conditions, medication and suicide concerns, etc.); inmate classification information; inmate criminal history information; inmate personal information (i.e., name, number, etc.); inmate work assignment information; inmate housing information.
•	Count roster capability; basic case management capability; incident tracking capability; ability to print out daily reports of intakes and releases; Photo identity with fingerprinting capability (ability to print images out); property tracking capability; inmate tracking of events that occur within the facility.
•	Tracking of weapons and equipment issued to ICS employees; tracking of weapons used in incident or offenses; all reports, photo and images prints to any window-supported printer; computer aided dispatch (or computer wizard) module interface with the incident/offense module to automatically generate a starting incident record; ability to track scheduled court events and their dispositions; visitation control-ability to track inmate visitors received by every inmate, indicating the identity of the visitor and actual number of visits and the date and time of their entry and exit.
•	Once developed and validation is accomplished and any changes made, train the ICS to utilize the process; train specific ICS employees (approximately 15 to administer the inmate screening process and develop a syllabus to enable these same ICS employees to act as a cadre of instructors to train required ICS employees throughout ICS; to conduct training for this one time class at the Baghdad ICS headquarter location; 
•	The Government prefers the contractor to supervise the initial function testing, to include test with sample data, and then test cases with real data, and then tests using converted data in a controlled environment.  The initial functionality testing would provide on-site resource for the initial system start-up, including debugging, help-response to users, one-on-one training with critical users, and other recommended approaches to insure smooth implementation.
•	After initial installation and validation, with consideration to the physical location of the application, it will be necessary that the vendor provide a toll free number that personnel from ICS can call to the software county of origin for troubleshooting guidance.  Software will have the ability to track information previously recorded on all inmates indefinitely.

6.0	Special Consideration (s)

6.1	The requested ICS Inmate Management System requires a software program that provides the look and feel of a Windows graphical user interface, with drop-down screens, pop-up tables, easy-to-click menus, print-from-PC capability, and intuitive displays of information.  Run on Windows 2000 XP workstations and possible server.
•	ICS desires new software to offer an open, regional database format, with a data warehouse strategy.  The objective is to provide the following functionality:

1.	allow comprehensive data collection, retrieval, easy user queries, reporting, and access,
2.	allow limited ability to modify components by specified users, 
3.	Compatibility to other MS software (i.e., Excel, Word, etc.),
4.	easy to customize,
5.	levels of security available; and
6.	potential of growth in the system, into the future
