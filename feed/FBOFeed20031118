The organization of sites and investigators may be formal or informal as long as the network?s collaborative accomplishments can be shown. Observational and outcomes research are considered part of the definition of clinical research.  The NIH is not seeking the development of new networks in this feasibility phase.  Only existing networks will be eligible for award under this solicitation. This is not the actual Request for Proposal - Broad Agency Announcement (RFP/BAA); the RFP/BAA # BAA-NIH-NHLBI-HO-04-23 must be downloaded from the NIH Web Site, which will be available on or about December 2, 2003, at the following address: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/nhlbi/rafs/rfas.htm  The due date for proposal submission is March 5, 2004.

The goal of these security engineering activities is to: (1) reduce the cost and schedule associated with system security certification and authorization (C&A) by integrating Common Criteria and C&A security evaluations, (2) ensure that FAA systems pass the initial C&A in a timely and cost-effective manner,  (3) ensure that FAA systems maintain a stable security posture so that the mandatory tri-annual security C&A activities are successful, and (4) enhance confidence in the security integrity of certified systems. FAA is migrating to the NIST SP 800-37 C&A process and views the formal evaluation activities that will be conducted by the CCTL as an input to this process.  The FAA requires any vendors interested in the FAA Integrated Common Criteria and C&A Security Evaluation (FIC3A) procurement to meet the following requirements: 1)Must be a United States owned and operated company. 2)Have a current as well as a past history of Common Criteria Testing Laboratory accreditation issued by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP).  As part of the NIAP accreditation process, labs must meet the requirements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and comply with the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS). The NIAP accreditation is the primary requirement for becoming a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory. 3)Must have in-depth knowledge of NIST SP 800-37 and experience conducting information system security certification and authorization (C&A) activities. 4)Have experience in Wide Area (backbone telecommunications) Network (WAN) security testing and accreditation. 6)Have experience in mission-critical applications software system security testing and accreditation. The closing date for this announcement is 25 Nov 03.  The estimated date for release of the SIR is o/a 26 Nov 03.

<DESC>This acquisition addresses the merging of Cluster 3, the Maritime and Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and Cluster 4, the Airborne JTRS, programs. This merged program is now referred to as the Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station (AMF) JTRS program. The AMF JTRS program has a two-phase development strategy: Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD) and SDD.  Pre-SDD is focused on the system architectures and initial designs for the AMF JTRS, as well as identifying possible cost-effective hardware and software commonality across the operating domains. The purpose of this fifteen (15) month effort, which will be executed concurrently by two Contractors, is to define system requirements and interface requirements and to proceed with initial development of the AMF JTR Set through Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  Pre-SDD will also include a priced option for design through PDR of the Maritime/Fixed Station Service Integration Kits (SIKs). The preliminary design of each selected Contractor will enable the use of commercial-based products and standards to the maximum extent possible and foster high component commonality, while maintaining maximum flexibility and focusing on minimizing initial capability cost. SDD will be a full and open competition, with options for LRIP.  It will include the post-PDR development of a modular AMF JTRS design and associated form factors.  The AMF JTRS communications system shall support growth, technology refresh, and technology improvement with minimum effect on its installed equipment, software, and platform interfaces.

<DESC>The Fast Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a Creativity & Innovation Program project to develop a finite element analysis tailored to execute on many, concurrently operating processors. The first year of the project (performed by Vanderplaats Research and Development, INc. under NASA purchase order L-71195D ) resulted in a formulation for a FFEA based on the direct minimization of the total elastic strain energy, subject to equilibrium and support restrain constraint. The direct energy minimization was chosen because it may be evaluated on the element-by-element basis for all elements simultaneously thus engaging a large number of processors and achieving near-linear scalability. The formulation was derived in two versions corresponding to the Displacement and Force methods of the classical Finite Element Analysis. NASA/LaRC has a requirement to develop a research finite element code to test the performance of both versions of FFEA to compare them in terms of the accuracy, rate of convergence, and degree of utilization of the concurrent processing (scalability measure). The research code shall be able to analyze stress and displacements of structures whose finite element modeling includes the following types of finite elements: bar, shear panel, plate, and shell. The research code will use the capability described in Reference 1 & 2 below as a means for the direct energy minimization. The code shall be tested first on a serial computer in a multiprocessor simulation mode, and, if the results, warrant it, it will be implemented on a multiprocessor architecture to verify its performance predicted from the single processor simulation.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the analysis services from Vanderplaats Research & Development, Inc. (Vanderplaats) of Colorado Springs, CO because only Vaderplaats is capable of performing very large constrained optimization consisting of millions of variables and millions of constraints simultaneously.  Additionally, Vaderplaats has acquired unique knowledge and expertise arising from the previous purchase order L-71195D which resulted in the theoretical formulation of the algorithm develeped into a new structural analysis technology  that constitutes intellectual property jointly owned by NASA and Vaderplaats.	The government anticipates awarding to Vanderplaats a purchase order for the basic effort to develop a research finite element code; the purchase order will include one (1) option period to execute analysis of a Finite Element Model with no less than one million of elastic degrees of freedom twice: once using the code “Genesis” on a conventional single processor computer to establish a benchmark, and again using the research code on a multiprocessor to determine the elapased time reduction.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 5, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Gregory Lukowski, General Manager, Operations & Engineering, Namibia Airports Company Limited, P.O. Box 23061, G.I.P.F. House, 5th Floor, Windhoek, Namibia, Phone:  264-61-295 5013/5005/6, Fax: 264-61-295-5022, Email: lukow@airports.com.na  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study on behalf of the Namibia Airports Company Limited (NAC) on the technical and economic viability of upgrade projects for the Walvis Bay Airport in Namibia.   

The feasibility study includes an analysis of both short-term and long-term improvements to the airport such as runway rehabilitation, the upgrade of fire and rescue services, development of cargo terminals, and the development of an industrial park around the airport.  The development of the Walvis Bay Airport on both the passenger and cargo sides is a priority for Namibia, as such improvements will facilitate the growth of the Walvis Bay ports, which serve as a catalyst and facilitator to the national industrial base.  Walvis Bay also has the potential to serve as a regional “hub” for the transport of goods, particularly to Botswana and parts of South Africa.  USTDA is also sponsoring a feasibility study on the development of the TransKalahari Corridor on behalf of the Walvis Bay Corridor Group in Namibia.  

The terms of reference (TOR) for this project include four phases:

Phase I: Project Orientation/Information and Data Collection Phase calls for the Consultant to begin to gather the data that exists regarding the NAC regional airports. The consultants will also gather economic and production information on Namibia and on the specific region and catchment area for each airport. 

Phase II: Assessment Phase is designed to document and assess existing conditions based on the information obtained in Phase I.  This includes the existing airport infrastructure, including as-built drawings and construction/installation records, design and specification documents and land use plans will be reviewed and a base line established for the traffic capacity for the current as well as future growth of the airport. The base-line studies will include the environmental impact of the projects on the airports. 

Phase III: Study Development Phase of the study will develop the traffic forecast based on a complete market assessment of both passenger and cargo traffic that might be directed to these regional airports. Based on the market assessment and traffic forecast, the team will begin to develop each area of the airport infrastructure based on the forecast traffic. It will also develop a financial model that is based on the results of the various aspects of the proposed expansion program, business plan and current financial market place, and which will be used for discussion with potential lenders/investors. 

Phase IV: A Financing and Feasibility Study will identify possible financing options, financial institutions, and the final costing of the proposed expansion program. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $381,260 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, local time on January 12, 2004 at the above address. Any proposal received after the deadline will be returned unopened.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.

<SUBJECT>B -- Romania: National Forestry Cadastre Project
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0370046A

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Adam Craciunescu; Secretary of State; Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment; Government of Romania; 1, Victoriei Square, District 1; Bucharest, Romania; Phone: 40-21-410-24-07; Fax: 40-21-335-60-57.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the proposed National Forestry Cadastre Project in Romania.

Romania is the second largest country in Southeast Eruope with 27 % of its total surface (237,500 sq km) covered by forests.  As such, the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Water and Environment is tasked with the challenge of managing the use of forestry lands and protecting the overall health of the forests.  

The proposed feasibility study would evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of establishing a national cadastre system with the use of GIS technology to manage Romania’s forests.  The study would assist the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Water and Environment (MAFWE) in achieving two primary goals: (1) implementing a national cadastre system using GIS technology for forestry land; and (2) utilizing the same GIS technology to achieve a sustainable forest ecosystem through the large-scale introduction of biological forest pest control methods.  

Once the study is complete, the project would be implemented in two phases.  Phase I is a pilot program to be installed at the Research and Management Institute for Forestry (ICAS) facilities outside Bucharest.  During the pilot stage, the structure of the central cadastre database would be defined (which would serve as the prototype for the regional databases to be created in Phase II), precise contents and standards for the property database would be established, and linkage protocols between the two databases would be created.  Issues such as map objects and requirements, workstation configuration for end-users, and training needs would also be resolved.  The pilot installation would enable ICAS staff to become familiar with the equipment and applications, to establish operational standards, and to assess compatibility issues with the national cadastre prior to rolling the system out on a national level in Phase II. 

Similarly, the establishment of a biological pest control lab as part of Phase I is seen as a necessary precursor to large-scale application of the new treatment methods on the Romanian forests to be developed in Phase II.  A separate GIS level can be created to accommodate the laboratory data.  In this case, by overlaying the forest land plan with the parcels of different owners and the map of forestry contamination and/or past treatments, it would be possible to show the degree of pest infestation or type of pollution and determine appropriate measures of action.  The system would also make it possible to prepare a certificate of the degree of pollution/infestation for land owners/users, as well as to make recommendations on the management of these lands.     

The Feasibility Study is divided into two parts.  Results of the study should provide the MAFWE with guidelines and solutions for the following:

Part I - Architecture of the National Cadastre System for Forestry Land and specific GIS applications: concept and structure of the National Cadastre System for Forestry Land and GIS applications in forestry, and an implementation strategy for the system.

Part II - Creation of a National Laboratory for Biological Forest Pest Control: concept and structure of the National Laboratory for Biological Forest Pest Control and development of a national strategy for large-scale introduction of biological pest control methods.

The Ministry realizes that the two parts of the Feasibility Study are distinct and require different competencies; though, both parts require the use of GIS technology and could be integrated into the same system.   

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $175,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The 11t Contracting Squadron, Bolling AFB DC intends to award a simplified acquisition purchase order on a sole source basis to Verizon Federal Inc.  The purpose of this procurement is for the renewal of Bolling's annual Internet subscription service.  The requirement is being acquired Sole Source based on the proprietary rights established by the Verizon telecommunication network currently in use. Replacing Verizon’s  phone lines would allow other Internet service providers to compete and provide service, but this is a costly solution and would need to be done annually to foster a competitive environment for vendors.  The option to replace phone lines annually is not in the best interest of the government and therefore not a viable solution.  Award of this solicitation will be made on or about 09 DEC 03.  NAICS Code: 518111.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

These investigations often involve details of the individual's life and must be conducted with tact and discretion.  Information collected as parts of BIs is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974.   

The work performed will be limited to non-personal services as augmentation support to the BI program.  This work is to be performed in direct support of the OPM.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of personnel to conduct quality law enforcement record searches from existing database terminals as part of background investigations. The record searchers must update PIPS (Personnel Investigations Processing System), complete the investigative voucher, or provide printouts to OPM.   The Independent Contractor must be able to conduct work, law enforcement record searches, within at the designated terminals in the state of South Carolina.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The contractor will be expected to provide anti-terrorism (AT) capabilities against potential weapons of mass destruction (WMD) events at approximately 185 CONUS installations and 15 OCONUS installations.  The IPP capability consists of Chemical, Bio logical, Radiological, and Nuclear  (CBRN) detection, identification, warning, reporting, decision support, individual protection, collective protection, decontamination, medical countermeasures, medical diagnostics, and medical surveillance components and  will be tailored to the needs and composition of each IPP site to include the provision of one year of sustainment.   The IPP scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to provide for several functional areas, including:  Management, planning, and responsibility for total systems performance of each installation's CBRN design; Development of the Systems Architecture and requisite  systems specifications required for the IPP to produce the capabilities documented in the Urgent Requirements Capabilities Document (URCD) and Initial Systems Architecture; Procurement of COTS chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense equipm ent; Integration of COTS, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), and GFI into a systems solution; Development and integration of the system's Command and Control (C2) architecture into the installation's Command, Control, Co mmunications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) network for installation protection and emergency responder control.  This includes installation, fielding, and sustainment for one year of the complete IPP system at every installation; Integrated Logistics S upport (ILS) to include training, spares, Acquisition Logistics Support (ALS)/Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for one year, quality control, including configuration management, adherence to standards and specifications, and system acceptance and sustain ment; Testing and Evaluation (T&E), in accordance with the Overarching Test Concept Plan (OTCP); development and use of engineering models and simulations using analytical data tools as required; updating the system architecture with new technology as it b ecomes available; providing support for installation development of CONOPS, Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding (MOAs or MOUs), and other operational coordination support required at each installation to accommodate the CBRN capabilities provided under  the IPP. The Government anticipates the award of one (1) contract under full and open competition.  This contract will be awarded as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract with Cost Reimbursable Materials and Travel.  Direction will be given to the LSI via Technical  Directives (TDs).

This contract is planned to be issued  for a three-year base period of performance with the potential for three (3) one-year Award Term extensions. The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors.  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  In order to be considered for award, o fferors must possess a SECRET facility security clearance.  It is anticipated that this acquisition will preclude foreign participation at the prime level only. The Draft RFP W9113M-04-R-0005 is scheduled to be released on or about 19 November 2003.

<CONTACT>Melissa McPherson Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.McPherson@mms.gov;
<DESC>The following questions and their respective answers are hereby provided for all Offerors.  Please note that no further questions are being accepted or answered. Question 1: Can a minority, for-profit company who is partnered with a national non-profit African-American Women?s organization with multiple chapters in states across the U.S. working collaboratively with local faith-based groups in their communities be the prime for this work?  Answer 1: As indicated in the RFP, the prime for this work must either be a national faith-based organization OR be collaborating with a national faith-based organization. Question 2: How many participants are expected to take part in the program?  Answer 2: There is not a specified number. Applicants are encouraged to estimate how many participants are anticipated. Question 3: How many participants are expected to take part per individual site? Answer 3: There is not a specified number. Applicants are encouraged to estimate how many participants are anticipated. Questions 4: Are site leaders expected to meet in one location for the one-day training or can the training take place online via virtual training?  Answer 4: A meeting in one location is preferred; however, Offerors may propose as they choose. Question 5: Does the contractor have to be a faith-based organization? Answer 5: See response to Question 1. Question 6: Under Section C item 1, it state[s] that each program shall be implemented at 25 faith-based sites throughout the United States.  Please clarify whether it is the Government's intention that the offeror would establish a contractual relationship with the 25 faith-based sites.  Answer 6: It is not required; whether or not a prime wished to subcontract to sites would be at its discretion. Question 7: Under Section F (3), deliverables 18 to 22 relate to activities that will be implemented in the faith-based sites by the site leads and volunteer help.  Would the Government consider rewording these deliverables to more accurately reflect the level of control the offeror would have over the work.  For example: Deliverable 18:  Provide support and all materials to enable sites to begin the first of the bi-monthly educational sessions. Answer 7: The deliverables remain unchanged. Question 8: Under Section C (IV)(B)(1&2), please confirm that the offeror should budget for only the costs of development of program materials.  If this is not the case, please provide estimates for the number of participants and amount of program materials to be produced and distributed.  In addition, please provide guidance regarding the minimum number of participants at each the site. Answer 8: There is not a specified number. Applicants are encouraged to estimate how many participants are anticipated. Question 9: Under Section C (IV) (B) (1), it states that each site shall be given compensation for their involvement (individual site leader stipend or site donation).  What program costs (i.e. printing and distribution of promotional & participant materials, participants' prizes and incentives) are to be covered by the compensation?  Please provide an estimate for the amount of the compensation for each site or site leader.  Answer 9: These estimates should be provided by the Offeror based on their proposed methodology to complete the work. Question 10:   Does the government anticipate the need for OMB clearance for data collection on the participants at the 25 faith-based sites?  If yes, what role do you anticipate for the offeror in obtaining that clearance? Answer 10: We do not anticipate the need for OMB Clearance.   Question 11: In Section L (3) (D), it states that the offeror should "Describe its specific experience related to the development of a comprehensive campaign aimed to help women either as a national faith-based institution itself or in collaboration with a national faith-based institution."  Does the Government consider that it is critical for a successful offeror to have experience executing comprehensive campaigns aimed to help women in faith-based institutions, or would the Government consider as relevant other work in faith-based institutions helping men and women, and/or work helping women in other settings?  How many specific references for previous work of this nature with contact information should the offeror submit? Answer 11: All examples cited are relevant. There is no limit on the specific references to previous work; however, there is a page limitation. Question 12: In Section L (3), Preparation of Proposals, it states that the technical proposal is limited to a total of fifty (50) front-and-back 8 ½ by 11 paper. Please clarify that this means 50 sheets of 8½ x 11 paper, double-sided (100 printed pages).  Can staff resumes be included in an appendix to the technical proposal not to be included in the page count? Answer 12: The page limit for proposals is fifty (50) pages TOTAL.  This means a total of 25 printed pages which are double sided.  Staff resumes can be included in the appendix. Question 13: In amendment 2, it states that this solicitation will result in the award of one or more contracts based on proposals received.  Should more than one contract be awarded, please confirm whether $200,000-$300,000 would be allocated to each contract or split among the awardees.  Answer 13: The range for one contract is $200,000-$300,000.  If more than one contract is awarded, the total amount for all contracts combined will not be more than $500,000.   Questions 14 (a) through (c): In the Business Proposal instructions contained in Solicitation Section L.3., it states offerors should provide "a matrix showing labor hours per person, by tasks with separate lines for estimated materials and other direct costs is required."  The Business Proposal instructions also state under Item #3 that offerors should provide "a breakdown of direct labor rates by named person or labor category including number of labor-hours and current actual rate.  Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used."  As we would like to ensure that we are providing the labor rate information in an appropriate, compliant format in order to assist the Government in evaluating offerors' proposals, please clarify how offerors should present their anticipated costs for this project, specifically:   Question 14 (a): Should offerors budget actual labor costs for each position/individual proposed, or should loaded labor rates for each proposed labor category be budgeted?  Answer 14 (a): Offerors should propose fully loaded labor rates. Question 14 (b):	 Please clarify how the labor rates should be calculated, i.e., should labor rates be fully loaded rates inclusive of labor, fringe, applicable overhead and fee?  Answer 14 (b) Labor rates should be fully loaded inclusive of labor, fringe, applicable overhead and fee. Question 14 (c): Please confirm that offerors may budget costs for estimated materials and other direct costs inclusive of all applicable indirect costs and fee, as per each organization's cost structure.  Answer 14 (c): Offerors shall propose all budgeted costs for estimated materials without burdens.  Any indirect costs and fee should be separately priced. Question 15: Depending on how an organization calculates fringe benefit/leave costs, an organization's standard work-hours per year can vary.  For example, some organizations calculate 1,800 work-hours per year, while others utilize 2,010 hours, or 2,080 hours per year.  Therefore, how many hours per work-year should offerors assume in preparing their labor costs by labor category?  Should offerors follow their respective personnel policies pertaining to the number of hours worked per year (provided the details/assumptions of that policy are clearly noted in the proposal), or should a standard number of work-hours per year be utilized by all potential offerors, so that labor rates are more readily comparable for proposal evaluations? Answer 15: Offerors should assume 1,860 work-hours per year in preparing their labor costs by labor category. Question 16: The Business Proposal instructions ask for a matrix showing labor hours per person, by tasks, with separate lines for estimated materials and other direct costs.  The scope of work in the RFP is broken out by phase, not task.  We note that there is no reference to tasks in the scope of work. Please confirm that the proposed budget and matrix should correspond with the phases of work. Answer 16: Yes, the proposed budget and matrix should correspond with the phases of work, and be broken down by tasks within each phase.

The revised anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about December 1, 2003.

Replace the current description to read as follows:

The Federal Motor Carrier Administration (FMCSA) intends to award a competitively solicited contract on an unrestricted basis for the following support. The resultant contract type is expected to be a firm-fixed price contract. The proposed contract will include a base period from date of award through September 30, 2003 (including a Transition period not to exceed 90 days from the date of award).  Four full one-year options following the initial base period will also be included. The purpose of this effort is to promote the public safety intents of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA) and to implement the requirements of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 (MCSIA) to improve the administration of the Federal motor carrier safety program and reduce the number and severity of large truck involved crashes through effective commercial driver’s license testing, record keeping and sanctions. These purposes are to be accomplished by identifying vulnerabilities in the CDL program in regard to fraud and security and implementing and monitoring measures to correct these problems by making improvements to the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of CDL data transmission within States and between States; and by identifying and implementing measures to improve the effectiveness and security of the CDL program at the national and State levels. Accomplishing these purposes will also include working with countries with commercial driver’s licenses recognized by the U.S. as comparable to a U.S. CDL and thus valid in the U.S. by assisting development, operation and improvements of information systems in these countries; to promote interactive electronic interconnection between such foreign information systems and the U.S.; and to make this information available interactively to all authorized users for use in their ongoing operations to prevent issuance of a license to a disqualified driver, or more than one license to a driver, and to prevent unqualified and disqualified drivers and motor carriers from operating commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in the U.S. In accomplishing the objectives of the resultant contract, the successful offeror will:  Operate FMCSA’s 52nd State application to associate US convictions of Mexican CMV operators to create a US driver history on each such driver, impose US federal disqualification action against Mexican drivers as required by the FMCSA. Develop and operate 53rd State application to associate US convictions of Canadian CMV operators to create a US driver history on each such driver, impose US federal disqualification action against Canadian drivers as required by the FMCSA. Provide other areas of specialized assistance relative to specific tasks as requested by FMCSA. The solicitation for this effort should be posted to FEDBIZOPS on or before December 01, 2003 with responses due by December 31, 2003.

6.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall result in a corresponding increase in the time afforded to Charterer to accept delivery of the Vessel.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  See paragraph IV(ae) for additional requirements, although the requirements of COMSC instruction 5530.3 shall apply only to time charters of six months or longer.   

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: IMMUNIZATIONS. (U.S.-flag only)

(1)  U.S. flag time chartered vessel services are considered essential contractor services to the Department of Defense in support of military and associated support missions.  As a result, Masters, officers, crewmembers, and other individuals who are embarked on such vessels for Owner’s purposes, including but not limited to subcontractors, are considered contractor personnel performing mission essential services under DODI 3020.37, November 6, 1990, (Change 1, January 26, 1996), and are subject to the following:

    a.  Masters, officers, crewmembers and other individuals, as described above, who are embarked on any vessel subject to this charter must be medically pre-screened and immunized in accordance with Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) policy, and any changes thereto, in effect or made during the period of this charter, including any options or extensions.  Owner shall ensure that all Masters, Officers, crewmembers, and other individuals embarked on any vessel subject to this charter comply with all such immunization programs.  Notification of immunization requirements pursuant to this section shall be provided to Owner by the Contracting Officer.

    b.  When immunizations are required pursuant to this clause, Owner must provide notification, as directed by the Contracting Officer, of the immunization status of all embarked personnel within 24 hours of fixture or award.  Further, at any time during the contract period, the immunization status of any relief personnel scheduled to board the vessel is required no later than 96 hours prior to the personnel change, unless authorized otherwise by the Contracting Officer.

    c.  Any Master, officer, crewmember or other individual who refuses to comply with the immunization requirements, or who is ineligible for a particular required immunization as provided herein, shall be removed by Owner from the vessel as soon as possible, but not later than the next port call unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, and replaced with personnel who either have the required immunization or are eligible and will comply with the policy.  Any removal and replacement of personnel pursuant to this clause shall be solely at Owner’s expense, including, but not limited to, travel, per diem, wages and associated administrative expenses.

    d.  Crew shortages resulting from the application of this section may subject the vessel to being placed off-hire.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  His Excellency Ilie Sarbu, Minister, Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment, Government of Romania, 1 Victoreiei Sqaure District 1, Bucharest, Romania, Phone: (40) 21 410 24 07, Fax: (40) 21 335 60 57.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the development and deployment of an Integrated Water Resources Management System (IWAREMS).

The water resources in Romania are characterized by their unequal distribution.  Romania is a large territory (232,000 km) with a fairly large population (22 million), which presents a challenge to the Romanian Government in securing the necessary water resources for users dispersed throughout the country.  Over the past 200 years, Romania has developed a complex water system consisting of hundreds of hydrotechnical structures.  However, in recent years, Romania has experienced heavy rains that have led to flash floods.  This has severely taxed the existing antiquated water management system and has led to numerous fatalities and economic losses in excess of $20 million per year, a problem that has been compounded by industrial water pollution. Coupled with the inherent problems of an emerging economy, these issues are a threat to the Romanian social foundation and highlight the need to revise the existing water control and monitoring systems. 

The Government of Romania (GOR) initially responded to these challenges through the launch of a National Integrated Meteorological System (SIMIN) followed by a Destructive Waters (DESWAT) pilot project.  SIMIN is a weather radar project that generates meteorological data for rapid and automatic input to flood modeling systems.  This is important because it provides useful forecasts that allow citizens and businesses ample time to prepare for floods.

The DESWAT project, funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, is a hydrological project designed to assess and deploy computer models used to investigate and forecast flood conditions in large and small river basins.  The success of this Feasibility Study has led to a $64 million investment (secured by a sovereign guarantee) to implement DESWAT.  This implies a significant upgrading of Romania’s hydrological monitoring system, enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response to serious flood conditions.

Building upon SIMIN and DESWAT, the meteorological and hydrological predicting projects respectively, the Ministry of Waters and Environmental Protection is now planning to set up and deploy WATMAN.  WATMAN will use the data provided through the input of SIMIN and DESWAT and will integrate that data with other actors to create a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.

The development and deployment of the IWAREMS system will be a part of an overall Water Management (WATMAN) system that will assist Romania in creating a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.  WATMAN is one of Romania’s largest projects to date in the water sector.  It is important because it represents the culmination of a number of previous feasibility studies and pilot programs regarding water management.  The WATMAN system will integrate all of the information related to river basins in Romania and will include all relevant actors- water agencies, industrial, urban, and agricultural users- within a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.    

The development of WATMAN is critical, based on the requirements laid forth by the European Union (EU), a body that Romania aspires to join by 2007 and that requires all members to have a national strategy for water resources management. 

WATMAN will be implemented in three phases.  The first of which would be a USTDA-funded Feasibility Study on the equipment and components of IWAREMS and an economic analysis of the existing water management system.  The second study, to be funded by USAID, will cover specific modeling for eleven Romanian hydrological basins within the WATMAN system.  The third phase will be the implementation of the first two phases, including implementation on a national scale and the finalization of a Romanian water management system.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $517,960 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, DECEMBER 30, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Modification 0002: This modification is being issued to change the due date for company support documentation and to add additional information to this Request for Information (RFI).  The due date for vendor's support documentation is changed to December 5, 2003.  Request the vendors submit documentation that responds to NOAA's needs within this RFI and the modifications.  The following paragraph is being added as additional information:  NOAA's National Weather Service serves mission related weather information to the public via Internet web servers.  For the past few months, NWS has experimented in using Internet Map Server technologies to both display this information and to serve it to via OpenGIS standards to partners.  Usage patterns for NWS information on the Internet vary depending on weather affecting different parts of the county, often resulting in millions of hits per day.  Our primary interest in this RFI is to better understand available software platforms that can handle this level of traffic in a Linux based environment distributed across several geographically separated web farms.  (End of Modification)  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to find companies that can support the following requirement.  The NWS is researching for companies who can provide information on Internet Mapping Services (IMS) technology based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that conform to OpenGIS Specifications.  Specifically, NWS is seeking information on IMS technologies that run on the Linux operating system, can support infrastructures to handle millions of web requests (hits) per day, and support industry standard formats like shapefiles.  The system should be able to support interactions with ralational databases, including open source databases like MySQL and PostgresSQL.  If you are a company that can support the NWS's needs stated in this RFI, request you submit the support documentation electronically to Robert.Bunge@noaa.gov and copy the primary point of contact in this RFI.  This RFI will close on November 28, 2003.  This RFI announcement is for market research purposes, only.

<DESC>The 341st Contacting Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Great Falls, MT, is seeking sources to create and administer a social norms-based program that promotes a cultural change by reinforcing responsible alcohol use among the local Air Force population.  The program shall measure the behaviors, perceptions and attitudes of Malmstrom AFB personnel with regard to alcohol use and related behaviors.  Generally, the target demographics will be high school educated male military members, age 19-25, who are pursuing higher education degrees; however, any personnel with base access can be included in the program.  The project duration will be six-months with the results and subsequent intervention plan presented to Malmstrom AFB leadership.  This project will include a report that highlights key findings and a strategic plan outlining potential interventions based upon the program data.  The results will be used as a baseline to test the effectiveness of future interventions.  The program will be tailored for the Air Force based on the Social Norms Theory identified below. "This theory holds that if students perceive something to be the norm, they tend to alter their behavior to fit that norm, even if it isn't reality.  If, however, they are presented with the actual norm, they will conform to it.   So if students think heavy drinking is normal they'll drink more.  If they think responsible drinking is normal, they'll drink more responsibly" -Michael Haines, Northern Illinois University.   The reference number affixed to this announcement is for convenience and tracking purposes only.  When responding, use the reference number and address it to the 341st Contracting Squadron, attention 1Lt Patrick Carr.  This solicitation is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.

This cartridge matches the trajectory of standard 5.56mm    combat ammunition out to 25 Meters while having a maximum range of no    greater than 250 Meters. This allows realistic training at sites where    range restrictions prohibit the firing of standard 5.56mm ammunition.    The M862 cartridge is used in the M16 family of weapons and requires   the use of a modified weapon bolt, (the M2 training bolt) which   converts the M16 from a gas-operated weapon to a blowback operation.   The cartridge shall conform to the requirements of the M862   Performance Specification. Only those cartridge designs which   have previously been qualified by the government in accordance   with the M862 performance specification shall be considered.    The approximate quantities will be as follows:    FY 04 (two ranges)(a)1M cartridges-1.349M (b)1.35M-1.55M cartridges;    FY05(three ranges)(a)800K-1.099M cartridges  (b)1.1M-1.799M cartridges     (c)1.8M-2M cartridges; FY06(three ranges) (a)800K-1.1.099M cartridges     (b)1.1M-1.799M cartridges  (c)1.8M-2M cartridges; FY07(three ranges)    (a)800K-1.099M cartridges  (b)1.1M-1.799M cartridges  (c)1.8M-2M   cartridges. The Government could need any of the ranges, combination   of them or all of them included in the same fiscal year. Delivery will   be required to be made within 180 days from award of contract.    The Government also requests that interested sources submit a    Rough Order of Magnitude(ROM) estimate for all quantities. All   responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their    capabilities/qualification data and ROM in regard to the above    no later than December 10, 2003. Submittal of information is requested    via electronic mail only to Louisa Meléndez: melendez@pica.army.mil.   All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to   the Government. Please include company name, address, telephone   number, email address, technical point of contact, Company Size    (please specify as either Large, Foreign, Small, Small Disadvantaged,    8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business    Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small    Business, brochures/literature. This is only a Market Survey, not a    pre-solicitation notice. If a formal solicitation is generated at a    later date, a solicitation notice will be published. Respondents must    demonstrate a capability for high rate production and delivery of    these cartridges. Any non-qualified sources who would be interested in    submitting a proposal, will be responsible to qualify their round at    their own expense in order to be considered for award. In order to   be eligible to compete for the award, a cartridge must be fully   qualified by the closing date of the formal solicitation.     See Numbered Note 25.

<SUBJECT>B--Office of Subsistence Management, Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program, Notice of Availability of Funding, 2005 Request for Study Proposals.
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Subsistence Management, administers the Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program (Catalog of Federal and Domestic Assistance Pseudo Code # 15.FFA).  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program funds technically sound projects addressing priority subsistence fishery issues.  The program funds projects that gather information to manage and conserve subsistence fishery resources.  The program also develops fisheries management expertise within Alaska Native and rural organizations and promotes collaboration among Federal, State, Alaska Native and local organizations.  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program encompasses awards made through both federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This "call for proposals" is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  A twin posting of this announcement of request for proposals # 701814R003 has been  posted on http://www.grants.gov  Utilizing the analysis factors set forth in the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977, the Office of Subsistence Management and Regional Contracting Officers will determine which study proposals are funded via Procurement Instruments (i.e. Purchase Orders and Contracts) and which are funded via Federal Assistance (i.e. Cooperative Agreements). The Office of Subsistence Management invites the submission of new and continuing proposals for fisheries investigation studies to be initiated under the 2005 Fisheries Resource Monitoring Plan.  This is the initial announcement for this funding opportunity.  As in past years, we will consider studies that gather, analyze, and report information needed for effective subsistence fisheries management on federal conservation units in Alaska (National Wildlife Refuges, National Forests, National Parks and Preserves, National Conservation Areas, National Wild and Scenic River Systems, National Petroleum Reserves, and National Recreation Areas).  Study proposals of up to 3 years duration will be considered.  Study proposals are to be submitted to the Office of Subsistence Management by January 26, 2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of Hybrid Wavelength Calibration Instrument
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Jonathan Kofler to build and characterize a hybrid wavelength calibration instrument.  The work will mostly be conducted at the NIST Boulder Laboratory site in Boulder, Colorado.  Because of the complexity of the work to be performed, we require a person who is familiar with NIST hybrid wavelength calibration reference, including writing interleaved, sampled fiber Bragg gratings, designing electronic circuits for controlling the gratings, stabilizing these grating peaks to molecular absorption lines, measuring the peak wavelengths, and modeling subtle effects of instrument resolution on peak wavelength.  This knowledge will be used to complete the following tasks:
1)	Package hybrid wavelength reference into instrument box with basic user interface (components and detailed design provided by NIST).	
2)	Test hybrid wavelength reference instrument; measure the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) peak wavelengths in the 850, 1300, and 1550 nm regions and begin wavelength stability measurements of selected peaks.	
3)	Develop a users manual for the hybrid wavelength reference instrument.
4)	Complete the wavelength stability measurements of selected peaks, deliver hybrid wavelength reference instrument to the Navy Primary Standards Laboratory (NPSL) in San Diego, and train NPSL personnel in the use of the instrument.
5)	Develop apparatus to write more symmetric FBG peaks.
6)	Write and characterize FBGs made with improved writing apparatus.
7)	Model and quantify effect of residual FBG asymmetry on hybrid wavelength reference peak determination.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.  Based on the market research conducted, Jonathan Kofler is the only vendor who can meet these requirements.  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Any contractors doing business with the Government must now be registered with the Central Contractor Registry.  The web site is http://www.ccr.gov/.  Agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm. Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred).  Anticipated award date is December 5, 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research Registry for Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five (5) years.  The CHMC was originally awarded a five (5) year contract in September, 1994, for the project entitled “Research Registry for Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.”  The purpose of the contract was to establish a research registry for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).  The Contractor developed, maintains, and systematically updates a disease registry for JRA with the focus on multicase families with affected sib pairs.  In conjunction with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, the CHMC continuously promotes the use of the Registry as a national resource to facilitate research by providing adequate numbers of subjects for study, thus enhancing the national research effort in childhood arthritis.  The purpose of this extension is four fold.  First, the additional time will allow the incumbent to continue to enroll affected sib pairs to meet its enrollment goals and to follow-up the sib pairs.  Second, it will allow for enrollment of multiplex and simplex families to include under-represented JRA subtypes and under-represented ethnicities long-term follow-up of sib pairs with JRA.  Third, to carry out pilot studies exploring the relationships of observed genetic linkage or associations with observed clinical features of disease and disease pathogenesis using novel technologies such as proteomic profiling using mass spectrometry.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The  CHMC is determined to be the only responsible source for the following reasons: (1) the CHMC leads a unique national effort dedicated to the collection and characterization of JRA sib pairs and is in a unique position to enroll simplex and multiplex families; (2) the CHMC has developed and implemented a system for sib pair accrual, based on strict enrollment criteria; and (3) the CHMC has unique invaluable resources at its disposal such as 197 sib pairs from 179 families, DNA from 155 families, 425 simplex families, and 69 Hispanic simplex families and comprehensive clinical data, including quantitative trait data on all patients, including therapeutic history.  Therefore, the CHMC has the unique capability to perform this work.  This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS OPTO-ACOUSTIC RECANALIZATION SYSTEM
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS OPTO-ACOUSTIC RECANALIZATION SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks licensees to commercialize its opto-acoustic recanalization (OAR) system.

LLNL’s OAR System is directed to the removal of blockages in tubular tissues and organs.  More specifically, it relates to the removal of intravascular occlusions such as antherosclerotic plaque or thrombus.

The OAR technology utilizes an optically activated transducer for generating acoustic vibrations in a biological medium. Energy for operating the transducer is provided optically by laser light. Pulsed laser light is absorbed in the working fluid of the transducer to generate a thermal pressure creating adiabatic expansion of the transducer head such that it does work against the ambient medium.

The transducer returns to its original state by a process of thermal cooling. The motion of the transducer within the ambient medium transmits acoustic energy into the medium. By pulsing the laser at a high repetition rate, an ultrasonic radiation field can be established locally in the medium. This method of producing ultrasonic vibrations can be used in vivo for the treatment of stroke-related conditions, particularly for dissolving thrombus. The catheter may also incorporate anti-thrombolytic drug treatments as an adjunct therapy and it may be operated in conjunction with ultrasonic detection equipment for imaging and feedback control.

LLNL has a portfolio of patents that cover this technology: 
U. S. Patent 5,944,687, “Opto-Acoustic Transducer for Medical Applications”, issued 8/31/99; 
U. S. Patent 6,022,309, “Opto-Acoustic Thrombolysis”, issued 2/8/00; 
U. S. Patent 6,538,739, “Bubble Diagnostics”, issued 3/25/03; and 
U. S. Patent 6,368,318, “Opto-Acoustic Recanalization Delivery System”, issued 4/9/02.  Foreign rights are available in selected countries.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's opto-acoustic recanalization system should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.


Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO61-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in developing and commercializing LLNL's opto-acoustic recanalization technology.

6.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall result in a corresponding increase in the time afforded to Charterer to accept delivery of the Vessel.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  See paragraph IV(ae) for additional requirements, although the requirements of COMSC instruction 5530.3 shall apply only to time charters of six months or longer.   

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: IMMUNIZATIONS. (U.S.-flag only)

(1)  U.S. flag time chartered vessel services are considered essential contractor services to the Department of Defense in support of military and associated support missions.  As a result, Masters, officers, crewmembers, and other individuals who are embarked on such vessels for Owner’s purposes, including but not limited to subcontractors, are considered contractor personnel performing mission essential services under DODI 3020.37, November 6, 1990, (Change 1, January 26, 1996), and are subject to the following:

    a.  Masters, officers, crewmembers and other individuals, as described above, who are embarked on any vessel subject to this charter must be medically pre-screened and immunized in accordance with Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) policy, and any changes thereto, in effect or made during the period of this charter, including any options or extensions.  Owner shall ensure that all Masters, Officers, crewmembers, and other individuals embarked on any vessel subject to this charter comply with all such immunization programs.  Notification of immunization requirements pursuant to this section shall be provided to Owner by the Contracting Officer.

    b.  When immunizations are required pursuant to this clause, Owner must provide notification, as directed by the Contracting Officer, of the immunization status of all embarked personnel within 24 hours of fixture or award.  Further, at any time during the contract period, the immunization status of any relief personnel scheduled to board the vessel is required no later than 96 hours prior to the personnel change, unless authorized otherwise by the Contracting Officer.

    c.  Any Master, officer, crewmember or other individual who refuses to comply with the immunization requirements, or who is ineligible for a particular required immunization as provided herein, shall be removed by Owner from the vessel as soon as possible, but not later than the next port call unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, and replaced with personnel who either have the required immunization or are eligible and will comply with the policy.  Any removal and replacement of personnel pursuant to this clause shall be solely at Owner’s expense, including, but not limited to, travel, per diem, wages and associated administrative expenses.

    d.  Crew shortages resulting from the application of this section may subject the vessel to being placed off-hire.
