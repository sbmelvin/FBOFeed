THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to University of Utah, Genetic Science Learning Center, 75 South 2000 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, to provide expertise in hosting, planning, developing, implementing and evaluating a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program. 



Background Information:
In the spring of 2005, ECIB, in conjunction with the University of Washington, held the first annual Community Genetics Forum. The goals of this Forum were: to engage Northwest communities in dialogue about genetics and the ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research (ELSI); to create a forum and environment for future dialogue independent of federal sponsorship; and to create a model community engagement program and supportive materials that would be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a public genetics forum with community outreach in their respective communities. More than 300 members of the public participated in three days of activities.

In September of 2006, the second annual Community Genetics Forum was held in North Carolina, in collaboration with the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The goals of this Forum were to engage communities across North Carolina, including African American communities, Hispanic communities, and student and faculty audiences from North Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

The 2007 Community Genetics Forum was hosted by the University of Michigan (UM). UM engaged successfully with National Community Committee (NCC) organizations across five states in the Midwest (Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois). Five forums were held on October 12, 2007 in each of the locations, and they were connected by videoconferencing. 

Geographic Region:
In an effort to reach different geographic areas of the country, the NHGRI has selected DHHS regions VIII and IX as appropriate locations for the next Forum. This upcoming Forum should seek to engage communities from one or more locations from this region.  This region is defined to include:  Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and republic of Palau.

Purpose and Objective:
The purpose of this forum is to allow NHGRI to directly engage with community organizations around topics related to genetics and health.   The Forum is a community engagement project, focused on developing partnerships between NHGRI, community based organizations and educating the public on topics related to genetics.  The materials developed and examples set by previous Forums should be used to shape this current Forum.

The Community Genetics Forum project is to be a collaborative effort between NHGRI and the contractor. It is expected that the NHGRI’s Education and Community Involvement Branch will participate actively in the planning and development of the program and that members of the NHGRI will participate in the Forum itself, as appropriate.

Contractor Requirements:
The contractor will provide and/or conduct a range of services and activities leading to the planning of the public forum with community outreach.  These services and activities include:
•	Creating opportunities for the target communities to provide input and/or feedback on the planning of the Forum.
•	Determining the format and agenda for the Forum, based on community input, no later than 6 months before the planned date.
•	Determining what materials will be collected and created from the Forum.
•	Implementing the marketing plan as described in the project proposal

•	Providing a final registration report and a final attendance report to the NHGRI no later than one month after the forum. This report should include demographic information on attendees.
•	Providing forum speakers with an honorarium, as appropriate.
•	Establishing and handling a scholarship fund and/or reimbursement fund for the community outreach activities and Forum participants, as appropriate.
•	Providing reimbursements to forum speakers and participants within two weeks of receiving the voucher.
•	Providing the NHGRI with a final report of the community outreach activities and the Forum no later than three months after the last data collection activity. 

During the course of this task, a representative from the selected organization will communicate twice monthly with a representative from the NHGRI. This communication can take the form of a phone call or e-mail and will provide the NHGRI with regular updates on the progress of the activities identified above, as well as others that will be conducted as part of the development and implementation process of this project. The twice monthly communication will also serve as an opportunity for problem solving and strategizing throughout the collaboration, including the development and implementation phase. The organization’s representative and an NHGRI representative will establish a schedule for the twice monthly communication.

Deliverables:
The deliverables from the contractor is to provide fact sheets and other appropriate public education materials to support the Forum. Also, provide a Forum event, open to the public, discussing aspects of genetics that are of importance and relevant to attendees.  The contractor will provide final reports for the community outreach activities, the Forum, registration and attendance to NHGRI.

Therefore, this is a unique location to carry out this Forum, and to develop sustainable methods for community outreach genetics. This combination of education and engagement expertise makes the GSLC uniquely qualified.

Therefore, an award to any other source is not feasible or practical. The contract will be awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 - Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>ss00-06-40002
<ARCHDATE>07312009
<DESC>Project Identification:

OCOMM’s Broadcast Center produces an average of 150 hours of video per year.  We typically store this video for up to two years in cases of long lived video programs.
Currently, we operate an Avid Unity Isis storage and retrieval system of 32 Terabytes storage.  This system interfaces with our Avid Interplay data management software.    The system has been in place since November 2008 when our Avid Upgrade component of the HD Expansion Project was completed.  In the space of  6 months, we have filled the storage bins to the point where we have only 54 hours of storage space is remaining.  We need to upgrade and expand this storage capability dramatically and quickly.  By purchasing the following items, the Broadcast Center feels it would have a viable plan that would serve our needs in video projects for the next 5 years.  

This justification is in support of the following equipment upgrade to OCOMM’s ISIS Storage and Retrieval System in the Broadcast Center:

Upgrade to ISIS 2.0

-Sixteen i2000 Storage Blades for replacing i500 Storage Blades in Existing
Engine (Requires return of 16 500GB Storage Blades) (open market item)
-Two iSS2000 Integrated Switch Blades for Converting a Single Engine
with iSS1000 Integrated Switch Blades (Requires return of 2 iSS1000
Switch Blades) (open market item)
-Two iXS2000 Integrated Switch Blades for Converting a Single Engine 
with iXS1000 Integrated Switch Blades (Requires return of 2 iXS1000
Switch Blades) (open market item)
-Avid Unity ISIS i2000 Storage Blade with 2TB Capacity (open market item) 
-Avid Unity ISIS i1000 Storage Blade with 1TB Capacity 
-Avid Unity ISIS iSS2000 Integrated Switch Blade with 8 1Gb Ethernet Ports 
-1 10Gb Ethernet Port, and 1 Expansion Port (open market item)

Additional 2TB ISIS Chassis

-Avid Unity ISIS Storage Chassis. 32TB Capacity with 16 i2000 Storage Blades
-2 iSS 2000 Integrated Switch Blades, 3 iCP600 Power Blades and Rack-   mounting Hardware
-Avid ISIS 1M Expansion Port Cable
-MNT, Support, Unity ISIS for Each Additional Chassis 
-Service, Project Management, Daily Rate (open market item) 
-Installation Daily Rate with Travel Expense (install ISIS 2.0 Upgrade and Perform System-Wide Bundle Upgrade)
-3 Year Maintenance
-2 Year Warranty
-Upgrade ISIS System ID# 2929271533

                                                           Part II

It is recommended that this acquisition be conducted using a combined LSJ and JOFOC pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements at FAR 8.405-6(e) and FAR 13.501(a) (ii).  Since the software licenses and hardware for the Avid/ISIS/Interplay storage and retrieval systems include some open market items as well as General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule items, a combined LSJ and JOFOC is required.  The combined justification serves to support the determination that this acquisition be conducted as a non-competitive acquisition with York Telecom Corporation, a GSA Vendor (GS-03F-0439K) for the following reasons:  

The Broadcast Center is currently under conversion to High Definition with York Telecom as the awardee of the contract.  Within this conversion, we purchased an ISIS/Interplay Storage and Access System for the AVID Non-linear Editing Suites.  
o	York is responsible not only for the installation of the original equipment but the maintenance of those units when installation is complete and commissioned.  
o	Since this is an upgrade with additional digital storage capacity, it is recommended that York be the sole source vendor for this Upgrade.  
o	York is responsible for integration of the entire system to ensure compatibility throughout all of the different components.  
o	They are also responsible for the total engineering of the Broadcast Center’s editing suites, studio, graphics units, character generators, as well as the current ISIS system.
o	It is imperative that all these units operate in a synchronized fashion in order to produce a broadcast quality product.

As the vendor holding the maintenance agreement and the Broadcast Center modifications contract, we have an established link to York Telecom for any issues that arise from their installed products.  

And since:

o	This is an upgrade to an existing system and as such, no other manufacturer will be compatible with our editing suites.

o	Avid is an industry leader in Broadcast Video and we’ve relied on this brand for approximately 15 years to date.

o	Avid is PC based which makes it totally compatible with the infrastructure at Social Security.  The only other Broadcast system is MAC based and will not be compatible with any of our existing hardware.  

o	Software that is ancillary to the Avid Editing Suites is all Windows based and no other brand would be acceptable or even usable for the Broadcast Center.

For the above reasons and because SSA has a substantial investment in York Telecom and Avid Interplay/Isis Software and hardware; it would not be feasible or economical to entertain similar products as a potential replacement.  The continuation of maintenance for York Telecom and Avid Interplay/Isis Software and Hardware is required.  
Statutory Authority:
This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of  the Multiple Award Schedule Program (40 U.S.C. 501), and in accordance with FAR 8.405 (e) for those items that are on the GSA Schedule and FAR 13.501 (a) (ii) for those items such as 
-Sixteen i2000 Storage Blades for replacing i500 Storage Blades in Existing
Engine (Requires return of 16 500GB Storage Blades) (open market item)
-Two iSS2000 Integrated Switch Blades for Converting a Single Engine
with iSS1000 Integrated Switch Blades (Requires return of 2 iSS1000
Switch Blades) (open market item)
-Two iXS2000 Integrated Switch Blades for Converting a Single Engine 
with iXS1000 Integrated Switch Blades (Requires return of 2 iXS1000
Switch Blades) (open market item)
-Avid Unity ISIS i2000 Storage Blade with 2TB Capacity (open market item) 
-Avid Unity ISIS i1000 Storage Blade with 1TB Capacity 
-Avid Unity ISIS iSS2000 Integrated Switch Blade with 8 1Gb Ethernet Ports 
-1 10Gb Ethernet Port, and 1 Expansion Port (open market item)
-Service, Project Management, Daily Rate (open market item) 

that are open market items. 

The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire the maintenance support and license upgrades from Avid Technologies and York Telecom Corporation for those software products that are on the GSA Schedule and for those products that are open market procurements.  These software and hardware components are mandatory for the execution of production products that satisfy the mission of the Social Security Administration in both internal and external communications.  

The contracting officer believes that the combined justification contains sufficient facts and rationale to justify the acquisition of software maintenance and license upgrades from York Telecom Corporation for three reasons: (1) York Telecom Corporation is the only source on GSA Schedule who can provide the maintenance support for ISIS/Interplay Storage and Retrieval systems: (2) GSA has already determined that GSA pricing from its Schedule Program is fair and reasonable, and: (3) A Notice of Intent for the open market items was published in the FedBizOpps.
