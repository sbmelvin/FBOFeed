<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, devices, and materials and perform all work required to Construct Newport Research Antenna Measurement Facility, Newport, NY.
<p>The AFRL requires construction of a new approximately 5,000 SF research antenna measurement facility and demolition of existing structures. The nature of work will require coordination of several construction elements including new concrete and structural steel work, earthworks, demolition, HAZMAT abatement, paving, and typical commercial and institutional facility construction. Installation and construction of a standalone fire protection system, including water reservoir, freeze protection, and pump, will be required.</p>
<p>The new building will consist of an elevated antenna bay structure, an attached single-story research laboratory facility, and a concrete foundation for a large antenna silo/tower structure. The superstructure of the elevated antenna bay will be a combination of structural steel and reinforced concrete. The research laboratory facility will consist of research and test labs and meeting space. The superstructure of the antenna silo will consist of fabricated structural members and plate steel. However, only the construction of the silo foundation is within scope of the project. Supply and erection of the tower is NOT in scope. Site improvements will include site storm drainage, a new access road to the site that also connects with the existing northerly access road, and asphalt parking areas. Decommissioning and demolition of the existing structures is required once the proposed new facility is constructed and online. Work is expected to be performed in phases sequentially. The new structure will be constructed while the existing remain in operation.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a Total Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.15. The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with an associated small business size standard of $36,500,000 average annual revenue.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.<br /><br />The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be posted online at the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov under the reference number FA875118B0003 on or about 31 JUL 2017. Bids will be due approximately 30 days later. A site visit will be conducted about 10 days after issuance of the IFB. The date will be finalized when the IFB is posted.</p>
<p>The IFB documents will only be available electronically. Potential bidders will be responsible for downloading the IFB documents and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and any additional information.</p>
<p>Award will be a firm fixed price (FFP) contract resulting from a competitive IFB. Competing bidder's bids shall be ranked according to price. Award will be made to the lowest priced responsible bidder, whose bid is responsive to the terms of the IFB. Bids will be accepted on an all or none basis only. Partial bids will not be accepted. Successful bidders will be selected based upon the lowest total evaluated price (TEP).</p>
<p>Interested vendors may register their contact information at the Federal Business Opportunities website under this notice. The list will be available online and is to facilitate subcontracting and teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to receive a contract award, if issued, the successful bidder must be actively registered in and have their Online Representations and Certifications completed in the System for Acquisition Management (SAM)- www.SAM.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals for the development and deployment of automated tools to assign Confidence Scores (CSs) to different kinds of Social and Behavioral Science (SBS) research results and claims. CSs are quantitative measures that should enable someone to understand the degree to which a particular claim or result is likely to be reproducible and/or replicable.  These tools will assign explainable CSs with a reliability that is equal to, or better than, the best current human expert methods, and will enable a consumer of SBS research to quickly calibrate the level of confidence in the Reproducibility and Replicability (R&R) of a given SBS result or claim.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

<SUBJECT>Draft SSERVI CAN Released for Community Comment
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDA013J
<RESPDATE>070318
<CONTACT>Dr. Sarah Noble , Email HQ-SSERVI@mail.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) have released a Draft version of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) as NNH18ZDA013J for community comment.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The text of NNH18ZDA013J is a draft of a planned future opportunity for the submission of multi-institutional team-based proposals for research as participating members of the <strong>Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute</strong>. Proposals must clearly articulate an innovative research program addressing basic and/or applied research fundamental to understanding the nature of the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and the near space environments of these bodies, to enable eventual human exploration of these destinations. Although the Institute will continue to support research addressing all of these potential human exploration destinations, in light of the administration's focus on returning to the Moon, as well as the near-term opportunities that will be provided by the burgeoning commercial lunar industry, proposals which address these near-term lunar needs and opportunities will be given preference. Proposed research that complements current CAN-2 Institute Teams, and/or addresses important research areas not currently covered in the Institute, will be given strong consideration (see: <strong>http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams</strong>).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The research scope for this CAN is in the fields of lunar, NEA, and martian moon studies, with preference given to topics that emphasize studies related to the Moon and those that relate to joint interests of SMD and HEOMD. The proposed research should address NASA's basic (science) and applied (exploration) research goals and should include multidisciplinary investigations that address the objectives of this CAN. The proposed research should be integrated; thus, proposals consisting of tasks addressing multifaceted questions must demonstrate significant scientific and/or technical connections among the tasks. Proposals that only address a single question should strive to integrate interdisciplinary expertise and methodologies. It is expected that teams bring together expertise from more than a single institution.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This CAN will support the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon studies encompassing investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, genesis, evolution, and the near-space environments of these bodies. Investigations that link science and exploration are highly encouraged. Fundamental research having clear, critical and longer-term implications for acquiring or interpreting data regarding potential human destinations is encouraged (for example, addressing Target Body Strategic Knowledge Gaps), as are research efforts that are relevant to (but are not dependent upon) current or future space missions. Proposals in the areas of astrophysics and heliophysics that are enabled through human and robotic exploration of the Target Bodies are also solicited through this Cooperative Agreement Notice. Efforts to develop new technological approaches to scientific exploration of Target Body(s), are encouraged, including but not limited to telerobotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Supported investigations include, but are not limited to, theoretical investigations, numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes, experimental/laboratory investigations, development of technical/technological approaches, and field studies.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The full text for this draft CAN may be downloaded as PDF file from <strong>the NSPIRES page for NNH18ZDA013J</strong>, which may be reached by following the link embedded in the text or by or by searching on NNH18ZDA013J at <strong>http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/open</strong>.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Comments on the draft text are due by COB July 3, 2018, via email to<strong> HQ-SSERVI@mail.nasa.gov</strong>.</div>

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E134, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis custom whole exome sequencing from Genewiz, LLC, 115 Corporate Blvd, South Plainfield, NJ 07080-2409.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $15.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be August 1, 2018 through September 1, 2018. <br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The CCR, ROB research goal is to understand the molecular events that drive radiation therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Blood derived genomic DNA will be exome sequenced at high coverage (50-100x) (n=29). Tissue from targeted biopsies will be enriched for tumor, genomic DNA extracted, and exome sequenced at very high depth (200-300x target coverage). Somatic point mutations, insertions/deletions, and copy number alterations will be identified. (n=60). Tissue from normal tissue where available will be sequenced to serve as a "panel of normals" (required for eliminating false positives) at moderate depth (50-100x), (n=21). The ROB has conducted a preliminary feasibility study using two sets of patient samples to determine if adequate yields of tumor can be obtained from baseline biopsies for sequencing and microarray, and to optimize sequencing output for coverage needed.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The CCR, ROB research goal is to understand the molecular events that drive radiation therapy resistance in prostate cancer. The purpose of this project is to assess genetic changes found in pre-treatment prostate biopsies to determine biological predictors and factors for radiation resistance. Whole Exome Sequencing will be performed on normal and tumor biopsies acquired prior to radiation therapy.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>This will encompass custom whole exome sequencing. One hundred and ten homo (110) sapiens samples of double stranded genomic DNA will be sequenced by Illumina HiSeq configuration. The estimated output is approximately 350M raw paired-end reads per lane with a quality guarantee of &gt;80% of bases &gt; Q30. Reports will be delivered as FASTQ files.</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS/ AND PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>Generate a sequencing library for each sample. Perform exome sequencing with 5gb to 60 gb output (gb = 1 billion sequenced bases), equivalent to 50X - 200X for each sample. Sample output needed will be specified for each sample individually. <br /><br />Reports - The Government will receive regular updates including QC reports and sequencing metrics.</p>
<p>QUALITY ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Contractor Quality Requirements</p>
<p>Tests - Contractor shall use existing knowledge of acceptable libraries and sequencing output to verify that quality is maintained.</p>
<p>Supervision - This should be limited to avoid employee/employer relationships.<br />There is no potential conflict of interest on this point.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Inspection Criteria - The Government will download FASTQ files by secure FTP/GLOBUS.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria - The Government will perform sequence alignment and contamination checks to verify that the sequence reads are genuine and authentic. The Government will assess data delivery to determine that specified sequencing output (in gb) is delivered for each sample as required.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>At the Contractor's Facility.</p>
<p>REPORT(S)/DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>All deliverables will be sent to the NCI Technical Point of Contact.</p>
<p>Deliverables: Quality report, FASTQ files. The Government will receive one or more pairs of FASTQ files for each sample to be sequenced. FASTQ file pairs will contain 5-60gb of sequencing output, as indicated for each sample submitted.</p>
<p>GeneWiz is a sequencing facility with the instrumentation needed to sequence 110 samples at very high depth in the time frame needed. GeneWiz is the only known vendor to have performed a previous pilot study in collaboration with the Government that demonstrated their ability of this project. A comprehensive and robust pilot study from a previous procurement was performed in collaboration with GeneWiz on normal biopsy material to determine optimal input and sequencing requirements to achieve 100-200x coverage needed to effectively analyze genomic alterations in these samples. This pilot study is specific to GeneWiz instrumentation and selecting another Contractor would require the unfeasible task of repeating the pilot study. This is a large sequencing project with 110 different precious pre-treatment patient samples which cannot be replaced. Therefore, this requirement is for continuity of service. GeneWiz has previously performed studies with samples from this study to determine if adequate quality and quantity of DNA could be obtained for informative whole exome sequencing using their materials and hardware. The samples tested for this ongoing project are low abundance/concentration and quality is impacted from the extraction from paraffin embedded tissue. GeneWiz previously sequenced several samples that are included in this project to clarify the depth of sequencing required to provide useful data. This data will be integrated with that of additional samples included in this requirement. It is vital that the sequencing conditions be maintained between the previously sequenced samples and the samples tested through this requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 5:00 PM EST, on <br />June 26, 2018. All responses and questions can be emailed to Kimesha Leake, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at kimesha.leake@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02RC82577-24 on all correspondence.</p>

The Conventional Animal Facility (CAF) is designed to house animals that are not able to be maintained in the main building at the NIEHS, Animal Facility due to health issues. The design of the CAF does not include a cage washing facility, thus there is the requirement for compact storage and disposable/recyclable animal caging. Equipment is not allowed to enter the main facility once exposed to the Conventional Animal Facility so that there is no risk of contamination to the animals housed in the main facility. <br /><br />The Innovive ventilated racks are the only racks compatible with current disposable caging and supplies in the Animal Facility. For on-going research projects, compatibility with existing equipment is required to prevent in-house research animals from being at risk. The Innovive ventilated racks are thus required to meet the specifications for this requirement.<br /><br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334516 &ldquo;Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing&rdquo; and a Size Standard of 1000 employees. <br /><br />The anticipated delivery time is 8 Weeks, ARO. <br /><br />NIEHS will solicit and negotiate directly with Innovive, LLC, and no solicitation will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must express their interest and must be submitted in writing via email to Tanya Redfearn at shields3@niehs.nih.gov and are due by 3:00 PM, June 21, 2018. No faxed documents will be accepted. If no responsive statements are received by the due date, an award will be made to Innovive, LLC.</p>
