<CONTACT>Todd Mathie, Contracting Officer, Phone 505-842-3403, Fax 505-842-3177, Email tmathie@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Recovery – The Basic BPA call was awarded to CACI Inc Federal and their contact information is available at the FBO notice AG-9702-K-09-0001. The purpose of the proposed modification 0001 to this BPA call is to provide incremental funding in the amount of $960,000.00 and to accomplish an in-scope ceiling increase of $150,792.56. The BPA call ceiling will be increased from $1,618,415.44 to $1,769,208.00 in order to accommodate for an approximately 9 percent increase in expected support required.  Due to the unknown level of effort required to meet the contracting and grants and agreement support needs of the Economic Recovery Operations Center (EROC) located in Vallejo, CA, this requirement has been awarded and will be modified as a time and materials type contract. The labor rates are fixed price; however, the exact number of hours of support required for each labor category cannot be established in advance of the award.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Ms. Kathy Granillo-Beebe of Tempe, Arizona, for the provision of services to produce and implement a program to raise awareness in Phoenix schools of the 2010 Census.  The work will take place in and around Phoenix, Arizona.  The work will be monitored and reviewed by the U.S. Census Bureau Denver Regional Office in Denver, Colorado.  Ms. Granillo-Beebe is determined to be the only responsible source due to her unique combination of experience, capabilities, and knowledge, including having successfully performed this same task for the 2000 Census.  This is not a solicitation announcement or an invitation for bids.  Information received regarding this announcement will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Census Bureau believes it is in its best interest to award an order to Kathy Granillo-Beebe for the project to raise awareness of the 2010 Census in the Phoenix schools.  Inquiries may be addressed to Clark Terrell, Contract Specialist, NPC Procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  Program and Performance Management (PPM) Services Contract Task Order Award
THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. A Task Order was issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of competitively award Contract DE-FE0004002 Modification 006.  The work to be achieved under this task order shall be performed using funds obligated under this contract, appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 1115 (Recovery Act).  
Task Order TSK41816.300.03 entitled American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)  Technology Program Support was issued to Leonardo Technologies, Incorporated of Bannock, Ohio.  (DUNS:  123687142)  The work to be conducted under this task order specifically involves services to support planning, executing and assessing NETL programs for the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Strategic Center for Coal.  Leonardo Technologies shall provide technical and administrative support services for program planning, execution and assessment as well as provide general assistance supporting other program-related activities, such as communications and outreach.

The Task Order is being issued on a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee basis.
