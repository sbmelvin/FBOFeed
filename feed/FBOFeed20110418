In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332812 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.
The Government has a need to produce a set of film based reference radiographs with appropriate quality indicators from the ASTM E446 reference casting sections (ASTM E446 - Standard Reference Radiographs for Steel Castings Up to 2 in. [51 mm] in Thickness.  The film based reference radiographs will then be digitized to a 10 micron resolution, checked for reproduction quality, and then organized into a database compatible to current digital radiographic standards and identical in appearance to the film based standard.  The digital reference images will be reviewed both by the ASTM E07.02 subcommittee and the ASTM E07.93 subcommittee to ensure fidelity to the original film standard.  An associated document detailing the scope and use of this new digital standard will be written.  Both the digital reference images and the associated document will be voted on and passed thru both the ASTM E07.02 subcommittee and E07 full committee.
AUTHORITY: This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government; but this notice of intent, is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 2 May 2011 16:00 Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 16 May 2011.

HEMI has the unique capabilities to bond these large and unique material structures to the critical level of quality required.  These unique capabilities allow HEMI to prepare and conduct the bonding operation correctly and this is extremely important because there is only one 105mm tube and refractory liner available.

<DESC>The U.S Army Contracting Command, Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. 07806-5000, onbehalf of Product Manager,  Crew Served Weapons intends to award a sole source modification to FN Manufacturing LLC. 797 Old Clemson Road, Columbia SC 29229-4203 to fabricate and deliver 3,053 M240L Machine Guns to the U.S. Army on a fixed price (FFP) basis under a contract modification to W15QKN-09-C-0108 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B). The overall contract effort will be for the fabrication, inspection, testing and delivery of 3,053 Machine Guns. 
This sole source modification of the M240L MG is critical to the Army in order to continue production and fielding of the M240L MG until the new limited competitive contract deliveries are available under the upcoming solicitation number W15QKN-11-R-F004. Failure to deliver weapons would result in an unacceptable break in fielding.
The M240L Medium Machine Gun (MMG) is to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped in accordance with the Government TDP and tested in accordance with the M240L Weapon Specification.  The M240L Machine Gun (MG) is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed 7.62mm weapon that fires North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standard ammunition from an open bolt position.  It features a folding bipod, quick change barrel assembly with integral carrying handle gas system, feed cover, bolt assembly (which allows closing of the cover regardless of bolt position), collapsible butt stock, integral optical sight rail, and forward rails. The M240L MG is fired utilizing either the attached bipod or by mounting the machine gun on the current M122A1 or M192 light weight tripod. The distinguishing lightweight features of the M240L MG are a titanium receiver, redesigned barrel assembly with recontoured outer dimensions, titanium carrying handle, and lighter weight gas housing; and pistol grip/trigger frame assembly composed of a metal/polymer hybrid.  
This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.
The POC for this action is Sergio Moraga, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army Contracting Command  Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000, Email: sergio.moraga@us.army.mil.

Project Description: The proposed project is to rehabilitate two existing circa 1940's buildings (approximately 10,000 square foot each) in accordance with "The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings."   The project would include both design and construction activities, and would be solicited under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.3 "Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures."  The buildings shall be designed and built to achieve at minimum a "Silver" rating in accordance with U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The type of space in the buildings would include training (educational-type occupancy), conferencing (assembly-type occupancy), high density storage (storage-type occupancy), and office (business-type occupancy).  The existing buildings are located at the Bureau of Reclamation's Date Street Complex in Boulder City, Clark County, Nevada.
A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $5M - $7 M.
This requirement will be solicited using full and open competition.  There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures, FAR Part 15, and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about May 30, 2011, under Solicitation number R11PS30147.  Only the (3) three highest qualified offerors selected after the evaluation of the Phase I proposals will be invited to participate in Phase 2 of the solicitation.  Stipens will be offered to the 2 unsucessful offerors who participate in Phase 2.

There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to Sigma Aldrich P.O. 14508 St. Louis, MO, 63178 for carbon-13 stable isotope internal standards: trans- 9-octadecenoic acid-1, 2, 3, 7, 8-13C%, trans -11-cotadecenoic acid -1, 2, 3, 9, 10-13C5, trans, trans-9,12-octadecadecadienoic acid-14, 15, 16, 17, 18-13C5 and trans -9-hexadecenoic acid-1, 2, 3, 7, 8, -13C5.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325998, All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is for Sigma Aldrich to provide the analysis of trans fatty acids in human plasma. The C13 stable isotope internal standards will increase selectivity and sensitivity of the compounds to be measured in NHANES population samples. <br /><br />Sigma Aldrich is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because they are the only certified source able to synthesize the C13 stable isotopes needed within the required time (less than four months) and with specified purity. The manufacturing of such compounds is a very complicated process which requires a highly skilled synthetic chemist to make these compounds.
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Sigma Aldrich. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gjf3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-93166 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN March 1, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Initially, 600 MC will be delivered f.o.b. destination directly into an Army Aerostat located in Elizabeth City, NC . The helium must be delivered over a 36-hour period in an uninterrupted supply chain until the aerostat is filled. Once filling begins, deliveries cannot be interrupted until all 600 MC have been delivered and the aerostat is fully inflated. The remaining 600 MC will be delivered f.o.b. origin into Government-Provided bulk helium conveyances. The peroid of performance is 01 July through 31 October 2011. &ensp;<br />The helium for this procurement must be supplied by a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) authorized federal helium supplier, or more specifically, a commercial supplier who has an in-kind crude helium sales contract with BLM, to the extent that supplies are available. In effect, this will result in an other than full and open competitive environment for this procurement under FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.<br />The Contracting Officer plans to issue the Request for Proposal (RFP) no later than April 22, 2011.</p>

<CONTACT>Patrick Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 7323237754, Email patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Integrated Systems Solutions Inc, 22685 Three Notch Rd, California, MD 20619 for technical support services for the procurement of information technology, management anaylsis, and flight operations scheduling support services for the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) in the support it provides to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Test Pilot School (TPS). The Government intends to procure the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be three months from date of award.
<p>The Test Pilot School is a unique organization and requires contractor personnel to perform management and flight scheduling support with the knowledge of the intricacies of the school's operation to ensure all aspects of the flight and academic curriculum can be met on schedule to meet graduation requirements of its ongoing classes. Integrated Systems Solutions, Inc. is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to extend the contract and increase the level of effort. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would be detrimental to the Test Pilot Program. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the Test Pilot School is both operational and financial. Flight operations to train pilots for scheduled RDT&amp;E testing of the Navy Airship MZ-3A will be disrupted delaying capability to provide test pilots for this important program to the Navy to test improved communications systems that allow no interruptions between personnel and mobile stations. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the testing because a restart after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered.</p>
<p>This increase is being processed soley for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive SEAPORT-e package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the SEAPORT-e Task Order is in place. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Responses should reference N68335-10-C-0386. The Point of Contact is: Mr. Patrick Smith, email: patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil; phone: 732-323-7754.</p>

<a href="mailto:fuller.elizabeth@epa.gov">ELIZABETH E. FULLER</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Superfund Remediation Technology and Innovation (OSRTI) Analytical Services Branch (ASB) has a requirement for Multi-Level, Multi-Matrix Organic Sample Analyses. This requirement will provide a contractual framework for qualified laboratories to apply EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for determining the presence and concentration of specified organic sample analytes. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380 with a U.S. Small Business Administration defined size standard of $12 million. This acquisition will be partially set-aside for small business concerns.
This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply EPA CLP analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 52 volatile, 67 semivolatile, 21 pesticide, and 9 Aroclor target compounds in water and soil/sediment samples. Analyses are performed using Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and Gas Chromatograph/Electron Capture Detector (GC/ECD). The EPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods to meet the EPA's anticipated analytical needs using the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. 
Detailed information on the analytical requirements is provided via the Organic (SOM01.2) SOW and its associated exhibits/appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/som1.htm). The SOM01.2 SOW is a protocol that will define the organic methods and procedures accepted by the CLP.
The EPA has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts of interest (COI).  It is imperative that the organic CLP contractors be beyond reproach and free from any improper influence or bias, as the potential for conflict could dramatically erode public confidence in EPA?s ability to accomplish its mission of protecting human health and the environment.
As a result, an offeror who is a SMO (Sample Management Office), ESAT (Environmental Services Assistance Team), or QATS (Quality Assurance and Technical Support) contractor at the time of CLP contract award will be ineligible for award of a CLP contract.  An offeror that has a significant financial interest in or business relationship with a SMO, ESAT and/or QATS contractor which cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated by time of award will also be ineligible for award of a CLP contract.  
The following provisions and clauses will be included in the solicitation and resulting contract(s) to avoid COI and awarding a CLP contract to an ineligible offeror:
A. Solicitation Stage
	To mitigate significant potential for COI the following provisions will appear in the CLP solicitation.
Section K - ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-72) (APR 1984)
  Section L- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-70) (APR 1984)
Section L- CONFLICT OF INTERST PLAN (LOCAL LC-09-04) (DEC 2001)
Section L- DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Section M- EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS FOR AVOIDING OR MITIGATING AN EXISTING SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The solicitation will require the offeror to identify any financial interests in or business relationships with the Sample Management Office (SMO) contractor, the Quality Assurance Technical Services (QATS) contractor or and Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) contractor. If the EPA determines that financial interest or a business relationship with such a contractor creates an actual or significant potential conflict of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided, neutralized,or mitigated, the offeror will be ineligible for award. Furthermore, an offeror that currently has a SMO, QATS, or ESAT contract at the time of contract award will be ineligible for CLP contract award. 
Section M - EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN (LOCAL LRT-09-05) (DEC 2001) DEVIATION
 The plan described in Section L.14 entitled "CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" will be evaluated as acceptable or not acceptable.  Notwithstanding any other evaluation of the offeror's proposal, an offeror that submits a plan that is unacceptable at the time of award will not be eligible for a contract award.
Solicitation Attachment (to be determined) - MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTORS? CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS
B.  Contract Management Stage
The contract will require the contractor to certify annually that no conflicts or potential conflicts of interest exist, or that they have been disclosed or mitigated.  In addition, the contractor must certify that all personnel who are to perform work under a task order have been informed of their obligation to report any personal or organizational COI, and that the contractor understands its continuing obligation to search for and to report any COI.  The solicitation and resultant contract will also contain the following COI contract clauses.  
Section H- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (EPAAR 1552.209-71) (MAY 1994)
Section H- NOTIFICATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST REGARDING PERSONNEL (EPAAR 1552.209-73) (MAY 1994)
Section H- LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT)  (EPAAR 1552.209-74) (OCT 2005) ALTERNATE V (APR 2004)
Section H ? ANNUAL CERTIFICATION (EPAAR 1552.209-75) (MAY 1994)  Section H ? PROJECT EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (EPAAR 1552.227-76) (MAY 1994) (End of Provisions and Clauses)
During the contract period of performance, the contractor will be required to continue monitoring for potential or actual COI. The contractor is required to report any COI that may arise, as it is made aware of the issue. This includes both at the organizational level and the personal, employee level. In addition to reporting the COI as they arise, the contractor is required to submit an annual certification to the Contracting Officer, stating that the contractor has disclosed all potential or actual COI and that employees have been informed of their obligation to report COI to the contractor.
Furthermore, any CLP contractor will be restricted during the life of the CLP contract, absent advance written approval by the cognizant contracting officer, from entering into a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contract, from entering into a contract with a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contractor, or from having a significant financial interest in or business relationship with a SMO, ESAT, or QATS contractor. 
Offerors will be evaluated on factors which include Past Performance, Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Sample, Contract Compliance Screening Audit, Quality Assurance Plan, Key Personnel and Pre-Award Onsite Laboratory Audit. Offerors will be required to request Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Samples from the Contracting Officer by the date specified in the solicitation. In an effort to streamline the procurement process and to utilize electronic communication to the maximum extent possible, the solicitation, amendments, and other related items for this procurement will be posted at this website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod. Solicitation PR-HQ-09-12542 will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about October 29, 2009.
Interested parties are required to download the RFP and all related documents from the aforementioned website and to monitor it regularly for status updates.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a requirement for an online Patient Health Risk Assessment (HRA) Integrated with VHA's Electronic Medical Record and Personal Health Record.  VHA is seeking a patient self-administered HRA application integrated with VHA's Personal Health Record and Electronic Medical Record.  HRAs are instruments that collect information from individuals through the use of structured questionnaires. HRAs determine risk status via validated algorithms or decision rules and provide tailored feedback to the individual about his or her health status, with specific recommended steps to improve health. Core features of an HRA include assessment of personal information, past medical and surgical history, medications, family history, health behaviors (use of tobacco, alcohol, diet, physical activity, etc.), and receipt of preventive care (screenings and immunizations, etc.). Elements also desirable include information on self- management for common chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, health risks relevant to the elderly, and readiness-to-change for health behaviors that increase patient risk for disease and/or injury. The VHA is also interested in assessing issues relevant to combat Veterans, such as military-related exposures, trauma, or sequelae related to military experience.

The LAP requires highly specialized facilities, equipment, and tooling for the safe storage, handling, transportation, weighing, consolidation and testing of high explosives and fuzes.  In most cases the production processes dealing with high explosives and fuzes must be performed remotely.  The facilities must be specially designed and fabricated to meet DOD hazard/safety standoff requirements in order to mitigate the risk of propagation in the event of an unintended initiation of explosive materials.  Additionally the LAP personnel must be specially trained to work with explosives.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic and x-ray test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.

<DESC>This SIR/RFP is being posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management Policy, Section 3.2.1.3.12, Public Announcements. The FAA requires the capability to retrieve National Airspace System (NAS) flight plan information and distribute essential flight plan information to all air traffic control and traffic management facilities.  The FDIO system distributes NAS flight plan data, weather information, and general information to associated Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCT), Radar Approach Control (RAPCON), and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) remote sites.  The FDIO system also allows flight plan data to be input to the NAS from the remote sites.  The FDIO System is comprised of the FDIO Gateway (FDIO-G) equipment at the 22 ARTCC and the Personal Computer-Remote Control Unit (PC-RCU) equipment and associated peripherals located at FAA and DoD FDIO remote sites.
The FAA has a requirement to technically refresh the Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) Personal Computer- Remote Control Unit (PC-RCU) inventory currently in use throughout the National Airspace System (NAS).  The PCRCU routes flight plan information to Replacement Flight Strip Printer (RFSP), Replacement Alphanumeric Keyboard (RANK), and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or display elements through serial channels. There are 539 FAA controlled facilities that have fully operational Flight Data Input Output systems.  
The FAA intends to technically refresh a minimum of 630 PC-RCUs with options for an additional 2400.

<SUBJECT>STUDY OF CHURNING IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP)

<RESPDATE>042811

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.
<p>The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) in the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is planning a new study on the causes and costs of churning in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as Food Stamps). SNAP is the primary nutrition program in the United States. States administer the program. The benefit is funded through federal dollars; states share the administrative costs equally with the federal government. In FY2010, SNAP had a budget of $68.3 billion and served an average of 40 million participants per month. <br />The study will examine churning in SNAP. Churning is when SNAP participants leave the program despite remaining eligible and return within a very short period of time, defined here as four months or less. The issue is of concern because of the hypothesized relationship between churning and additional costs to the program and participants. SNAP staff must collect paperwork and complete the application process for families whose eligibility probably has not changed since they left the program. Participants lose benefits, limiting their access to nutritious foods and must spend time reapplying for SNAP. Thus, this study seeks to better understand churning - particularly, how often churning occurs, why, and how much it costs.<br />The objectives of the study are fourfold; to examine: <br />1.the prevalence of churning, by determining the rate of churning in the program; <br />2.why families churn, including individual, policy, and program factors; <br />3.various stakeholder views of churning; and <br />4.how churning affects program costs, including if churning costs more than continuous enrollment.</p>
<p>The study will be a mixed-methods study, using extant administrative data from selected states, policy analysis of state SNAP policies, and new data collected through interviews and site visits to selected SNAP offices. The anticipated data sources are:<br />&bull;Administrative Data. States track enrollments by head-of-household. The case file also includes all members in the SNAP unit, defined as all the people who purchase and prepare meals together. The contractor will be responsible for collecting and preparing the data from the states for analysis, with guidance from ORA. Because collecting data from all 50 states would be cost prohibitive, the contractor and ORA will together determine the appropriate number of states, likely six to eight states. <br />&bull;Policy Analysis. The contractor will gather data on state policies from the State Options Report and the contractor's own research to examine SNAP policies' relationship to churning. All policy options should be under consideration.<br />&bull;Interviews. The contractor will interview people in each of four groups on their perspectives on churning - 10 program administrators, 30 case workers, 30 participants who have experienced churning, and 20 directors or other representatives of community-based organizations. The semi-structured interviews will ask for respondents' perspectives on churning, including whether or not it is an issue, how frequently it occurs, why it occurs, and what could be done to reduce it. <br />&bull;Site visits. The contractor will visit SNAP sites in conjunction with the interviews to gather data on the causes and cost of churning, modeled on a process-evaluation-style of data collection. The contractor will observe the sites and interview program administrators and case managers about the process of churner re-entry, including the steps involved, what churning-specific policies, if any, are in place, and how the process differs between sites. The contractor may examine some case files to determine the reasons a participant that has churned did so. Upon award, ORA and the contractor will determine the best number of sites to visit, likely six offices in different states.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: AACT CORP., Marriottville, MD 21104-1018.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br><br>RESPONSES WILL BE RECEIVED FOR FUTURE REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATION ONLY.<br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The fabrics are required for test and evaluation in the ballistics area to determine potential of material for ballistic protective applications. The fiber will be analyzed from a research standpoint to understand the fundamental performance of the material. This is new technology which needs to be studied and analyzed more fully for ballistic applications. There are no other suppliers of this material than the one listed.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>The source provided is the only known US source of this material, especially the fiber requested. It is the requestor's understanding that the source has the exclusive rights to this material in the US.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>A market research was not completed as we were made aware of this material through other government agencies as well as from the supplier.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>It is important that this material be assessed for ballistic protection. No other source can provide the materials requested. It is the requestor's understanding that only this source can provide the fiber requested and since the source is the US supplier of this material, the Government would expect to get the best price. It is conceivable that another company could buy the fabric from the supplier and resell to the Government; mostly likely at a higher price. However, this is the only supplier for the fiber in the US.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>At the present time there is only one producer of this material, which is in Russia. Subsequent acquisitions are expected to be sole source as well for small quantities. If this material is successful and is put into an end item for fielding, it is anticipated that a number of body armor manufacturers may use the material, which would open up competition (but still only one US supplier for the raw materials). This material has not been sufficiently vetted to warrant attempts at finding US fiber manufacturers who might be willing to produce the fiber technology.<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on April 23, 2011.<br><br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-6180<br>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<br><br>

<RESPDATE>050911
<CONTACT>Jeanine Hubler, Director of Contracts and Grants, Email jhubler@oceanleadership.org
<DESC>Announcement of Opportunity<br />(RFP) 1410-00006<br />Request for Proposals for providing Water Velocity Profile Instruments and 3D Single Point Current Meter Instruments on Fixed Platforms
<p><br />The Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "Ocean Leadership"), with funding from the National Science Foundation, is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing instruments and related services to support the objective of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). This RFP solicits two classes of instruments: Instruments for measuring profiles of water velocity (referred to as ADCP instruments), and Instruments for measuring water velocity at a single point along three axes with the purpose of continuously determining point geospatial water velocities (referred to as VEL3D instruments). The OOI will construct a networked infrastructure of oceanic sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. The measurements of water velocity are vital to our understanding of many of the crucial scientific questions to which the OOI can provide answers.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is seeking firms who are interested in submitting proposals for the ADCP and /or VEL3D Instruments. The selected firm(s) will provide approximately 86 ADCP instruments across 12 different series and approximately 27 VEL3D instruments across 4 different series for deployment on fixed platforms at OOI arrays.</p>
<p>For the ADCP instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for all twelve instrument series, or two separate awards: one for the seven series of instruments that support profiling ranges of less than 500 meters, and one for the five series of instruments that support profiling ranges greater than or equal to 500 meters. For the VEL3D instruments, Ocean Leadership intends to issue a single award for all four series of instruments. Ocean Leadership will not make more than one award for any one series of Instrument.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is the only point of contact for this procurement.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors who intend to submit a proposal should plan on participating in an online informational Bidders' Conference (via WebEx) to be held on April 21, 2011. The purpose of this Bidders' Conference is to provide an overview of the OOI program and design; the roles of the existing Implementing Organizations; and the high-level requirements of this RFP. Prospective bidders are encouraged to participate but must inform the Ocean Leadership Director of Contracts and Grants of their intent to attend by e-mailing their request to RFP1410-00006@oceanleadership.org by 1:00 PM EDT (10 AM PDT) April 20, 2011.

<DESC>The James H. Quillen VA Medical Center in Mountain Home, TN intends to award a sole source contract to Double R Construction to provide design and construction services renovate approximately 2,000 square feet of existing space on the first and second floors of Building 162.  The renovation will convert a portion of the existing space into a common space for residents and provide nurses' workstations throughout each wing.  Related space functions will be constructed in accordance with VA Design and Space Planning Criteria and VA Master Specifications.  Work includes but is not limited to the demolition of existing nursing stations, soffits, walls and doors, floor finishes, wall finishes, suspended acoustical ceiling systems, electrical, lighting, data and communications systems; modification to existing mechanical HVAC ductwork, electrical, lighting, plumbing, fire protection sprinkler and alarm systems, data and communication systems construction of new walls, doors, floor finishes, wall finishes, suspended acoustical ceiling systems, mechanical HVAC ductwork, electrical, lighting, fire protection sprinkler and alarm systems, data and communications systems; additional miscellaneous improvements and modifications as required to provide a complete and functional common space for residents and nursing work areas within existing space.

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)-Other than Full and Open Competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-2.  This Special Notice is NOT a request for competitive quotes, as the urgency of completing this work is eminent as "Time is of the Essence", and the project work presents a unique requirement of challenges in the project area, which calls for a level of infection control that exceeds current standards.  A delay in award could result in serious injury to the medical center.
 NAICS code 236220 is applicable to this solicitation and the business size standard is $33.5M.
The VA anticipates this requirement will be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS AS THIS WORK IS ISSUED AGAINST AN EXISTING AGENCY CONTRACT.</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Modification 9 is to obligate $2,100,000 in initial funding in support of Work Assignment 0-200 and new Work Assignment WA 0-201. The period of performance for Work Assignment 0-200 will be from March 3, 2011 through December 31, 2011. The period of performance for Work Assignment 0-201 is anticipated to be from April 15, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Work Assignment 0-200 is funded at $450,000 and Work Assignment 0-201 is funded at $2,000,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of Work Assignment 0-200 of Contract EP-C-11-009 is to conduct up to seven regional Tribal Small Water System Technical Training Workshops. The goal is to provide training to as many of the employees of tribes and territories as possible that received American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding for wastewater and drinking water projects. There are 96 wastewater projects and 64 drinking water projects on Tribal lands. Five projects are in the US Territories. It is estimated that up to 50 attendees will join us at each of the seven workshops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the workshops will focus on how best to operate, troubleshoot and maintain small wastewater and drinking water systems. The workshops will also include a module for tribal leaders on effective utility management. One of the most significant challenges with small, rural wastewater systems is the inability or lack of knowledge by their operators to maintain them. Providing technical assistance to Tribal Governments and US Territories can be particularly challenging due to highly remote geographic locations. In addition, many of these communities lack access to technology for webcasts and even basic internet access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Work Assignment will provide up to seven technical training sessions that are geographically reasonable for these ARRA funded Tribes and Territories to travel to. The Indian Health Service (IHS) will fund travel, hotel, and per diem costs for the attendees. The potential workshop training locations may include: Anchorage, Billings, Rapid City, Seattle, Albuquerque, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment is also to provide ways to increase information sharing and improve collaboration between EPA Regions and headquarters and IHS working on Clean Water Indian Set Aside (CWISA) projects using ARRA funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor support staff identified for these activities must have knowledge of the subject matter, experience developing training tools and techniques, professional tribal work experiences, and knowledge of different learning styles and tribal culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of Work Assignment 0-200 of Contract EP-C-11-009 is to provide support to EPA in the management and oversight of ARRA funds provided to the SRF assistance recipients. Management/oversight of the SRF ARRA funds will consist of assisting EPA in the review/inspection of State SRF assistance recipients to ensure proper use of ARRA funds and compliance with ARRA requirements. EPA estimates that 500 inspections will be conducted under Work Assignment 0-201.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

This announcement with the attached Standard Form 1449 constitutes the only solicitation for which proposals are being requested.  <br><br>There is a need to procure a Cobalt 60 Source Replacement for use by White Sands Missile Range.  A full detailed description of Specifications for the Cobalt is listed in the attached document "STATEMENT OF WORK".  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror having the BEST VALUE for the Government and conforms to the solicitation requirements.  Proposals must include all requested items in order to be considered for this procurement. <br><br>Best Value Determination<br><br>In determining which proposals are deemed to offer the best value, the Government will evaluate the quality and acceptability, strengths and weaknesses of the technical proposals, past performance, and the relative value of the cost proposals with due consideration.  <br><br>(1).	Technical Acceptability--Each proposal will be evaluated to determine if the proposal Meets, Exceed, or Does Not Meet all of the technical requirements as defined and specified in the description.  Technical Capacity is significantly more important than Past Performance.  While the Price will be an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Price evaluation factors (technical and past performance) are significantly more important than the Price factor. However, Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluations for non-Price factors become more equal.<br><br>(2).	Past Performance--Assessments will be based on all available Performance data relative to all Cobalt 60 Source Replacement projects, public and private, for the last 4 years to include cost, schedule adherence, and quality of product data to determine if the offeror has previously successfully provided systems that are similar in scope and capability to the system specified in this description.  The Offeror's past performance information shall also include a point of contact person's name, business name, business address, phone number, email address, and contract number and date for which items were provided.<br><br>(3).	Price--The government will evaluate each offeror's pricing proposal to confirm that the offeror's proposed firm-fixed price for the performance of the SOW identified in the technical volume of the offeror's proposal does not exceed the maximum possible award price.  The contracting officer shall consider the reasonableness of the offeror's proposed price by reviewing the pricing data submitted by the offeror in response to the solicitation and comparing such pricing data against the offeror's technical proposal.<br><br>The applicable NAICS code is 325188 with at size standard of 1000.  Payment will be made by the Defense Financial and Accounting System (DFAS); therefore, vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (http://www.ccr.gov/), as well as, Wide Area Work Flow (https://wawf.eb.mil/).<br><br>Vendors shall submit product descriptive literature to validate a complete technical review demonstrating that all of the capabilities listed on the Requirement Specifications are met. Proposals that do not include sufficient technical information will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered further for award. Sufficient is determined by meeting all and every aspect of the description.<br><br>Proposal information and commercial literature shall be submitted electronically to brett.t.moore@us.army.mil no later than 2:00 pm MST 19 May 2011.  Proposals shall include all charges that will be invoiced for (i.e. shipping/freight), Company Tax Identification Number, CAGE Code, DUNS number, and estimated number of days to deliver after date of contract award.  Price proposals must be valid for 90 days from the date of submission. Oral offers will not be accepted. <br><br><br>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to identify an Adjunct Faculty to provide a course on the subject of Policy in a Constitutional System for the Federal Executive Institute.</p>
<p>The government executive operates in a policy environment in which various levels and branches of government as well as non-governmental entities play critical roles. Executives must have an understanding of the policy process, the interests and approaches of the various stakeholders, and mechanisms for translating policy into program. Using these tools, executives must be able to successfully develop and implement policy within our constitutional framework.</p>
<p>Scope of Work <br /><br />It is imperative that our policy makers have specialized expertise in public sector skills including a thorough understanding of working within the political environment. This includes focusing on developing the ability to think and act in complex situations across organizational boundaries using competencies such as political savvy, strategic thinking, and external awareness. Through case studies, the instructor will enable the participants to develop a working understanding of the constitutional framework that policy makers work within as well as skills to map the landscape of decision-making, identifying key actors and influences to public policy issues, and the ability to formulate strategies to respond to strategic management dilemmas. It is preferred that this instructor has extensive experience as a facilitator and public speaker utilizing the Socratic method to promote senior public executive political management and public leadership skills within a constitutional setting. The instructor will also focus on historical references chosen for universal themes and relevance to the practicing public executive. <br /><br />The instructor will be expected to do the following: <br />1. Prepare or cause to be prepared a set of pre-course readings that will be distributed by FEI to the government executives before presentation of the course; and<br />2. Prepare all course materials and associated handouts, all of which the vendor must assert that the vendor has legal right to.</p>
<p><br />Dates and Location</p>
<p>Courses will be conducted at the Federal Executive Institute - Dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>May 2 - 4, 2011<br />July 12 - 14, 2011<br />August 15 - 17, 2011<br />August 29 - 31, 2011</p>
<p><br />Proposal Submission Evaluation and Award</p>
<p>Proposals submitted under this Solicitation will be evaluated, and contractor(s) selected, based on both technical and cost considerations. Please provide cost proposal information separately from the technical proposal. The contractor(s) shall provide a fixed-price for the contract that includes delivery fee, training material and travel related expenses. Proposals not containing a total cost will be rejected as non-responsive. An offer that does not meet all of the solicitation requirements may be rejected as non-responsive.</p>
<p>The technical proposal should include details describing contractor's ability to provide the service requirements listed above. The Federal Executive Institute reserves the right to conduct an interview.</p>
<p>Service providers may be required to present a short section of a course and/or demonstrate their presentation and communication skills prior to receiving a contract. Course presentations are from 30 to 45 minutes and should provide a clear summary of the offeror's communication and teaching style and methods.</p>
<p>A complete proposal package is required for full consideration by FEI. A complete proposal package includes:<br />&bull; A resume<br />&bull; A biographical summary <br />&bull; Additional narrative descriptions as indicated under proposal submission requirements.</p>
<p><br />The Federal Executive Institute will select the contractor(s) whose offer provides the best value to the government, in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items, considering primarily technical factors and secondarily price. The award may be made with or without discussions with the offeror(s). Therefore, your offer should include your lowest pricing.</p>
<p>The Federal Executive Institute is a tax exempt entity; please do not include taxes in proposal.</p>
<p>Instruction for Preparing the Pricing Portion of the Proposal</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a Firm-Fixed Price proposal</p>

<p>Government agencies have differing levels of security clearance requirements. The Contractor may be required to obtain or provide evidence of appropriate clearances for personnel who will work on task orders before the work begins. Clearance requirements are often but not always stated in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) accompanying an invitation to a Task Order Competition.</p>
<p>(b) Reference clause 1752.209-70 of this contract -</p>
<p>The Contractor need not be capable of performing all the tasks described in a SOO in order to be eligible for a task order award. However, having the capability of performing all described tasks generally enhances the Contractor's likelihood of receiving a task order award.</p>
<p>(c) Reference clause 1752.209-71 of this contract -</p>
<p>The Contractor is required, as stated in Section C.6.a of the contract, to provide a designated Vendor Management Point of Contact (POC).

<p>(d) Reference clause 1752.209-71 of this contract -</p>
<p>For all task order awards, substitute personnel qualifications must be equal to or greater than those of the personnel being substituted or must otherwise be acceptable to the customer and approved in advance by the Vendor Management COR. If a Vendor Management COR determines that the proposed substitute personnel are unacceptable, or that the reduction of effort would be so substantial as to impair the success of the project, the Contractor may be subject to termination for default action under FAR 49.4. All substitute personnel must be oriented and or trained for project performance at the Contractor's expense.</p>
<p>(e) Reference clause 1752.209-71 of this contract -</p>
<p>For all task order awards, in the event that the performance of the Contractor is determined to be unsatisfactory at any time during the task order, Vendor Management reserves the right to terminate for default under FAR 49.4 existing task orders and to replace the Contractor if remedial actions are unsuccessful or are deemed insufficient to address legitimate customer concerns.</p>
<p>(f) Reference clause 1752.209-72 of this contract -</p>
<p>The policy and the specific requirements of a Vendor Management customer will determine whether some or all of the Contractor's employees working on a task order must be citizens of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.</p>
<p>(g) Reference clause 1752.209-73 of this contract -</p>
<p>Contractor personnel shall not solicit new business outside their Vendor Management contract or task orders from a customer for whom the Contractor is performing work under any Vendor Management task order. The Contractor must coordinate marketing efforts with Vendor Management project managers with respect to all new and continuing task orders with that customer.</p>
<p>(h) Reference clause 1752.224-70 of this contract -</p>
<p>The Applicability section in the referenced clause section applies to Vendor Management contractor personnel performing on task orders specifically for an FEI internal customer.</p>

<p>1752.224-70 Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)</p>
<p>(a) Applicability</p>
<p>This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific FEI requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.</p>
<p>(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic.</p>
<p>(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII</p>
<p>(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor.</p>
<p>(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be:<br />&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.<br />&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.<br />&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.<br />&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted. Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment. Do not send PII in the content of an email.</p>
<p>(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p>
<p>(1) FEI has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the FEI network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment. FEI employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip. Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.FEI.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments. It is available on all FEI workstations attached to the agency's network.</p>
<p>(2) A password protected file is not secure. Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.</p>
<p>(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII</p>
<p>(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic. As an agency, FEI is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information. In order to meet this responsibility, FEI has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure.</p>
<p>(2) FEI contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the FEI Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk - regardless of the time or day of the week. Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. FEI's IT security experts will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The FEI Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the FEI Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) Points of Contact</p>
<p>(1) FEI contractors must report a breach or potential breach of PII to the FEI Situation Room at:</p>
<p>sitroom@FEI.gov<br />(202) 418-0111 <br />Fax (202) 606-0624</p>
<p>(2) When notifying the Situation Room, please copy or copy the Contracting Officer at:</p>

<p>1752.224-71 Freedom of Information Act Requests (Sep 2009)</p>
<p>(a) Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore:</p>
<p>(1) All items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked in all documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (FEI or The Government). Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the FEI determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA. However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.</p>
<p>(2) No later than five (5) business days after award of a contract, blanket purchase agreement (BPA), or order, the Contractor must provide FEI a redacted copy of the contract/BPA/order in electronic format. This copy will be used to satisfy any requests for copies of the contract/BPA/order under the FOIA. If the Contracting Officer believes that any redacted information does not require protection from public release, the issue will be resolved in accordance with paragraph 3.104-4(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>(b) Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and must ensure that all work performed by its subcontractors shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's responsible employees.</p>
<p>(d) Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors to whom any Government record may be made available or disclosed must be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 19 U.S.C. 641. That section provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to their use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisoned up to ten years, or both.</p>
<p>1752.228-70 Insurance (July 2005)</p>
<p>(a) In accordance with FAR 52.228-5, "Insurance-Work on a Government Installation (JAN 1997)" incorporated by reference, the Contractor must secure, pay the premiums for and keep in force until the expiration of this contract, and any renewal thereof, adequate insurance of the types and in the amounts as specified under FAR 28.3.</p>
<p>(b) Each policy of insurance must contain an endorsement that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government's interest must not be effective unless the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice of cancellation or change, as required by the CO. When the coverage is provided by self-insurance, the Contractor shall not change or decrease the coverage without the CO's prior approval.<br />(c) A certificate of each policy of insurance must be furnished to the CO within ten (10) days after notice of award certifying, among other things, that the policy contains the aforementioned endorsement. The insurance company providing the above insurance must be satisfactory to the Government. Notices of policy changes shall be furnished to the CO. The substance of this clause must be made to flow down to any subcontractors.</p>

<p>(a) Contract line item(s) * through * are incrementally funded. For these item(s), the sum of $ * of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).</p>
<p>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."</p>
<p>(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."</p>
<p>(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."</p>
<p>(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</p>
<p>(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p>On execution of contract $ ________<br />(month) (day), (year) $ ________<br />(month) (day), (year) $ ________<br />(month) (day), (year) $ ________</p>

The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM â€“ STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerorâ€™s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System â€“ Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplierâ€™s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplierâ€™s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplierâ€™s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplierâ€™s percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606 Washington, D. C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTE:  Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to respond to any negative comments received during past performance evaluation except for those already addressed by the contractor (i.e. response to contract discrepancy notices, cure notices, show cause notices, etc).  An offeror showing no relevant past performance relating to this request for proposal will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably, but will receive an unknown risk rating.<br><br> 	4.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>See Addendum Below<br><br> (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br>(End of provision)<br><br>ADDENDUM TO FAR Clause 52.212-2.  The following addendum is included and hereby made part of FAR Clause 52.212-2.<br><br>(a)  Basis for Award<br><br>     1.  The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical factors stated in this RFP.  Failure to propose a price for all CLINs will render the proposal unacceptable and the proposal will be rejected.<br><br>     2.  Evaluation factors upon which award will be based, are set forth below.<br><br>(b)  Evaluation Approach<br><br>     1.  The Government will evaluate each proposal by employing the lowest price technically acceptable method.  The written proposal, in conjunction with the on-site evaluation, will be used to assess evaluation factor ratings.<br><br>     2.  All proposals will be subjected to an initial screening by the Contracting Officer to determine whether proposals are complete before being evaluated as detailed below.  Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.  Offerors are advised that unsupported promises to comply with contractual requirements will not be sufficient.  Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>     3.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306 and final offers will be evaluated in the same manner and against the same criteria as were initial offers.<br><br>(c)  Evaluation Factors for Award.  Proposals submitted in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following factors:  Price, Past performance, and Mission Capability.  The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors are equal in importance and when combined are less important than the Price factor.  <br><br>1.  Mission Capability.

804.1102	VERIFICATION OF STATUS OF APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR (OCT 2010) (DEVIATION)
 
(a)	The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at: www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:
 
(1)	The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service- disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov, internet site. This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.
 
(2)	Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3). Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and
 
(3)	Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4). Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day-to-day management and administration of business operations. Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day-to-day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.
 
(b)	CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO. The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.
 
(c)	If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.
 
(d)	This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contract the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 372-3949</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager will support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities. OTI currently has four regional teams: Asia and Middle East (AME), Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). It is anticipated that the Senior Program Manager will provide initial assistance to DCHA/OTI's Asia and Middle East (AME) team or Afghanistan team&nbsp;in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, DCHA/OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>The Senior Program Manager will be based in Washington, D.C. as a member of one of DCHA/OTI's regional program teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD). Regional teams are responsible for all program-related activity in the region. The incumbent will report to and be supervised by one of the FPD Regional Team Leaders (initially the AME Team Leader). The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Support of implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for up to 3 months if required;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD), Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch (ACIB), 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, has a requirement for a modified version of a cough aerosol stimulator which is capable of reproducing the spread of infectious aerosol particles in a room after a simulated human cough.</p>
<p>This requirement is solicited as unrestricted.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13. (Depending on availability of funds).</p>
<p>From 2007 through 2010, NIOSH and West Virginia University collaborated on a project to design, construct and test a custom&#8208;built cough aerosol simulation system. The cough aerosol simulator uses a piston and cylinder driven by a computer&#8208;controlled linear motor to reproduce the flow pattern associated with a human cough, and a nebulizer, drier and mixer to generate and condition the test aerosol. The system is controlled by a computer running custom&#8208;written software. The system simulates a patient with an infectious respiratory disease such as influenza who is coughing and expelling potentially infectious particles into the air.</p>
<p>Current cough aerosol simulation system. <br />During an experiment, the cylinder is loaded with a test aerosol containing an infectious<br />respiratory virus such as influenza. The linear motor then pushes the piston upwards, which<br />"coughs" the test aerosol into the experimental test chamber.</p>
<p>After extensive testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the system, one important limitation has become apparent. As currently designed, the cough produced by the system is at or slightly below room temperature. However, actual human coughs are closer to body temperature. Because of this, the plume from a human cough is buoyant relative to the ambient environment and tends to rise. Computer modeling by WVU has shown that this buoyant plume could potentially carry aerosol particles further than seen during room&#8208;temperature coughs, which means that infectious particles could spread more widely throughout a room.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now necessary to construct a second cough aerosol simulation system identical to the first custom&#8208;built system, except modified to produce coughs at body temperature. The new system needs to be otherwise identical to the current one so that the systems are interchangeable and can use the same software for controlling the system, interfacing with other equipment, and collecting data, and so that results can be directly compared. After construction, experiments and CFD simulations will need to be performed to verify that the new system is capable of producing body temperature coughs and to compare the dispersion of coughs at room and body temperature.</p>
<p>The new system should have the following characteristics:<br />1) The system should be able to reproduce the air flow and volume profile of prerecorded human coughs.<br />2) Simulated coughs should contain a high concentration of aerosol particles (108 particles/liter of air exiting mouth) with a size distribution comparable to those produced by human coughs when exiting the mouth.<br />3) The cough outlet should be 60" from the ground and have a 0.8" inner diameter.<br />4) The temperature of the simulated coughs should be consistent and controllable from room<br />temperature (20&deg;C) to body temperature (37&deg;C).<br />5) The major components of the new system (cough cylinder, linear motor and amplifier, computer interface cards, control valves, etc.) should be as identical as possible to the existing system so that the performance of the two systems are identical.<br />6) The system should be compatible with the existing cough aerosol system control, interface and data collection software and hardware.<br />7) The floor footprint of the new system should be the same as the existing system.<br />8) The system should not release more heat into the environment than the existing system.<br />9) The system should not have external fans or other devices that will generate air flow within the test chamber.<br />10) The system should be capable of continuous operation in an environment with a temperature of 4&deg;C to 33&deg;C with relative humidities of 10% to 90% (non&#8208;condensing).<br />11) Nondestructive biological decontamination of system components exposed to infectious material must be possible.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: This work should be completed within one year of awarding of the contract.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post replies to questions submitted regarding this RFI. It is requested that any further questions are submitted no later than Friday, April 22, 2011. Please see file "SPICE_RFI_QA". 

1. The Government is issuing this announcement as part of a market survey for a long endurance, ship-based, offboard vehicle capable of carrying an active Electronic Warfare (EW) payload for use in next generation coordinated Onboard/Offboard EW countermeasures missions. 

2. To achieve EW mission effectiveness the vehicle must be compatible with ship operations in the maritime environment up to and including sea state five conditions. Innovative technologies are required that minimize the shipboard operational and logistics footprint concerning storage, refueling, maintenance, safety, and launch and recovery operations.
 It is envisioned that ship systems will provide initial positioning, velocity, and vehicle direction information. The system should be capable of autonomous operation and have communications capability for minimal interaction with the launch/control platform to receive mission updates and report health and location status. Concepts for this vehicle system must be realized while minimizing manning requirements during shipboard operation. Technologies that utilize shipboard available energy sources are essential and use of existing command and control links on U.S. Navy ships is preferred. Liquid fuel based systems must comply with DoD Directive 4140.25 regarding fuel standardization. Potential vehicle solutions may include but are not limited to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).
 Expendable systems concepts will be considered if they can be shown to provide total cost of ownership benefits.

3. The vehicle must be able to carry a nominal 35 lb. payload (minimum 25 lb. to maximum 50 lb.), provide 1KW of payload prime power and accommodate placement of a transmit and receive antenna pair with an unobstructed 90 degree field of regard, integrated with the vehicle platform to achieve maximum transmit to receive isolation. The vehicle must be capable of steering the vehicle/antenna pair over a 360 degree azimuth in winds from any direction. Each vehicle must be able to achieve and maintain station keeping relative to shipâ€™s position for a minimum of 2 hours duration, with longer duration preferred.
 The systems concept must show command & control capability for operating 3 platforms simultaneously from a single control station and conducting sorties to achieve continuous station keeping for a mission length of 24 hours, with minimum impact to shipboard storage, operations, and required manpower. For the purposes of this RFI, assume the system is stored, deployed, and operated from a single ship, and a single control and handling crew will be utilized to support the entire mission. 

4. This market survey will support an Analysis of Alternatives where vehicle analysis will take into account physical characteristics, operational effectiveness, suitability, logistical characteristics, and life-cycle cost to assess particular vehiclesâ€™ potential abilities to successfully execute the mission.
 Conclusions drawn from the AoA will form a portion of the basis for a Milestone B decision, currently planned for FY13. Funding for this effort is expected to be available in FY12 with a low rate initial production planned for FY18.

5. The government is seeking interested parties that may have developed or would be capable of developing potential vehicle solutions for this analysis that have one of the following attributes:

a. Vehicle/system performance that can meet stated requirements with either little or moderate adaptation, upgrade, modification, or development from an existing demonstrated and tested system. Technology risks associated with the vehicle have been sufficiently reduced such that the system can achieve a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 at Milestone B.
 TRL 6 is achieved when system/subsystem models or prototypes have been demonstrated for this program in a relevant marine environment (Source: Defense Acquisition Guidebook)

b. Innovative solutions that have not fully matured but that can be shown to be expected to meet the requirements in the allotted timeframe. 

6. White paper responses to this RFI may be up to the SECRET level and may not exceed twenty (20) pages. Interested sources possessing the capacity to deliver a vehicle system meeting the conditions outlined above are requested to respond. Any information that the responder considers to be proprietary should be clearly marked. The government will protect such information in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
 White paper responses should include the following items:

a. General concept description or approach to meet the aforementioned requirements and attributes.
b. System description to include, but not limited to:
i. General vehicle/system description;
ii. Vehicle operating characteristics (dash, cruise, & loiter speed, and system endurance referencing specific associated parameters); 
iii. Vehicle dimensions, size, weight; 
iv. Propulsion system description including fuel/energy source;
v. Payload size and weight capacity, and power available;
vi. Command/control/communications systems concept description for multi-vehicle operation and dynamic retasking considering maximum use of existing shipâ€™s system;
vii.
 Storage, launch, and recovery equipment, footprint, and procedures description;
viii. Vehicle quantities, manpower and logistics to achieve mission; 
ix. Ship compatibility and compatibility with marine environment;
x. Cost information;
xi. Current vehicle/system uses;
xii. Technology Readiness Level information.
c. Performance requirements compliance matrix, using the format provided in the RFI attachment, to document the proposed systemâ€™s ability to meet outlined requirements. Identify which capabilities have been demonstrated.
d. Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the program and respective risk mitigation approaches.
e. Identify performance requirements or functionality that would require adaptation, upgrade, modification or development.
f.
 If necessary, provide a spiral development process that will result in a fully compliant vehicle in the desired timeframe.
g. Any additional information to support claims that the system performance will meet the capabilities contained in this announcement.

7. White paper responses are due May 13, 2011. If the response if classified, submit two (2) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy on compact disc to Erica Bowling at the following address:

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)
1333 Isaac Hull Ave., SE
Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040
Attn: Erica Bowling 02532B

If the response is unclassified, it may be submitted via email at erica.l.bowling@navy.mil. 

8. The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses.
 Please note that the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions. The Government may ultimately develop and issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) However, the Government is under no obligation to issue an RFP.
