<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS


The General Services Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Real-Time Research (RTR) which operates out of West Kingston, Rhode Island.  
This procurement is focused on providing support to SPAWAR Systems Center for the Program Composition for Embedded Systems  (PCES) DARPA program.  This task will include system engineering and analysis to support PCES program, the Coalition Forces International program, and the Common Object Framework program.  The contractor shall provide personnel to conduct research, develop algorithms using formal methods, provide recommendations and develop adaptive & reflective negotiation capability to support the PCES program, the Coalition Forces International program and the Common Object Framework program. Specific tasks within this task order include extending standard CORBA middleware with capabilities that are designed to support embedded real-time system programming, developing specific Patterns as standard programming abstractions for real-time embedded programming practices such as scheduling and binding, and extending the standard software development practices based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to include support for real-time embedded systems. This  significant undertaking requires a thorough understanding of distributed real-time scheduling algorithms including the Distributed Affected Set Priority Ceiling protocol and distributed load shedding algorithms and analysis weighted with quality of service parameters; formal patterns for real-time embedded systems, and real-time middleware.  Key to providing needed support to PCES is a detailed understanding of these and other real-time scheduling algorithms and their implementation in dynamic middleware and associated real-time analysis tools. The experience required to fulfill the functions of this task include the following: (1) Demonstrated previous development of Real-Time CORBA Scheduling Services for Department of Defense applications.  (2) Demonstrated previous development of Real-Time CORBA Binding Services for Department of Defense applications.  (3) Experience working with the DARPA Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Open Experimental Platform (4) Demonstrable experience in Patterns for Real-Time Systems that must include at a minimum papers published in recognized Real-Time Patterns development meetings.  (5) Participation in the Real-Time CORBA standardization process that must include significant past attendance at the Object Management Group?s (OMG) Real-Time Working group. The current task is complex and has immediate, direct implications on PCES?s ability to meet its stated goal of providing software techniques for embedded systems by developing necessary distributed real-time scheduling functionality and demonstrating it in the UAV OEP and in published Real-Time Patterns.  RTR has technical expertise and familiarity with the tasks being addressed by PCES including extensive original design and prototyping of Real-Time CORBA scheduling and binding services, an installation of BBN?s UAV OEP software (including source code), and staff that have presented at Real-Time Patterns workshops and have participated in the OMG?s Real-Time CORBA standardization efforts. Real-Time Research is a recognized research leader in the areas of Real-time, Middleware, Modeling, Databases, and Real-Time Collaborative tools.  RTR has had several contracts from SPAWAR Systems Center in the above research areas as well as having personnel from and a working relationship with the University of Rhode Island?s Computer Science Department?s Distributed Real-Time Research Lab, another recognized world leader in real-time embedded systems research.  Further, RTR has had key roles in the technology assessment, recommendations, real-time middleware for the Virginia Class Attack Submarine Combat System for the past seven years.  The RTR project will leverage the expertise of SPAWAR Systems Center, the University of Rhode Island, and Real-Time Research to produce programming abstractions, tools, and middleware components that reduce the effort required to develop real-time embedded-system software. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes but responses received before May 3, 2002 will be evaluated. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurment

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Corpedia Education, of Phoenix, AZ for the completion of the following project: 

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has requested that the ATF Federal Firearms Regulation Reference Guide (FFRRG) be available on the ATF Internet sight as an interactive training tool to Federal Firearm Licensees.  This on line training will provide FFL?s the assistance they need in order to comply with the laws governing the manufacture, importation and distribution of firearms.  The training guide will consist of 3 sections, a resource center which will restate sections of the FFRRG in plain English as well as provide the exact regulation to the viewer, a help section which will post frequently asked questions, points of contact and other information deemed necessary and lastly a series of story-based, animated information scenarios that will explain common situations and important day-to-day FFL operations.  

This electronic interactive presentation was originally designed and developed for the Remington Arms Company, Inc. by Corpedia Education in conjunction with ATF subject matter experts. Corpedia Inc. has completed over 30% of the development work to include product conception and instructional design graphics; character and scene design animation; and construction and assembly of the ?Online Learning Center.?  Re-competing this entire requirement will result in serious time delays and unnecessary additional expenditures of Government funds.  Furthermore, Corpedia has extensive knowledge and experience in the application of firearms regulations to implement and finish this online product.

There is no solicitation available for this project.

<DESC>NA Solicitation DTRA01-PRDA-02-AL01.  DTRA Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) for Technology Applications. This PRDA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No other formal request for proposal/solicitation will be issued for t his requirement-request for such proposal/solicitation will be disregarded. NOTICE:Due to size restrictions, the entire content of the PRDA will be posted in two parts. The second part will follow as a a synopsis amendment to DTRA01-PRDA-02-ALO1. INTRODUCT ION: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) invites proposals for research to support technology applications under the Program Research and Development Announcement DTRA01-PRDA-02-ALO1. The administering DTRA program is the Technology Applications Div ision (TDA), Technology Development Directorate (TD). PROGRAM AREAS-Research is being sought in  three  topic areas: 1)TOPIC AREA 1:Radionuclide Detectors; 2)TOPIC AREA 2:Chemical and Biological Agent Detection; 3)TOPIC AREA 3:Nuclear Weapon Effects.  The total estimated awards(including base and potential options) inclusive of all 3 topic areas in this PRDA are estimated at approximately $53.3M.OBJECTIVES: The objectives for each topic area contained in this PRDA are as follows:OBJECTIVE 1 (Applicable to T opic Area 1): Research in radionuclide detectors. Better radionuclide detectors in terms of performance equal to existing systems with greater portability, and superior performance in terms of collection efficiency and resolution, are sought. OBJECTIVE 2: (Applicable to Topic Area 2) Research in Chemical and Biological Agent Detection. Research in detection, identification, characterization and monitoring of chemical and biological agents in clinical and environmental samples. Technical areas include health  surveillance, advanced diagnostics, environmental monitoring and nondestructive evaluation. Supporting technical efforts include software and algorithm development for data collection, management, mining and fusion. OBJECTIVE 3:(Applicable to Topic Area 3 ) Research into the effects of nuclear weapons in areas of current interest, application to DoD, and as applicable to DTRA's Center for Nuclear Weapon Effects.  Such research will involve advanced scientific computing as applied to state-of-the-art physics -based computer modeling, with verification by simulators. Each of the  three topic areas are specifically described below.  Individual proposals should be directed to only one topic area.  All topic areas are of equal importance. Topic Area 1: Radionuclid e Detectors-The period of performance will be for a base period of  up to 2 years with a maximum 1 year option period. The maximum period of performance will be 3 years including the base period and any options.  Proposals of $650,000 or less are anticipat ed for the base period with 3-5 awards anticipated for this area. 1.1-Improved Gamma Ray Spectroscopy SystemsThe focus of research in this area will be alternative gamma ray detection systems capable of offering resolutions and collection efficiency close  to High Purity Germanium (HPGe) but without the burden of extreme cooling (Liquid Nitrogen). Research should encompass new materials designed to replace HPGe in detector systems that offer high resolution and collection efficiency, but do not require elec tromechanical or liquid nitrogen cooling.  Alternatively, cooling methods for HPGe could be identified to maintain the resolution of HPGe, but improve the portability of the detection system.  Alternative systems must be reliable, provide minimal electroni c noise to the detection system, and cost competitive with liquid nitrogen HPGe detection systems. Improved electronics and software are needed to reduce noise and improve sensitivity in gamma ray detection systems.  Innovative ways of reducing the size of  the radionuclide detection systems are desired. 1.2-Improved Neutron Detection Systems  The focus of research in this area will be on improved neutron detecti on systems capable of offering better collection efficiency than standard Helium-3 tubes. New materials are desired to replace Helium-3 in detector systems that offer higher collection efficiency and better ruggedness for portability applications.Alternati ve methods for collecting neutron interaction within a detector that allow the detector to determine energy of the neutron and direction of travel are required. Topic 2:  Chemical and Biological Agent Detection-The period of performance for this area shall  be a  base period  of up to 2 years with a  maximum 1 year option period.  The maximum period of performance will be 3 years including the base period and any options. Proposals are anticipated to be  under$10M for the base period with 5-10 awards  antici pated for this area. 2.1 Software Development-Prototype software is desired to collect, analyze, and distribute information to WMD decision-makers from the local to the national levels.  Software should include algorithms for mining and fusion of multisour ce data in a variety of formats and content.  Specific applications might include public health monitoring, plant (crops and native vegetation) and animal (livestock and wildlife) disease tracking, food (field-to-table), water quality (potable water distri bution systems and surface water sources) and related systems that can detect anomalous exposure to a biological or chemical agent. 2.2 Health Surveillance-Methods and procedures are needed for tracking epidemiological data from humans, animal (livestock a nd wildlife) and plants (crops and native vegetation) that may indicate exposure to chemical or biological agents.  Data should be obtained either directly from primary sources (e.g., clinical procedures and analytical testing) or acquired through data min ing of existing computerized databases  (e.g. absentee rates, pharmacy dispensing trends).   The methods should be validated. 2.3-Development and Validation of Advanced Diagnostics. Research is needed on micro-array technologies to explore new and innovati ve ways to detect bacteria, virus and toxins in clinical and environmental samples.  Microarray technologies are also required to track host response to infection.  Advanced, high-capacity, multiplexed real-time PCR assays are desired using microarrays for  spatial separation or novel dyes for spectral discrimination.  Protein arrays are needed for proteomic assays.  Both nucleic acids and protein microarrays should be analyzed using commercial or developmental readers. 2.4-Nondestructive Evaluation. Techniq ues are desired to interrogate and identify chemical and biological materials in canisters, shipping containers and hold baggage.  New approaches need to be developed to increase instrument standoff and allow interrogation of moving vehicles or containers.   Instruments should be compatible with operations at access control points (e.g., airports, weigh stations, ports, border crossings, etc.)  Techniques should be validated. 2.5-Environmental Monitoring. Point and standoff detection devices for chemical and  biological agents are desired.  Emphasis shall be placed on low-cost, low-maintenance systems that can achieve high specificity, high sensitivity and low false alarm rate.  Ideally, instruments should be self-contained (reagents and materials easily repla ceable), automated (perform analyses onboard), and can be unattended for extended periods of performance.  Instruments should be deployable in buildings, subway systems, stadiums or the environment.  Validation of devices is desired. Topic 3:Nuclear weapon  effects. The period of performance for this area will be a base period of up to a 2-years with a maximum 1-year option period. The maximum period of performance will be 3 years including the base period and any options.  Proposals under $200K are encourag ed for the base period.  It is anticipated that one or two awards will be made from this area. Current interest involves such traditional effects as blast, seis mic, shock, thermal radiation, penetrating radiation, fallout, and electromagnetic pulse, but the Cold War scenarios are of little current application.  Today's military planners need information on lower-yield nuclear weapons, and ineffective weapons that  are targeted and delivered by less sophisticated means than during the Cold War.  Scenarios today involve infrastructure vulnerabilities like urban environments, with the associated complex geometry that greatly complicate blast, shock, thermal, etc. prop agation and impact.  Furthering the advance of understanding of high-altitude nuclear weapon effects is important in today's military planning.  Likewise, novel applications/exploitation of nuclear weapon effects in scenarios involving countering terrorist  and emerging threat countries' activities are of interest.  Such efforts are anticipated to be complex, involving establishing basic physics and applications that are state of the art, to be meshed with capabilities for advanced scientific computing, and verified by simulator experiments.  As such, these studies will require complex validation and verification processes involving different teams and differing approaches.  Successful proposers will recognize the value of coordinating efforts with diverse te ams from the DoD contractor industry and the DOE National Labs, and anticipate close cooperation, with possible need for re-vectoring of technical direction.  The potential is great for being mentored in these research areas under the tutelage of seasoned specialists from other teams, while making advances in research being pursued, and especially for identifying promising avenues of research, with attendant need for justifying new thrust directions. 3.1-Topics of interest common to academia and DoD that re late to nuclear weapon effects include such large scale natural phenomena as volcanic activity, large-scale earthquakes and meteoric impact, and sunspot phenomena that relate to high-altitude effects.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service in Albany, Ca. has a requirement for a software package 
 for analysis of 2D gel electrophoresis images. It is designed for the high throughput analysis of 2D gel image.  It automates the traditional time intensive processes of spot identification and editing, matches a
series of gel images, and evaluates differential expression data. We plan to use this software to gain insight into the differential expression of proteins in wheat endosperm under different experimental conditions.  It is also the base platform for several bioinformatics programs that associate 2D gel image analysis data with mass spectrometer identification data, perform advanced data mining, and correlate proteomics data with micro array expression data.   The USDA owns the first generation of bioinfomatics platform, Phoretix 2D database, with which progenesis is completely compatible.  The USDA intends on negotiating with the only known source for this software, Nonlinear USA Co. Durham, NC.     Solicitations are not available for this procurement and interested firms are encouraged to submit proposals by fax or mail as indicated in this notice.  See number note 22.*****

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to extend the MSFC Aircraft operations and maintenance contract with The Bionetics Corporation on a sole source basis. The contract provides services for the operation and maintenance of the MSFC aircraft.  The contractor furnishes the necessary management, personnel, equipment, and materials (not otherwise provided by the Government) to fulfill this requirement.  Safe efficient operations and maintenance of the MSFC aircraft, as well as timely support to users, are key factors in the work under this contract.  The work can be broken down into the following elements: Operations in accordance with NASA and federal standards (to include the provision of federally-qualified flight crews) and Maintenance (compliant with all applicable federal standards for the aircraft being maintained). The contract completion date is September 30, 2002, and the service will be continued up to one year through September 30, 2003.  This extension will be pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U. S. C. 2304 (c) (1) for the acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reason at this time: NASA Headquarters provided MSFC with a different aircraft (Gulfstream II) to use as a mission-management aircraft on September 10, 2001.  MFSC's previous aircraft was a Gulfstream I. Given this change, the Center Operations Directorate and Aviation Safety Officer will require approximately eight to ten months to become fully knowledgeable with all aspects of the new aircraft. However, the technical personnel charged with the recompetition effort will take action to become fully familiar with the numerous differences between the Gulfstream I and II in order to successfully formulate a plan and documentation to solicit full and open competition for the follow-on requirement.     Written responses must be received in this office within 15 days after publication of this notice.  No award will be based on any offer or proposal received in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:        http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>SUBJECT--NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE  ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS


DESC: The General Services Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Tri-Pacific Software, Inc., Alameda, California. This procurement is focused on providing support of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems  (PCES) and will include system analysis and documentation to support the Virginia Class Attack Submarine program and the Coalition Forces lnteroperability program.  The contractor shall define an adaptive and reflective real-time Quality of Service (QoS) scheduling analysis which supports real-time middleware, system scheduling policies, best fit, scalability and evolvability.  The interface is to support adaptive middleware and be portable among various platforms.  The approach selected must support the current and future real-time open architecture with minimum impact on the overall design.  Specific tasks within this task order include schedulability analysis for GME2000 models and schedulability analysis for CORBA components.  This significant undertaking requires a thorough understanding of the Tri-Pacific Rapid suite of tools, real-time systems, real-time CORBA, interfacing real-time analysis tools with high level design tools, real-time CORBA components and existing projects at SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego. Key to providing needed support to PCES is a detailed understanding of the GME2000 tools, real-time CORBA and real-time CORBA components and the interfacing of real-time analysis tools to high level design tools such as GME2000. The experience required to fulfill the functions of this task include the following: (1) interfacing real-time analysis tools with high level design tools; (2) expert knowledge of real-time analysis and scheduling issues for distributed systems (3) expert knowledge of real-time CORBA (4) intimate knowledge of Tri-Pacific?s RapidRMA tool set; (5) expert knowledge of the CORBA Component Model; (6) knowledge of the GME2000 tool set (7) experience with the Real-time CORBA Scheduling Service RapidSched; and (8) capability to do End-to-End Analysis on a Tasking Model. The current task is complex and has immediate, direct implications on PCES?s ability to meet the need for schedulability analysis in the GME2000 tool set and for analyzing Real-Time CORBA components for schedulability.  A detailed report of how schedulability analysis will be added to the GME2000 tools as well as how schedulability analysis will be added for CCMs will need to be produced no later then 30 days from contract award. Also the delivery of the tool environment, which includes RapidRMA, RapidSched and the GME2000 tools, needs to be made no later then 45 days from contract award. This contract action is subject to the availability of funds. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes but responses received before May 3, 2002 will be evaluated. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for a Full and Open competition. This Request for Proposal (RFP) will ONLY be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizops.gov. Accordingly, No telephone, fax or email requests will be accepted. Since the RFP will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website for any amendments. The Estimated release date of the RFP is mid May 2002 and proposals will be due an estimated 30 days after RFP release date.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is anticipating awarding one contract to obtain computer-based guidelines for optimizing job-specific paving concrete.  These guidelines should provide not only information, but also an interactive, systematic approach or approaches to guide end-users through the various phases of the optimization process. The guidelines shall be practical, useful and applicable to the range of concrete pavement and climatic conditions in the United States. The effort is limited to concrete for pavements, including slipform paving mixtures for Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP) and Continuously Reinforce Concrete Pavement (CRCP) and overlays (bonded and unbonded).  Patching and repair mixtures employing conventional, non-proprietary materials are within the scope of this effort. The following materials are to be considered for this effort; Portland cement, aggregates (natural, artificial, and recycled), chemical admixtures, supplementary cementitiuos materials (fly ash, slag, silica fume and metakaolin) and blended cements incorporating the previously listed cementitious materials.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Background: Mission:  NASA is developing a plan to build a Re-useable Launch Vehicle (RLV) to replace the space shuttle within the next 10 years.  The goals are to make the RLV 10 times cheaper to build and operate and 100 times safer than the existing shuttle.  All of the new vehicle's subsystems are being studied to determine safer and more economic designs.  Primary Electric Power System: Electric circuit transient power estimates for the next generation RLV range from 40 to over 200 horsepower.  Space-flight rated power systems that withstand such transients do not exist.  Distribution voltages are expected to be from 300 to 600 volts.  These high voltages will cause disruptive discharge during ascent and descent maneuvers unless special packaging concepts are developed. Power Distribution Unit (PDU): The Glenn Research Center proposes to design, build, and test a power distribution unit that will control the power delivered to large transient electrical loads.  The PDU will house current-limiting power controllers that receive command and control signals from a remote source over a digital communication network.  Each power controller will be rated for 25 amperes capacity.  Power controllers can be connected in parallel to increase the current-limiting capacity.  An external connector module will control the parallel configuration.  The PDU itself will be modular using an input module for the supply bus; a power controller cage to house five power controller modules; and a distribution module to configure the outputs of the power controllers.  These three PDU modules will control 100 amperes current at the system distribution voltage.  Additional groups of these three modules can be added to further increase the current distribution capacity.   Contractor Services Required: The contractor shall work with the NASA Glenn design team to design high-voltage distribution systems for re-useable launch vehicles.  The systems shall consist of Power Distribution Units (PDU's) and the external wiring that connects these units together.  All components shall be designed to operate together in a re-useable launch vehicle environment assumed to be the same as existing shuttle's.  Systems shall be specified for use at 270 volts per MIL STD 704E.  Services shall be for: 1.	PDU Packaging - The contractor shall specify all of the design features that preclude corona and disruptive discharge within the mechanical modules that constitute the PDU.  Nominal working voltages shall be 270volts DC per MIL-STD-704E.  Consultant shall build proof-of-concept circuits that will be used in the final PDU prototype and test them.   	Circuits shall be current limiting type capable of being paralleled to increase current limit capacity.  Individual current limiting circuits shall limit at 30 amps. 	Circuits shall use redundant series-connected voltage reducing stages to accommodate short-circuited stages. 	Consultant shall specify and implement I/O protocols for operating the circuits. Deliverables: Five proof-of-concept circuit boards. The contractor shall summarize the work performed in a written report.  The report topics shall include as a minimum:  Summary of the recommended designs and components including rationales for the recommendations. 	Calculations and supporting analyses. 	Test results Schedule: The period of performance for this effort shall not exceed 5 months from award of the order. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-06. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1.    The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 335999 and 500, respectively.  The quoter shall state in their quotation their size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to Glenn Research Center is required within 90 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Quotations for the items(s) described above are due by May 10, 2002 at 4:30 local time and may be mailed or faxed to NASA Glenn Research Center Attn: Timothy M.

<CONTACT>John  Zolper, DARPA Program Manager, MTO, Phone 0000000000, Fax 7036962206, Email none
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of complex, high performance mixed signal circuit technology with an emphasis on Indium Phosphide (InP) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) for direct digital frequency synthesis and related circuits.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  DARPA seeks highly innovative proposals that address the development of super-scaled Indium Phosphide (InP) heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBTs) technology for high speed, low power, and high transistor count (high integration) mixed signal circuits. The Phase I activity will establish InP HBTs at emitter feature sizes of 0.25 microns or below and validate the transistor performance in small scale circuit demonstrations.  Proposed efforts must address all aspects of the development from materials, device design, device processing, circuit analysis, interconnects, integration, and plans for circuit production.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 02-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  A multi-phase program is planned with awards totaling approximately $30 million for the first 24-month Phase I effort.  The Phase I effort is structured with an 18 month baseline activity with critical milestones at the end of this period, followed by a 6 month option phase. A Phase II effort, at a similar funding level, running for up to an additional 24 months is planned, but is dependent on the success of Phase I activities. The Phase II effort will have a critical decision point halfway through to assess the prospects of achieving the complete program goals. The Phase I awards are expected to be made in the late part of the third calendar quarter or early part of the fourth calendar quarter of 2002.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are very strongly encouraged to enable proposers to address all aspects of the BAA. Proposals that only address a part of the overall program scope will only be considered if they offer a critical component to the program not available within a teaming arrangement.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr John C. Zolper, fax:  (703) 741-0623, electronic mail: jzolper@darpa.mil.  Contacting the technical POC, as necessary, throughout the solicitation process for clarification is highly encouraged.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 02-19, Technology for Frequency Agile Digitally Synthesized Transmitters (TFAST), Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original hard copy of the proposal, nine (9) additional hard copies, and an electronic copy of the proposal (MS-Word readable (preferred), or PDF on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-19, proposer organization, and proposal title (short title recommended).  All proposal materials must be sent to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-19) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, June 10, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only."  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in technology for frequency agile digitally synthesized transmitters.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 02-19.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  The administrative addresses for this BAA are:  Fax:  (703) 351-8616 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 02-19), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-19@darpa.mil, Mail: DARPA/MTO, ATTN: BAA 02-19, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, the Contractor shall state, in writing, to the Contracting Officer any areas of disagreement within 5 days. 

2.  COMMENCEMENT, PERFORMANCE AND COMPLETION OF WORK

a.	The Contractor shall schedule his work as to cause the least amount of interference with Station operations.  Within 15 days after award, the contractor shall submit a general schedule of planned performance of work for the contract period to the Contracting Officer for approval.  Permission to interrupt any Station utility, communication, operational, or traffic service or pattern shall be requested in writing at least 10 working days prior to the desired date of interruption. The Contractor shall receive approval in writing from the Contracting Officer before the requested interruption may be put into effect.

During option periods the Government will adjust the prices, as required, based only on new Department of Labor Wage Rate Determinations.  

3.  SAFETY REOUIREMENTS 

In performing, the Contractor shall provide for protecting the lives and health of employees and other persons and equipment in accordance with the latest revision of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards (29 CFR 1910-OSHA), EPA Hazardous Waste Regulations (40 CFR), Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations (49 CFR), State of Florida, and local regulations.

5.  CONTRACTOR REPSONSIBILITIES

There is a greater emphasis on complying with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The contractor must comply with all applicable parts of the law, including RCRA's requirements for training and associated documentation regarding hazardous waste management. (State of Florida is now assessing penalties of up to $25.000 per each RCRA violation) Contractors are to pay any RCRA tines for which they are responsible. Contractors are required to train all of their personnel in accordance with 40 CFR Part 264.16: i.e. personnel must successfully complete a hazardous waste training program of classroom instruction or on-the-job training that teaches them to perform their duties in a way that ensures compliance with RCRA.  The language of the law is intentionally broad to allow contractors to tailor the hazardous waste training to the specific needs of their employees.  40 CFR Part 264.16 also requires contractors to formally document this training.  Contractors are cautioned that a lack of formal documentation is, in itself, a violation of RCRA and therefore the subject of fines up to $25,000 per violation.  Contractors are required to have current training documentation readily available on job site.  Formally submit a certification attesting to contractor compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 264.16 and confirm location of Contractor training records to Contracting Office.  The contractor is required to provide a copy of their Certified Training Records of all employees associated with this project.  The Government must maintain RCRA documentation for a period of 3 years following completion of contract.

<SUBJECT>B -- B: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ROMANIA CABLE SYSTEMS LAST MILE SOLUTION PILOT PROJECTS
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0170066B
<RESPDATE>053002
<ARCHDATE>06142002
<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Mr. Alexandru Oprea, General Manager, Romania Cable Systems, Sfanta Vineri 25 street bl. 105 C, Bucharest, Romania, Tel: +40 (1) 30.10.800, Fax: +40 (1) 30.10.840, Email: alexo@rdsnet.ro  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for a ?Last-Mile Solution? telecommunications pilot project with Romania Cable Systems (RCS) in Romania.

Internet penetration remains low in Romania, but continues to grow at about 5-6% per month.  With over 150 Internet Service Providers (ISPs), a domestic provider such as RCS has quickly become the largest ISP and CATV (cable television) provider with an enormous private fiber optic network in the country.  This network currently covers an area stretching between Bucharest and the western border of Hungary.  The company has approximately 800,000 subscribers.  While already a major provider of data transmission services on a national scale, RCS is currently preparing to launch fixed-line telephony service in anticipation of telecom sector liberalization in January 2003.  RCS is regarded as one of the potential key competitors within the Romanian telecommunications market after liberalization.  

Experts consider Romania?s current telephony infrastructure, owned by the incumbent monopoly Romtelecom, to be extremely poor.  Despite enormous demand, fixed-line penetration remains low - under 20%.  RCS thus believes that the availability of its network for alternative voice-services will be beneficial to the country and in line with the Government?s declared policy of improving telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate liberalization.

RCS has now proposed a series of pilot projects to determine the best connectivity option for a larger roll out to provide telephony services.  This last mile connectivity will include all cabling and equipment that runs between the company?s network backbone and the telephone receiver itself.  As part of this pilot, RCS will evaluate U.S. manufactured products from Shoreline, Nortel, Franklin, Tempest Gateway and others for the last mile connectivity to complement existing backbone equipment.  Within its existing networks, RCS already uses a substantial array of U.S. manufactured equipment from Cisco, Scientific Atlanta, Motorola, ADC (U.S. factory), Times Fiber, 3Com and others.  The three pilot projects will take place in Bucharest, Oradea and Arad.

For each of the three pilot projects, RCS will deploy certain telecommunications equipment to establish the last-mile connectivity to service residents of pre-identified apartment blocks in certain districts.  Within each of these apartment blocks, RCS has already built systems for distribution within the apartment buildings.  The selected contractor will be asked to: 1) assess the pilot technical solutions and equipment requirements, 2) procure, deliver and install pilot equipment, 3) develop specifications for follow-up procurement, 4) assess the environmental impact of these projects, 5) prepare a Final Report for submission to TDA.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $278,400 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  In addition, RCS will contribute a cost share of U.S. $30,900 to the overall project cost of $309,300.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm (EST +7) local time, May 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute, Surgery Branch intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Cellular Technology Ltd. (CTL), 10515 Carnegie Ave., Suite 501, Cleveland, OH 44106 for the purchase of a  ELISPOT Reader.   The Surgery Branch is performing research in cancer vaccines at the laboratory level and the clinical level.  In order to evaluate the efficacy of these vaccines, methods of immunologic monitoring must be employed.  ELISPOT assays allow the end-user the ability to assess the functional status of the T-cells and the ability to utilize PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) directly from patients without further in vitro stimulations which may alter the nature of these T-cells as well as the ratio of various T-cell populations.  In order to fully utilize this assay to monitor large numbers of patients enrolled in a vaccine protocols an ELISPOT reader must meet the following requirements:  1) ability to accurately visualize, detect, and count ELISPOTs of various sizes and intensities; 2) ability to store both scanned images (raw data) and analyzed data onto CD allowing re-analysis of images and sharing of images and data between separate researchers;  3) automated plate scanning as well as automated centering of wells to increase productivity time and decrease time needed to do this manually;  4) mechanism for auto-exposure/illuminator during plate scanning to eliminate technician-dependent variability and to standardize data;  5)  ability to discrimate overlapping, faint, and/or uneven spots; and  6) ability to analyze data using separate computers not attached to the actual ELISPOT reader to allow more productivity and allow multiple researchers to process data at any point in time and not have to wait for when the reader is ?free?.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 1, 2002.  All question must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  	Dipl. Ing. Bc. Ji?? Je?, State Enterprise Director, Diamo s.p., Str?? pod Ralskem, M?chova 201, PS? 471 27,Czech Republic, Phone: +420 425 851 338, Fax: +420 505 851 456, E-mail: jez@diamo.cz  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for treatment of wastewater from the Rozna mine.

Diamo is a state-owned company tasked with environmental remediation throughout the Czech Republic, particularly at former mines.  The Czech government authorized the closure of the Rozna Mine located at Dolni Rozinka by January 1, 2004.  This project includes the closure of a uranium mill at Dolni Rozinka ? a chemical processing plant for extraction of uranium from the uranite (uranium ore). 

Extraction of uranium from the ore results in the production of ?yellow cake? (uranium concentrate), which is removed from the mill, and milling wastes (suspension of leached ore and crushed ore) which is deposited as uranium mill tailings in two nearby ponds at the site. Mill tailings are separated by gravity into bottom tailings sludge and contaminated pond water on top. The two open mill tailings pond at Dolni Rozinka were designed as ?open? systems, allowing the wastes to spread to other areas.  The pond water balance at Dolni Rozinka is affected by the inflow of naturally occurring water from the pond environment and by the removal of water contained in the uranium concentrate produced at the mill.  The mill tailings ponds are sources of radioactive emissions, dust and water contamination, but cannot be remediated before removing the free water. The removal of water through the cake will stop with termination of the mill operations after the closure of the Rozna Mine. Unless the situation is addressed, there is potential for a breach of the dams or overflow of free water polluting the drinking water supply for surrounding municipalities. Water from the ponds contains, among other constituents, heavy metals with radioactive components and is, therefore, environmentally harmful. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to determine the best option for wastewater treatment and to determine the economic and technical feasibility of that treatment option.  The study will gather data including field verifications, analyze treatment options, and perform economic, financial and technical analyses.  The study will culminate with a financial and implementation plan for the selected wastewater treatment option. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $296,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, May 24, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal intends to acquire under the authority of FAR 6.302.1, Only One Responsible Source, hardware and software from National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) at the University of Mississippi. The nature of this action is the procurement of unique hardware and software solutions which have resulted from recent research dedicated to the problem of solving performance degradation of acoustic surveillance systems in realistic noise and wind conditions on the battlefield. The solutions sought are at a maturity level that they can be applied now in various acoustic surveillance systems which are in critical stages of development.   These hardware and software solutions for noise alleviation/abatement address key requirements in the Acoustic Technologies STO and Raptor System ORD.  Key to the success of integrating these noise abatement solutions is the aggressive use of world unique facilities and accompanying novel test strategies which will allow performance upgrades in a controlled test environment without requiring years of performance testing in the field, which has already proven to be an ineffective and inefficient way to find a robust solution.  A task order contract is contemplated, with a dollar ceiling of 10M and duration of 5 years.  Interested companies are requested to submit a capabilities statement by Electronic Commerce (EC) to Donna Apgar (973)724-3271 dapgar@pica.army.mil and Robert McMinn (973) 724-3504 rmcminn@pica.army.mil which should address, at a minimum, the items delineated under the note number indicated below. No solicitation will be issued as a result of this market survey. This notice is for information planning purposes only, does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. See Numbered Notes 22. 22,25,26

<CONTACT>Georgi L. Wellington, (404)562-3163 x583 Contracting Officer 4045623163583 ;
<DESC>The National Park Service is soliciting bids on a full and open competitive basis, from qualified companies, for an Archaeological Large-Scale Survey Requirements Contract at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. NAICS for this project is 541370.  Currently known cultural resources range from the Paleoindian period through the modern military occupation of the installation. This project will focus on all cultural resources older than 50 years (including military construction). Fort Bragg is responsible for various construction, training, and timber sale projects that materialize on a relatively regular basis. These projects generally vary in size (or area of potential effect) from 2 to 10,000 or more acres. Under this contract, a series of Delivery Orders will be issued for large-scale cultural resources survey projects encompassing 2500 to 10,000 acres in extent. Historic and prehistoric properties may, or may not, become affected by these projects. Indeed, in most cases it is not known if any cultural resources are present in a project area. During the course of a year, an unknown number of projects may develop from the planning stage to the construction or development stage.  The Contractor shall provide all professional staff, support staff, and specialists necessary to plan, supervise, perform, and report the required work. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, physical plant, adequate transportation for use on unpaved trails and roads, safety equipment (including cellular telephones), fuel, equipment, and material necessary to perform the services required by each Delivery Order. The Contractor shall also provide adequate professional supervision to assure the accuracy, quality, and completeness of all work required under this contract.  Since this contract requires multiple Delivery Orders, the Contractor is required to synthesize the results of previous investigations into reports and research designs for subsequent Delivery Orders. Given the possibility that multiple Delivery Orders will be issued each year, only organizations with the staff and financial resources to handle work of this magnitude in a timely fashion will be considered for this award. The Contractor must demonstrate in their proposal that they understand the requirements of this scope of work, and particularly regarding crew safety, how the location and documentation of sites and site boundaries is to proceed, report contents, local technical and historic contexts, how assemblage analysis and interpretation is to proceed, how NRHP evaluation is to proceed (including a discussion of comparative analytical procedures and the use of past work), report and graphics products, curation responsibilities, and deliverables. Technical criteria and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. This will be a negotiated firm-fixed price requirements contract. The technical proposal will be evaluated on technical evaluation criteria that will be contained in the solicitation. The solicitation will be available for download at the Electronic Commerce web site (http://ideasec.nbc.gov) on or about May 27, 2002. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued. All requests for technical clarifications or other related information MUST be in writing and may be transmitted by facsimile to Georgi Wellington, fax number 404-562-3256.

<SUBJECT>D -- Security Registration System sources sought
<SOLNBR>SS01
<RESPDATE>051602
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Nancy Lawson, Contract Specialist, null
<DESC>The Dept. of VA, Austin Automation Center is seeking sources for software to replace our current customer(user)registration/security administration software.  This software is called the Registration System or RS.   RS can be defined by its four primary features: 1) RS accepts manual input through a keyboard and formatted screen.  RS will format this information into commands that are processed by the platforms security software.  Although RS can be programmed through templates to generate practically any command, it is primarily used to generate commands for Computer Associates Top Secret security software that runs on an OS/390 platform.  Department administrators are called RS Points of Contact (POCs).  The RS POCs can create and manipulate customers (userIDs), and  assign shared access profiles without knowing Top Secret commands.  Some administrators, the RS system administrator (SA), must know the Top Secret commands in order to build the templates. 2) RS provides a limited set of the SAs administrative functionality to POCs.  RS also provides scope for the POCs and Tasks. 3) RS Tasks are what POCs use to assign permissions to a customer.  A Task is defined by a collection of information system resources or assets.  For example, a Task may provide a customer with access to Facility TSO and Data Set Name DPCPRD.TMP, Access Level READ.  This is the simplest example.  Tasks are similar to CA-Top Secret profiles, but they exist at a higher level.  POCs cannot deal with profiles directly.  POCs can only affect user ID profiles through a Task.  With RS, several Tasks can be assigned to a customer.  This creates a combination CA-Top Secret profile.  RS has a facility for constructing and modifying Tasks.  It is only available to the RS SA.  Each Task has an owner (person) who is responsible for knowing and controlling the business aspects of the Tasks contents.  RS maintains the association of the Task and Task owner. 4) RS provides reports from its IDMS database of customer information and Task information.  It can display the Tasks assigned to a customer and when they were assigned or revoked.  RS can also display the composition of a Task, that is, the facilities and data set names that comprise the Task.  This is also cross-referenced.  Statistical information is available.  RS can also display a directory of POCs. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE REPLACEMENT SYSTEM The VA/AAC would like the new RS to be the highest level of management of accessors and access groups/profiles (Tasks) among heterogeneous platforms.  We would like it to apply changes to, and reflect changes of, underlying systems with immediate results. 1. Conversion Support a. Import RS customer and Task information from its IDMS database. b. Import accessor and resource information from platforms running OS/390, UNIX or NT.  i. Must support CA-Top Secret and IBM RACF for OS/390. 2. Manage user profiles. a.  Instantly create user profiles.  i. Collect, store, display, and associate miscellaneous information about the customer (user).  ii. Have programmable means of automatically specifying a customer ID name with an optional override for top-level administrators.  iii. Create ID and assign ID to resources on any platforms needed to accomplish the job described by the Task. 1. TSO including TSO alias 2. IDMS 3. ORACLE 4. UNIX 5. NT 6. Others  iv. Generate a default password.  v. Compose and address physical notification letter. 1. Have interface to automated means of stuffing and mailing notification letter.  vi. If ID is deleted or expires, show the ID and related information in deleted status for six months. b. Allow instant modifications, inquiries, deletions, undeletions, and renaming of ID and other customer information. 3. Manage shared access groups/profiles (Tasks) with immediate results. a. Track a shared access group/profile owner (person). b. Create, modify, display, delete, undelete, shared groups/profiles.  i. One shared group/profile may bedefined by resources from various platforms or environments. c. Assign users to shared groups/profiles. d. Allow conditions (e.g. UNTIL) and extras (e.g. AUDIT) and all other similar features of current release of underlying security software. e. Graphically display/manipulate group/profile content. f. Graphically display/manipulate relationship of users and shared groups/profiles. 4. Basic Reporting - exportable to document (MS Word), Email (Outlook) or spreadsheet (MS Excel) format.  Provide search and/or filter capabilities on each available field. a. Statistical registration activity. b. Temporal registration activity.  i. When groups/profiles were added/deleted to and from which users.  ii. When and how groups/profiles themselves were changed. c. Point of Contact directory (department administrator). d. System Manager of Record directory (shared group/profile owner). e. Customer directory listed by location. f. Customer directory listed by shared group/profile membership. g. Copies of notification letters. h. Task list and composition. i. Task composition listed by resource (cross-reference of 4.h.). j. Creation, deletion, modification of users for various major business systems. 5. Programmable Reports and Queries for Auditing purposes. a. CA-Top Secret example: Combined WHOHAS and LIST command resulting in NAME extraction.   6. Have secure access, communications/connections, storage, and logging.  7. Provide various definable levels or cross-sections of administrative powers. 8. Manually entered native commands by an SA or DBA should be reflected in any graphic displays of user or resource information. It is requested that sufficient documentation be provided to allow this office to evaluate the ability of your company's product to meet the Government's requirements.  This is not a request for proposal and there is no solicitation document available at this time.  All documentation should be submitted electronically to nancy.lawson@mail.va.gov or via fax at 512-326-6028 no later than 3:30 pm CST on May 16, 2002.

<CONTACT>Jacqueline Duffy, Contract Specialist, 973-724-7660
<DESC>The U.S. Army seeks qualified sources to supply grenade (bomblet) fuzes for re-capitalization of 155mm M864 artillery projectiles.  The fuze must meet stringent reliability and safety requirements, comply with Mil Std 1316 and should include a self-destruct feature.  The SDF is for use on M42 and M46 grenades to replace the M223 Fuze.  The interface drawings for the SDF can be obtained from drawing 12967761. The fuze should be compatible with the existing grenade (drawing 9349370 typical), existing LAP processes, its mode of operation and operational environments.  The fuze must be safety certified in accordance with U.S. standards to assure safety and environmental compliance for testing at U.S. Proving Grounds.  The fuze should not exceed 18 grams maximum in a flight configuration. The fuze should allow for a delay after dispersal from the projectile to permit operation of the primary function upon target engagement. The fuze primary function mode must have a reliability of at least 97% and the combined primary and self-destruct function reliability must result in a dud rate of less than 1%.  It is desired to have the combined primary and self-destruct functions produce a non-neutralized dud rate of 0.2% or less.  A neutralized fuze is defined to be a submunition with the sensitive initiating explosive train elements in the fuze destroyed.  It is desirable to have independent primary and SD features.  Fuzing concepts may be pyrotechnic, mechanical, electronic, etc, or a combination thereof. The projected cost of the fuze should be based on high rate production (about one hundred fifty thousand fuzes per month). The complete and detailed disclosure of the SDF operational sequence with time line, physical dimensions and operational characteristics, the content of the explosive components, is a mandatory requirement for the submitted package to be considered.  The SDF must be a non-developmental item (NDI) item at the time of delivery and fully tested, if such a delivery is required.  Future procurement of production quantities of this fuze may be subjected to limitations of Section 806 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.  If so, this would require manufacture of the SDFs in North America.  All U.S. and Allied industry are requested to provide information in their own format that may be of interest to the U.S. Army in identifying potential fuze candidates.  Information may include, but not limited to: design and operational concept including any delay time for the secondary function, any test data, condition, capacity and location of manufacturing facilities, status of any development, estimated unit production costs, and the timeframe for availability of first delivery. Proprietary and/or classified information will be protected as denoted with submission. Responses (printed material, photographs, etc.) must be less than 20 pages and be delivered not later than the closing date of this notice. This information may be mailed to Jacqueline Duffy, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army TACOM ARDEC, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, AMSTA-AQ-APE  B.10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future development efforts. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted, and telephone inquires will not be honored. The U.S. Government will not reimburse the costs incurred by providing this information.

The intent of the standardization program is to establish regionally preferred sources for hospital su pply items to standardize purchasing of products for these MTFs.  Clinical Product Teams (CPT) will evaluate this product line.  Teams are composed of physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products.  They will review an d technically evaluate any samples submitted.  TriCare Region 6, 7 and 8 deems the CPT members to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable.  Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possi ble inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item requirements.  They are as follows:  1.) Standard pillow size (range between 18 to 20 inches by 24 to 27 inches) 2.) Pillow is breathable 3.) Pillow is stain resistant 4.) Pillow  is fluid resistant 5.) Pillow is hypoallergenic 6.) Pillow has anti-microbial properties 7.) Pillow can be wiped clean 8.) Pillow is flame resistant 9.) Pillow is latex free 10.) The supplier has an extended product line 11.) The supplier can provide in-s ervice training as necessary 12.) The supplier can provide and assist in a plan of conversion as needed.  This is not a Request for Proposal; the purpose of the sources sought notice is to seek commercial sources that will meet the US Government requiremen ts.  Suppliers must be Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) holders and will be required to provide clinical samples at no cost to the government.  If your company currently holds a DAPA for this Medical/Surgical Product Line, your company is eligible  to participate in the standardization process.  If your company is not a current DAPA holder for this product line, you are still eligible to participate in the standardization process for these regions by contacting the Defense Support Center-Philadelphi a  (DSCP).  Please contact the DAPA contracting officer, Mr. Lou Jennings at (215) 737-2125 for assistance.  Your company can be considered for standardization once DAPA paperwork is pending at DSCP.  Distribution of this product will be accomplished throu gh the regional prime vendor (Allegiance) consistent with the DAPA.  After you have notified the Tri-service Regional Business Office (TRBO) that your company wishes to participate, or that your DAPA application is pending with DSCP, your company will be n otified prior to the start of the standardization process for this Product Line.  If your company can provide any of these items, please forward the product descriptions and any corresponding product literature to:   TRICARE Regional Business Office, Suite 315 7800 IH 10 West, San Antonio, TX. 78230.

<DESC>A-REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF 2010 DECENNIAL CENSUS

POC Lori Donovan (301) 457-4053, Contracting Officer William H. Russell

DESC:   This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Background:  The United States Bureau of the Census (BOC) used image-based data capture technology to collect data from the paper forms filled out for the 2000 Census.  The Census Bureau would like to build upon this experience and incorporate advances in imaging technology as it plans for the 2010 Census.  As part of the planning and preparation for the 2010 Census, the BOC is seeking expertise, capabilities, and knowledge of how this data capture operation was done and how it can be enhanced.  The BOC will require: market research; technology assessment and evaluation; forms design; printing assessment; and support for intermediate testing of the 2010 Census data capture approach.  This is a follow-on initiative to research previously performed via a different mechanism.  RFI:  In support of these activities, the Bureau of the Census (BOC) is conducting a market survey to determine research capability to support Census 2010 planning.  Specifically, respondents to this RFI should submit capability statements via e-mail to Lori.M.Donovan@census.gov or mail to Lori Donovan, Bureau of the Census, 4700 Silver Hill Road, Room 2428, SFC #2, Stop 7200, Washington (Suitland) DC  20233-7200 no later than May 22, 2002.  The research activities contemplated in this RFI create an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) and preclude participation in any future contracts pertaining to certain production operations for the 2010 Census, specifically, printing of all Census questionnaire forms and the data capture of the paper forms. Responses to this RFI should address the following capabilities:  knowledge of the Census 2000 approach for paper-based data capture and for forms printing and their implementation and evaluations; ability to comply with stringent physical and IT security requirements under BOC security requirements in protection of Title 13 (T13) data [for further information on security requirements see http://www.census.gov/procur/www/contr-security, IT Security Handbook, Chapter 6]; expertise in forms design - use new digital printing technology to print sample forms for BOC evaluation of forms content and design, and evaluate new technology relating to barcodes;  expertise in printing - investigate new  variable data color printing technology for applications to targeted mailings; expertise in data capture testing and evaluation - produce non-T13 version of image snippets from Census 2000 for Vendor Evaluations and use image snippets to print digital test decks consisting of "real" handprint for use in subsequent RFPs, vendor evaluations, and system testing; expertise in Census data analysis; expertise in scanning technology - understand practical uses of color scanners for improved data capture, including gray scale/resolution trade-offs; expertise in recognition technology - perform survey of best data capture practice in business world and work with industry to learn where OCR/OMR is going in the future and select OCR/OMR Vendors for evaluation studies to determine current state of technology; provide technical infrastructure and personnel (3-5 technical experts on a full-time basis).  The contemplated period of performance is one year with four 1 year options.

<SUBJECT>--Environmental Engineering, Professional and Technical Support and Remediation Services  - Solicitation DAHA90-99-R-0001
<DESC>NA The National Guard Bureau (NGB) contemplated multiple awards from this solicitation, among them the award of a contract specifically for work at the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR).  Because of changes to the Government's requirements, an amendmen t will be made to the solicitation and the award of a contract for work specifically at MMR will not be made.  Essential continuity of operations and compliance with deadlines imposed by EPA Administrative Order(s), led to the reallocation of program funds .  This has resulted in a significant change in scope of the contemplated MMR contract. Secondly, there has been a transfer of contract responsibility to the Army Corps of Engineers, New England District.  As primary contract support agent, it will be thei r responsibility to establish contracts for all future environmental work at MMR.   Future Army Corps of Engineers procurement opportunities will be advertised in FedBizOpps and all interested parties will have an opportunity to participate in contract opp ortunities at MMR.
