<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for ABAQUS Software Lease Renewal.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the software lease from ABAQUS South, Inc. 3700 Forums Drive, Suite 101, Flower Mound, TX  75028, under FAR Part 13.106.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	(1)	 ABAQUS has proprietary copyright of the ABAQUS software.  Review of current technical literature substantiates that only ABAQUS can provide the software and associated technical support.	(2) No other software has the extensive capabilities ABAQUS has for performing highly nonlinear finite element analyses necessary to support the structural analysis of flight hardware.  (3)ABAQUS has been in use at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for eleven years.  A significant number of training hours have been invested in learning and using ABAQUS software.  This knowledge base and efficiency can not easily be transferred to another offeror’s software package. There now exists at MSFC a significant number of analytical models created in ABAQUS.	A significant amount of time and resources would be required to recreate and revalidate these models for use with any other software.  (4)Renewal of the ABAQUS software lease is necessary and urgent to support Space Shuttle Return to Flight efforts at the Marshall Space Flight Center that rely on ABAQUS as a structural analysis tool.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. (local time) on February 13, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note “B”.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Honolulu Laboratory has a requirement for a survey to remove derelict fishing gear in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Continued scientific studies of accumulation rates, densities, net types, impact on benthic habitats and several other projects are also planned.  Removal of nets for sampling, mitigation of entanglement hazards, and benthic habitat restoration are also expected to occur.  Once located and pre-removal scientific data is collected, the fishing gear will be cut free from the substrate and placed in the attendant small boat or second small boat.  The small boats will then transport the recovered debris to the charter vessel(s).   The charter vessel(s) must have the capability to transfer marine debris from the small boats, haul it aboard and then stow the recovered debris safely.  When the vessel has stowed debris to the vessel’s capacity, the debris may then be transported to either Midway Atoll or Honolulu for offloading.  After debris offloading and provisioning fuel, supplies, or personnel as necessary, the charter will immediately return to the work sites and repeat the debris cleaning/offloading cycle for the duration of the charter.  The Charter is expected to begin in Honolulu, HI on or about 25 May 2004 for a minimum contract period of three months (90 days), with two (2) 30-day options to extend the contract to a maximum of five (5) months.  Vessels shall:  be at least 90 ft. in length, able to maintain a minimum cruising speed of at least 8 nm/hr, contain fuel capacity for 90 days of continuous sea operations, able to crane-haul aboard 16,000 lbs. of marine debris, have sufficient deck space for at least 50,000 lbs. of marine debris, berthing space for an 8-16 member scientific field party, have at least 50 ft2 of clean, minimally exposed deck space available for storage and operation of air compressor and SCUBA tanks, have dry storage area for at least 150 ft3 in the main house for holding of scientific supplies and freshwater deck hose for the washing of diving equipment on a daily basis.	  At a minimum, the ship’s crew shall consist of a captain, engineer, and two (2) deckhands/cooks.

Experience with UXO safety requirements, render-safe procedures, and the ability to efficiently coordinate with active duty EOD personnel is needed.
For the type of work required, firms will be evaluated in terms of the staff: (a) experience (with present and other firms) and roles of staff members specifically on projects addressed in evaluation factor number one; (b) demonstrate professional staff depth in task order level project managers and senior level project managers (experience level of a minimum of 8 years in waste site restoration experience); (c) active professional registration(s) in the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, the Bahamas Islands, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, New Mexico, Utah and Puerto Rico.

The firm must identify the management staff and demonstrate their ability to manage projects within a negotiated scope, schedule and budget; competently manage/participate in meetings; accelerate overall "clean up" process; act responsively to the requirements; provide innovative solutions/ideas and effectively communicate. If your firm is proposing to team with one or more subcontractors, demonstrate your approach for completing typical IR/BRAC task orders.

If personnel are from different offices within the corporation, describe the interrelationship of the offices and how management will operate. Demonstrate that your firm has an effective cost accounting system, purchasing system, estimating system, and management information system (MIS) that fully integrates on line accumulation of cost expenditures within a week of occurrence.  The awarded contractor will be required to follow the provision – Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification, FAR 52.230-1.

The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The purpose of this initiative is to build on the work, completed to date by NCI and its collaborators, for both the adult and youth blueprints and to support implementation and evaluation through ongoing multi-organization collaborations. The collaborative efforts are described in a National Blueprint for Disseminating and Implementing evidence-Based Clinical and Community strategies to Promote Tobacco Use Cessation, September 2002 ("adult blueprint") and the National Blueprint for Action on Youth and Young Adult Tobacco Use Cessation, Spring 2000 ('youth blueprint").  The objective of the adult blueprint is to disseminate and implement effective methods of tobacco cessation among adults and the purpose of the youth blueprint is to develop the science base on effective methods of tobacco cessation interventions for youth.   In addition, Healthy People 2010 has identified that reducing tobacco use for the nation with a goal to improve the health of the U.S. population by reducing cigarette smoking by adults from 24 percent to 12 percent.

In accomplishing the goals of this project, the contractor shall work with the Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (YTCC) in the coordination of various meetings, workgroup activities, and to establish an executive committee to coordinate collaboration efforts for linkage to adult blueprint activities. The American Cancer Society is the only known source to the NCI with the resources for this effort.  CTC is uniquely qualified to facilitate the implementation process and dissemination of the blueprint recommendations, because of its exclusive focus on the issue of tobacco cessation, its depth of expertise on the many aspects of the issue, and its demonstrated leadership in these areas.

FACSIMILE or email offers are acceptable EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FAR 52.212-2) (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.  BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of simplified acquisition procurements and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.	Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other proposals warrant doing so. The statement of work included serves as the Government's baseline requirements. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against these value characteristics listed below which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements. The value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer, which provides better results for a reasonable increase in price. All these factors combined are approximately equal to cost or price.  On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation. The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement: 1. The laser meets or exceeds the requirements of the SOW. 2. Quality of equipment and facilities of the offeror proposed to perform the work specified. 3. Relevant qualifications and experience of the offeror’s personnel. 4. Quality of offeror’s past performance on lasers delivered to previous customers. 5. Quality of the experience, creditability, reliability, laser repair and maintenance, and customer service of the offeror. 6. Quality of the laser system to be provided. If the end product(s) offered is other than domestic end product(s) as defined in the clause entitled "Buy American Act -- Supplies," the offeror shall so state and shall list the country of origin.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Project Management; USTDA Study on Port of Tanjung Priok IT Integration and Telecommunications Project; C/o Deputy Director for Development of Sea Transport Information System; Directorate General of Sea Communication; Karya Building, 14th Floor; Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat No. 8; Jakarta 10110; Indonesia; Phone/Fax: (62-21) 350-7002/350-7045.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for an Information Technology Integration and Telecommunications project at the Port of Tanjung Priok, in Indonesia.

The port of Tanjung Priok in Jakarta exports and imports the largest volume of bulk and container cargo of any port in Indonesia.  It is by far the largest single port of origin for Indonesian exports to the United States and is a key port of origin within the member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group.  Tanjung Priok’s sheer size and importance in regional and global trade require for it to have a well-organized management structure that can help to guarantee port security and efficiency.  Access to the port’s assets and adjoining areas also requires strict oversight.  Currently, there is an intricate matrix of government agencies that are responsible for administration, traffic control, security, emergency response and customs regulation.  It is therefore of priority to seek improvement on the port’s various IT systems to communicate centrally or with each other to maximize efficiency and further improve the port’s ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for export and import traffic.

With respect to the telecommunications system development, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this technical assistance include: telecommunications system review, including existing infrastructure design, distribution grid and connectivity baselines; analysis of port-agency telecommunications security functions; auditing of system functionality and emergency scenarios; development of business process requirements and gap analysis; preparation of telecommunications grid remediation report; and presentation of full system architecture.

With respect to the integrated IT system development, the TOR include: analysis of port business processes; review of existing IT software and hardware baselines; analysis of the vulnerabilities of infrastructure, port business processes and current IT systems; recommendations for process re-engineering, functionality and connectivity; development of systems, equipment and training cost estimates; development of a training plan; and ascertaining port management choices among potential U.S. sources of supply; and 
preparation of a development strategy plan and financing options.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $555,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) plans to procure with TATA Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Mumbai, India for services in providing a cohort study with the objective of estimating tobacco attributed mortality in relation to tobacco use particularly bidi smoking and smokeless tobacco.  Tobacco was a common and popular substance in India much before the introduction of commercially manufactured cigarettes.  Cigarette smoking is only a minor form of tobacco use in India.  Therefore, one has to keep a very large spectrum of tobacco smoking, chewing and applying practices in mind while talking about tobacco use in India (Note 1 - Gupta PC, Hamner JE, Murti PR:  Control of Tobacco-Related Cancers and Other Diseases.  Proceedings of an International Symposium, January 15-19, 1990, TIFR, Bombay.  Oxford University Press 1992).  Tobacco use is prevalent in all sections of the Indian society: men, women, youth, rural, urban, rich and poor with different preferences among different populations.  Smoking is generally confined to men and the most common smoking habit is bidis which deliver a comparable or greater amount of tar and nicotine.  In India, the number of deaths attributable to tobacco every year is estimated at 630,000 (Note 2 - Gupta PC:  Health consequences of tobacco use in India. World Smoking and Health, 13: 5-10, 1988). An internationally known population-based cancer registry in the city of Mumbai has been in operation for about 35 years.  The contractor shall obtain annual lists of incident cancers from the Mumbai Cancer Registry.  This list shall then be matched with the cohort list and the matched cases constitute the numerators for calculating incidence rate.  Details about the type of cancer (ICD 10 coding), mode diagnosis, extent of disease and other pertinent information shall be extracted by the contractor from the cancer registry database for successful matches.  The Epidemiology Research Unit of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research is in a unique position to carry out the proposed project within a limited time frame.  The reason is that the most difficult, time consuming part of the study-- the recruitment in the base line survey through house-to-house visits and collection of information on details of tobacco use including bidi smoking and smokeless tobacco use-- has been completed by the Institute.  Also, sufficient time has elapsed for the proposed study to be carried out with sufficient numbers of cases.  A major problem in any cohort study is the estimation of attrition due to death and migration that may distort the denominator and ultimately, the results.  At a great effort and previous expense, the TATA Institute has completed house-to-house follow-up of 100,000 persons.  Results from this follow-up survey would enable estimation of correction factors for an accurate estimation of the denominator.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on February 20, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted,  NAICS 541990

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Christi Winkler, 301-394-3385
<DESC>This notice is for information purposes.  The XM2 Gunfire Detection System is a stand-alone sensor system currently in service with the United States Special Operations Command and US contingency forces. It provides enhanced situational awareness to vehicular and ground personnel by its capability to rapidly locate the origin of threat gunfire from both vehicular platforms and stationary positions. It is currently a stand-alone sensor system. Based on mission and tactical informational requirements, i t is desired that a host FBCB2 equipped vehicle (i.e. HMMWV) be enabled to display threat gunfire information in the host vehicle only (not networked), or, networked.  The Army Research Laboratory intends to conduct an integration study with Northrop Grumm an Mission Systems, Carson CA to assess the feasibility and hardware/software interface issues involved in integrating the XM2 Gunfire Detection System with the widely deployed FBCB2 system.  ARL intends to closely cooperate with CECOM Fort Monmouth NJ, th e cognizant Army office responsible for managing, developing, logistically supporting and fielding the widely deployed FBCB2 System, one of the key building blocks of the Army's Digitized Battlefield. Any study contract awarded in relation to this announce ment may be issued by another cognizant Army Command/Agency such as CECOM, if it is determined that this approach would be more logical and expedient.  This procurement is to be acquired on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.

<DESC>Replace Clause D-FSS-468 (Dec 2003) on page 7 of RFQ No. 7FLA2-Z5-04-1370-SQ with Clause below:

D-FSS-468	NON-MANUFACTURED WOOD PACKAGE MATERIAL TO EUROPEAN UNION  (NOV 2001)
(a)	Definitions:
	“Package material,” for purposes of this clause, is defined as each separate and distinct material that by itself or in combination with other materials forms the container providing means of protecting and handling to a product.
	“Non-Manufactured wood,” is also called solid wood and defined as wood packing other than that comprised wholly of wood-based products such as plywood, particle board, oriented strand board, veneer, wood wool, etc. which has been created using glue, heat and pressure or a combination thereof.
(b)	Non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood package material used to pack items ordered for ultimate delivery to or through a European Union country must be marked and treated as to comply with the Emergency Measures (2001/219/EC) adopted by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC).  This requirement applies whether the shipment is direct to the end user or through a Government designated consolidation point.  Pallets that do not conform to the CEC’s regulation will be refused entry, destroyed or treated prior to entry.
(c)	For Department of Defense distribution facilities or freight consolidation points, all wood pallets or packing material with a probability of entering Europe must be treated and marked in accordance with DLA PROCLTR 01-15, and MIL-STD-2073-1.
(d)	Pallets and packing material shipped to FSS distribution facilities designated for possible delivery to the European Union will comply with DLA PROCLTR 01-15, and MIL-STD-2073-1.
(e)	Delays in delivery caused by non-complying pallets or wood package material will not be considered as beyond the control of the contractor.  Any applicable Government expense incurred as a result of the contractor failure to provide appropriate pallets or package material shall be reimbursed by the contractor.  Expenses may include the applicable cost for repackage, rehandling and return shipping, or destruction of pallets.

Close date of RFQ has not changed.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>SELF-DECONTAMINATING SURFACES, SOL BAA04-12, Addendum 1, 
DUE 051504, POC: DR. LEONARD BUCKLEY, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4695. Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. The Defense Sciences Office is soliciting innovative research proposals detailing research, design, demonstration, and validation of coating systems that are biocidal, renewable, and self-cleaning.  These self-decontaminating materials or coatings must be robust enough to withstand military applications.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to produce revolutionary, self-decontaminating systems that will supercede or supplement existing military decon systems. It is envisioned that surfaces developed under this effort will allow for continuous decontamination of biological agents from external, as well as internal, surfaces on military equipment.  This new capability will improve troop readiness and significantly reduce their risk of exposure to biological agents.  Current approaches do not allow for continuous decontamination of surfaces and require enormous amounts of supplies to be transported to the battlefield to support military equipment being deployed.  The biocidal mechanism(s) proposed in this effort should employ a zero effluence system.  Furthermore, the material system(s) used must be compatible with sensitive military equipment (electronics, optics, sensors, etc), the exterior of military equipment, as well as the interiors of personnel carriers.  This is anticipated to be a two-phase program where Phase I, the development and demonstration of new materials and coating capabilities, is 18 months in duration with quantifiable intermediate milestone.  Milestone goals encompass three (3) thrust areas: surface modification, self-cleaning and renewal, and sporicide development.  First, the surface modification thrust must demonstrate biocidal activity on the surface with less than 0.5 percent additive.  This implies that a very small percentage of the bulk material will contain the biocidal compound and that most of the effective biocide will reside at the surface.  Second, the self-cleaning thrust requires the biocidal surface properties be persistent over ten (10) challenge/renewal cycles.  The third thrust, on sporicide development, requires the demonstration of a surface capable of killing or rendering spores harmless.  These milestones should encompass technologies that address the entire coating system including the self-renewable/self-cleaning aspect. 
The two-year optional Phase II effort would integrate the material and coating advancements made in Phase I into a demonstration coating system.  This coating system must have direct utility in a military system and must be compatible with all military surfaces such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and urethane-based paints.  The submission of proposals that address each of the following areas integrated within a single program is encouraged:  (a) New concepts for biocidal activity in a coating system; (b) Approaches that are compatible with existing resin systems; and (c) Concepts for self-renewable/self-cleaning.  Full proposals only are being accepted with the technical proposals being no more than thirty (30) pages, this includes cover sheet information.  It is essential that the following areas are covered in the proposal:  (1) A clear statement of how the proposal addresses each of the three areas mentioned above; (2) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed. This statement should include a clear set of program objectives; and (3) A specific set of quantitative milestones for the 18 month Phase 1 program.  Phase 2 milestones should be included as an option.  Please put the phrase SELF-DECONTAMINATING SURFACES in the title of the proposal.  For complete details on writing a full proposal please see original FEDBIZOPS solicitation, BAA04-12 http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm).  To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS), NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, INTENDS TO SOLICIT PROPOSALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES AS 
RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN COMPLEX DISEASE. THE MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING A UNITED STATES NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY.  A SECOND MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING THREE INDIVIDUAL, DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE).  THIS WILL INVOLVE  RESEARCHING RELEVANT ISSUES AND MAKING A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH.  PREVIOUS TWIN STUDIES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF THIS TYPE OF FAMILY DESIGN IN ETIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.  THE USE OF TWINS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE STATISTICAL POWER OF A GENETIC STUDY BY EXPLOITING THE UNIQUE DEGREE OF SHARING (BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL) AMONG TWINS.  COMPARISON  OF CONCORDANCE RATES FOR A TRAIT OR DISEASE AMONG MONOZYGOTIC (MS) AND DIZGOTIC (DZ) TWINS ALLOW  FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THAT CONDITION IS DUE TO HEREDITARY SHARED OR NONSHARED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE MAJOR TASKS AS FOLLOWS: (1) PROVIDE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT POPULATION OF TWINS IN THE US AND STRATIFY THEM INTO DEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS BASED ON THEIR ZYGOSITY, AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, SES, URBAN LIVING CATEGORIES, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITHIN THE US, ETC.  THIS WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY SUB-POPULATIONS WITH CONSISTENTLY LOW RATES OF RESEARCH PARTICIPATION WHOM MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CONSIDERATIONS. (2) PROVIDE IN-DEPTH CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE U.S. THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TYPE 1 DIABETES, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, OR SYSTEMIS LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  AS PART OF THIS TASK INVESTIGATE AND DESCRIBE THE PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN EXISTING TWIN REGISTRIES AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN TWIN RESEARCH PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY REGISTRIES, ACADEMIC, OR OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  (3) EVALUATE THE ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING A NATIONAL AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DISCUSS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY (HIPAA) AND THE PRIVACY ACTS AND HOW HEY MIGHT AFFECT ESTABLISHING THESE REGISTRIES OR DISSEMINATING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE, AND HOW THESE ISSUES RELATE TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN, SUBJECTS WITH DIMINISHED CAPACITY, WOMEN, MINORITIES, ETC.  (4) ESTIMATE WHAT PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS DESCRIBED IN TASKS 1 AND 2 ABOVE WOULD LIKELY BE WILLING TO ENROL IN A TWIN REGISTRY AND PARTICIPATE IN REGISTRY SPONSORED RESEARCH PROGRAMS.  THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD RECOMMEND VARIOUS ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE RECRUITMENT OF THE GENERAL US TWIN POPULATION, AS WELL AS SPECIAL ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR SUBGROUPS WITH HISTORICALLY   LOW RECRUITMENT RATES (MINORITIES, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING, WOMEN, RURAL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, LOW SES GROUPS, ETC.)  (5) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  IF SUCH A NATIONAL REGISTRY IS NOT DEEMED FEASIBLE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONCEIVE, RESEARCH AND EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OF CREATING US TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES. (6) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING RESOURCES OF TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  BASED ON THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASK 2,3, AND 4, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING THREE NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TWIN AFFECTED WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE.  (7) MEET AND DISCUSS WITH THE NIEHS PROJECT OFFICERS AND A PANEL OF EXPERTS THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  ONCE TASK 1-6 ARE COMPLETED, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COMPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT LISTING AND DISCUSSING HOW THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASKS 1-4 AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NIEHS-SPONSORED PROGRAMS MIGHT AFFECT THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED AND THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  (8) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  THIS SHOULD INCLUDE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES FOR WOMEN AND SUB-POPULATIONS WITH HISTORICALLY LOW RESEARCH  PARTICIPATION RATES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTIONS OF MINORITY SUBGROUPS.  (9) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE NATIONAL REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, SLE AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING AFFECTED TWIN RESOURCES.  FOR EACH CONDITION, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVISE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY BOTH INCIDENT AND PREVALENT CASES.  (10) ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CURRENT AND PROJECTED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE, INDIVIDUAL DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES, OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING U.S. TWINS RESOURCES.  THESE ANALYSES SHALL INCLUDE THE COSTS OF OPERATING SUCH REGISTRIES ON A YEARLY BASIS FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS.  THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS.  THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 5,772 DIRECT LABOR HOURS MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS  PROJECT.  THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODE (NAICS) IS 541710.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS  SET-ASIDE OF WHICH THE SIZE STANDARD IS 500 EMPLOYEES  OR  LESS.  THE  ANTICIPATED  RELEASE DATE OF THE RFP IS FEBRUARY 27, 2004 WITH PROPOSALS DUE BY APRIL 16, 2004.

<ARCHDATE>01312005
<CONTACT>Amy Ellis,937.255.2898
<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or a social security card  for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.

THIS IS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. *****This solicitation, W914NS-04-Q-0134, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13 and DFARS Change Notice 20020531.  The associated NAICS code is 423860.*****The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Baghdad, Iraq has a requirement for ten (10) RHIB boats (Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat) with five (5) to be delivered NLT 2 Apr 04 and the remaining five (5) to be delivered NLT 1 Sep 04 to Umm Qasr Naval Base, Iraq.  The Key User Requirements are:
a.)  to operate safely offshore, on major rivers and estuarine waters up to and including sea state 4. b.)  to be operated by a crew of 2. c.)  to carry up to 6 passengers, each with 20 Kg of equipment.  d.) To provide a stable platform from which to conduct boarding operations.  It is envisaged that a boat length of 22 ft is the minimum required.  e.)  To have main propulsion system redundancy.  f.) to be capable of 35 knots (26 knots fully laden in calm conditions) g.) to have an endurance of 8 hours (patrol speed) or 3 hours (max speed).  Range of 100nm.  h.) to be supplied with a road-transportable trailer. i.) to be inter-operable with Coalition Forces (CF) and other Iraqi agencies. 
The ability to exhibit presence and effectively patrol Iraq’s territorial and estuarine waters and inland waterways is seen as a fundamental requirement needed to counter illegal activities which threaten the stability and security of a strategically vital region of Iraq. The standing up of an effective indigenous force capable of asserting itself on Iraq’s territorial and estuarine waters is therefore necessary.  The ICDF maritime capability is being developed by CMATT (Coalition Military Assistance Training Team.)  To provide the boarding capability required, it has been determined that there is a requirement for a medium sized RHIB powered by an out-board motor (OBM.)  OBMs are the preferred type of propulsion because they are more suited to the local environmental conditions and are considered more practical to maintain in the existing maintenance infrastructure.  Specifically, inboard engines are particularly susceptible to fuel contamination problems caused by micro-bacterial contamination (cladisporium resinae) which is prevalent in hot, humid conditions.  OBMs may also be removed from the boats for maintenance in a protected and climatically controlled environment ashore.  Particularly in view of the requirement to operate in offshore waters, a twin engine configuration is required to provide an appropriate level of propulsion system redundancy.	To develop the initial operating capability, it is calculated that 10 fast support craft will be required.  This will support the CMATT supervised training program and meet the force level needed to conduct the mission tasks throughout the AO.  The key tasks and priorities identified are as follows:	Primary Tasks:  Provision of credible presence in the ICDF AO.  Interdiction operations against vessels and personnel engaged in illegal activity.  Board and search operations against suspect vessels.  Protection of key Iraqi maritime facilities, including ports and offshore installations.  Operations with Coalition Forces.    Secondary Tasks:  Movement of ICDF personnel between locations across the AO.  Provision of support to civil authorities. 	Development of interoperability with Iraqi civil organizations in pursuit of regional security.	Development of interoperability for Joint and Combined Operations.
REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATIONS:  Ten craft will be required to meet the scope of the ICDF tasks.  The boats will require a range of 100 nautical miles, a top speed of 35 knots, an endurance of 8 hours at patrol speed and 3 hours at maximum speed.  The craft should be capable of carrying up to 8 people, each carrying 20 kilos of equipment.  Boarding operations will be carried out against a wide variety of vessels including; fishing vessels, dhows, oil barges and general cargo vessels in conditions up to Sea State 4.
A training program will commence mid Mar 04, with an operational capability in place by Oct 04.  A lack of ICDF capability to conduct effective maritime operations will ultimately impact upon the security of the region and in particular upon the operation of the only port facility in Iraq. 
SUMMARY:  The ICDF will need to operate boats capable of conducting boarding and search operations in Iraqi waters.  This capability will form a highly visible element of Iraq’s own security arrangements which are an essential part of the overall Security Sector Reform process.  The boats need to be delivered in time for specialist training to commence in mid Mar 04 (first 5 vessels) with the remaining 5 needed no later than 1 Sep 04.  These boats must be sufficiently robust to operate in the local conditions and should provide a long term and sustainable capability.  CMATT will oversee the introduction of these boats and provide the necessary training to Iraqi personnel to ensure that the maximum effect is achieved.

<DESC>In order to best meet the needs of the Institution,  listed below are the specific requirements necessary to certify the three(3) Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms (NPIR's) selected for use  by institution executive staff.  These NPIR's are to be used as engineered isolation rooms for the safe isolation of suspect or confirmed tuberculosis infected inmates.  

The selected contractor must perform the following:

- Certify in writing that each NPIR meets or exceeds the newly adopted Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO), January 1, 2003 EC 3.2, 1.7 and 10.4 standards.

- Certify in writing that each NPIR meets or exceeds the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities, 1994 Vol. 43/No. RR-13.

- Generate a written report of all findings. Preliminary Draft within seven (7) days, final report within 30 days.

- Guarantee each NPIR will pass accreditation inspection or governmental review within the one year time frame of the Certification Certificate.

- Measure and calculate actual Air Changes per Hour (ACH)  for each room.

- Measure air exchange efficiency at the patient's head and bed area using digital laser particle counter technologies, in order to provide a quantitative measurement of the NPIR's ability to protect the healthcare workers entering the room from tuberculosis bacterium exposure.

- Measure volume air flow (CFM) at each air intake and outlet diffusers/grilles of each NPIR.

- Quantitatively and qualitatively measure negative pressure differential in each room.

- Inspect the fixed manometer gauge for proper functioning and calibration on each NPIR.

- Evaluate room seal integrity and establish room efficiency as related to AIA standards.

- Examine placement of objects within the room which may create dead air or circulatory "short circuiting" of air flow within each NPIR.

-  Change HEPA and pre-filters for each NPIR.  Prepare filters for disposal as bio-hazardous waste per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1030 requirements. NOTE: FMC-Devens will supply new HEPA, pre-filters, and bags needs for bag in/bag out.

- Supply written copy of contractor's safety procedure for filter change to FMC-Devens Safety Department for review.

<DESC>POC:  Douglas Smith, Contract Specialist, (703) 767-9409, Defense Energy Support Center, (DESC-EA).
 
DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and, Fort Dix, New Jersey, as well as McGuire AFB, New Jersey, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Water at Fort Dix and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Dix/McGuire, New Jersey.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Fort Dix, NJ and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  The same can be said for McGuire AFB, NJ.
 
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire water and wastewater utility systems and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include water commodity.  
 
INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
 
Note:	(1).  All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  Companies responding to this notice of interest are responsible for verification of all inventory data.
 
(2).  Companies responding to this notice of interest shall respond to interest in the entire scope of the requirement.
 
Fort Dix Army Reserve and McGuire Air Force Base are located in central New Jersey, 18 miles southeast of Trenton, 45 miles east of Philadelphia, and 80 miles south of New York City. McGuire AFB is bordered on the west, south, and east by Fort Dix Army reservation.  
 
INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION: 
 
McGuire AFB is located on 3,598 acres of Air Force owned land.  It has 751 buildings with a total of 4,278,000 square feet of commercial type building space, 400,000 square feet in the New Jersey Air National Guard facilities and 2,306,000 square feet of military family housing facilities.
 
The Fort Dix Army Installation is located on 30,697.6 acres directly adjacent to the McGuire Air Force Base. There are 1115 commercial type buildings with a total square footage of 6,113,732 and 336 family housing units with a total square footage of 830,605.
 
 
Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consists of the following capital assets:

Fort Dix:
 
A. Water Plant, Distribution System, and Range Wells
The primary water supply source, which supplies Fort Dix, is surface water from the Rancocas Creek, located 5 miles from the water plant.  The raw water is captured at the river and is pumped by three pumps via two 16-inch water lines to the water treatment plant.  The pumping station and pipeline can deliver 4 MGD of raw water to the treatment plant. 
 
1. Water Treatment Plant: The water treatment plant original plant design is 2 MGD and is presently being upgraded to 4 MGD.  Currently sedimentation tanks are being added to the plant.  The treatment consists of pumping the surface water directly to the plant.  Treatment at the plant consists of chemical addition, flocculation, sedimentation, final filtering, and disinfection with chlorination.  After treatment, the water flows to a 500,000 gallon ground storage clear water reservoir.  The treated water is pumped from the ground storage to elevated tanks that provide distribution storage and pressure.  
 
2. Water Distribution System: The water distribution system ranges in size from 2 inches to 16 inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is approximately 527,423 feet.  Within the system there are approximately 341 isolation valves and 475 fire hydrants.  Water storage tanks: There are four water storage tanks with a combined capacity of 2,184,000 gallons.  
 
3. Range Wells:  There are 14 range wells included in this privatization effort which supply water to various ranges located throughout Fort Dix.
 
  
B. Wastewater Treatment Plant, Collection System, and Land Application Site
 
1. Wastewater Treatment Plant:  The wastewater treatment plant was constructed at Fort Dix in 1994 and is situated on and includes approximately 50 acres of land, which is also included in this privatization effort.  The wastewater plant serves Fort Dix and McGuire AFB.  The wastewater treatment facility has an average design capacity of 4.6 MGD.  The peak design plant flow is 12.7 MGD.  The wastewater treatment plant is considered to be a tertiary treatment facility.  The primary treatment consists of two primary settling tanks that remove settleable or easily floatable material.  The sludge removed from the facility is pumped to the sludge dewatering facility for further treatment.  The flow passing through the primary tanks go into the secondary tanks.  The flow is a Bardenpho process; a variation of the active sludge process.  The process removes phosphorus and nitrogen.  The flow from the tanks enters the final settling tanks where the majorities of the solids settle out and are returned to the secondary treatments tanks.  Excess sludge is wasted to the thickener.  Following the final settling tanks the flow enters the gravity filtration tanks where the suspended solids are reduced below 10mg/l and the flow is disinfected by ultraviolet radiation.  
 
2. Wastewater Collection system: The sewer system at Fort Dix consists of a collection system, a number of lift stations and a wastewater treatment plant.  Wastewater collection system pipes range in size from less than 4 inches to 36 inches.  The total length of the sewer collection system is about 267,000 linear feet.  The majority of the line is 8 inches in diameter.  There are about 1,056 manholes located throughout the sewer system.  The sewage flows to the lift station where it is pumped to the treatment plant.  Lift Stations: There are 15 lift stations in the wastewater collection system and once the upgrade contract is complete the number will be reduced to 13 lift stations. 
 
3. Land Application Site (LAS):  The land application site consists of approximately 100 acres of land included in this transfer, 22,760 linear feet of 22-inch force main, and 13 each sampling wells surrounding the LAS.  After disinfection at the wastewater treatment plant, the flow enters the effluent pump station where it is pumped to the LAS and goes into percolation lagoons.  The effluent percolates from the lagoons and recharges the groundwater.
 
McGuire AFB
 
A. Wastewater Collection System:  
All wastewater generated at McGuire AFB is treated at the Fort Dix Wastewater Treatment Plant.  McGuire wastewater collection system consists of a system of gravity and force sewer mains and eight lift stations and four pumping stations.  The wastewater collection system pipe sizes range from 2 inches to 27 inches in diameter, with the majority of the system being 8 inches in diameter.  The total length of the sewer collection system is about 145,563 linear feet.  Most of the network of piping was relined between 1994 and 1996.  The approximate year of construction is identified as 1995 to represent the mid-point of the construction projects to re-line the collection system piping.  The entire wastewater collection system includes about 339 manholes, 9 manhole type lift stations, and four pumping stations.  The McGuire wastewater collection system provides service for approximately 751 facilities.  McGuire wastewater exits McGuire AFB at three separate locations for treatment at the Fort Dix facility.  Wastewater generated in the northwest portion of the installation is collected primarily through gravity mains and one pumping station.  The remainder of the wastewater collection system includes the system on the eastern and southern portions of the installation and the school system north of Wrightstown-Cookstown Road. The system does not include Falcon Courts North and Falcon Courts East Military Family Housing (MFH) areas and a small trailer court, although wastewater from the housing areas and trailer court will flow through the main base system and for treatment at the Fort Dix Wastewater Treatment Plant.  McGuire AFB (including MFH) is currently generating approximately 483 million gallons of wastewater per year.  Base personnel indicated that there were no capacity problems with the collection system.  
REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Fort Dix and McGuire AFB is to transfer all capital assets of the water and wastewater treatment facilities to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within the Fort Dix and McGuire AFB and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Fort Dix plant.  
 
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the water system at Fort Dix and wastewater utility systems at Fort Dix/McGuire AFB. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the State of New Jersey and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact, phone no. and e-mail address.
 
SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  
 
DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EA) by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on Friday, March 5, 2004.  Sources may address responses to:  Defense Energy Support Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Room 3830, ATTN:  Douglas Smith, DESC-EA, Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-6222.

<DESC>Reference Number: F73AUD33531100, This office is searching for companies that can provide products to encompass converting existing courses/ content (i.e. paper, CD-ROM, ect.) to network-centric learning or developing new course/ content work for network-centric learning delivery.  Work could include the following: design/ re-design, testing and in some cases maintenance of network-centric instructions to Air Force Institute of Advanced Distance Learning (AFIADL).  Responding parties to this sources sought should be well versed, and able to follow current Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformance specifications for course tagging and manifest creation.  We are including the Statement of Need (SON) for this requirement and is as follows: 1.  IAW AFI 36-2201V4, Air Force Training Program, Managing Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), dated 23 Oct 2002, the Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning (ADIADL) was made the Air Force focal point for all ADL.  ADL is any method of training when an instructor is not present.  Paragraph 1.4.5 provides AFIADL the authority to assist Air Force customers to use contract support to develop or redesign courseware for ADL.  For the scope of this SON, ADL pertains to the on-line, net-centric learning piece only.  2.  ADL is an evolutionary process leading to on-line execution of education and training.  ADL objectives include converting existing courses/content to ADL instruction, developing new course/content material using current and progressive techniques, and efficiently provide course/content access in manageable ways to deliver training anywhere and at anytime.  3.  Requirements are on an “as needed” basis.  Contractors will need to work closely with government and other contractor officials depending on the work requirement issued.  4.  Contractors shall use tools that generate industry standards-compliant HTML code or content, and that there should be no excessively proprietary components used.  Contractors should follow current Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformance specifications for course tagging and manifest creation.  Monolithic programming tools should be avoided to the greatest extent possible.  5.  For delivery orders under each contract, separate and distinct project phases will be employed.  Phases will be used to facilitate course/content development, approval, and quality assurance for each/any order issued.  Entry into subsequent phases will be dependent upon review and acceptance of the work performed in the preceding phase.  The government may opt to not continue into the next phase and conclude the delivery order at its discretion.  Milestone decision points will be employed between each phase to validate and approve exit of previous phase and entry into next phase (entrance and exit criteria).  Additionally, Interim Progress Reviews will be used to confirm that the contract is progressing within the phase as planned or to adjust the plan to better accommodate progress made to date, change circumstances, or both.  a.  Phase I of the project will encompass project analysis and evaluation and is based upon the statement of objective/statement of work (SOO/SOW) issued by the government.  Contractors will provide a White Paper (not to exceed 10 pages) and shall include details of their proposed solution/approach and deliverables; describe work to be performed and the offeror’s expertise to effect the proposed approach; and present estimated costs and schedule.  b.  Phase II is the prototype development and demonstration.  The government will review the contractor’s prototypes resulting for acceptance.  The contractor will demonstrate their prototypes in its intended environment (i.e., repository, LMS, etc.) and is designed to confirm the ability of the course/content to operate in a useful way and to effectively achieve learning performance/outcomes.  Prototypes will be evaluated against the SOO/SOW and the specific type of learning needs/requirements and performance outcomes identified by AFIADL’s customer.  Entry into Phase III signifies the final proposal selection and acceptance by the government.  c.  Phase III is the course/content development and deployment phase.  The objective is to achieve and operationally viable course/content that satisfies and needs/requirements.  The course/content must have proven maturity prior to deploying to the operational environment.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) criteria (i.e., field tests for technical and learning facets conducted under realistic operational conditions, etc.) shall be employed by the offeror.  If Phase IV is not included in the SOO/SOW, Phase III will also contain an evaluation of the contractor’s performance.  d.  Phase IV is the operations and support phase.  This phase shall be authorized as an option dependent upon the needs/requirements of AFIADL’s customer and/or availability of funding (e.g., availability of in-house sustainment, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) that identifies deficiencies and evaluates operational effectiveness (i.e., technical and learning facets, etc.).  6.  The government requires an evaluation of the contractor’s proposal for past performance and other qualitative measures beyond price alone.  The objective for this requirement is to obtain cutting edge, state-of-the-art learning tools.  When submitting information regarding your company, please include the Market Research Survey that is included in this notice.  You may also include any product information that can help us in establishing our requirement.  DO NOT send proprietary data, we are seeking companies that can provide products that will be able to maintained by the government or other means to keep end-products updated.

<DESC>The New Initiatives Office of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA") is interested in meeting with vendors in late February, 2004 for informal discussions in regarding the technical issues and options for developing deformable secondary mirrors for future giant telescopes.  These discussions will help to determine the feasibility, and the define the requirements of two Request’s for Proposals (RFP’s) tentatively scheduled to be released in mid-2004:

(1) The first RFP will seek qualified vendors and research institutions to develop a conceptual design for a complete deformable secondary mirror system with a 2-3 meter clear aperture diameter for a 30-meter class giant telescope.

(2) The second RFP will seek qualified vendors to design, fabricate, and test a 1-meter class subscale prototype mirror facesheet, using materials, fabrication technologies, and test methods that are scalable to aperture diameters of 2-3 meters.  

Both RFPs are concerned with deformable secondary mirrors for use with adaptive optics (AO) in astronomy.  Adaptive optics (AO) systems remove distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence by making corrections to the incoming wavefront using one or multiple light sources as references.  Deformable secondary mirrors are an attractive   option for introducing these corrections, since they minimize the number of optical surfaces in the AO system and thereby improve throughput and minimize emissivity.  Depending on the application, telescope design, and site, our current estimates for the requirements of such a deformable mirror for a 30-meter class giant telescope include a 2-4 meter clear aperture diameter, a 2-dimensional array of actuators with 20 to 100 actuators across the diameter of the mirror, an actuator stoke of from 15 mm (with separate tip/tilt correction) to 60 mm (with tilt correction included), and mirror update rates of from 100 to 1000 Hz.  AURA is interested in meeting with vendors to discuss the potential feasibility of these requirements, as well as the design options for face sheet thickness, face sheet material, segmented vs. continuous face sheets, actuator technology, actuator influence functions, optical test methods, and face sheet surface quality and roughness.

The two RFPs will be administered by AURA through the New Initiatives Office in partnership with the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project.

Interested parties should contact Andy Commissaris (Tel: 520-318-8241; Fax: 520-318-8560; email: andyc@noao.edu) with their contact information and availability for a teleconference and/or a face-to-face meeting to be located in Tucson, Arizona during the last week of February and/or first week of March 2004.  A list of topics for discussion and additional information on deformable secondary mirror requirements and their applications for future giant telescopes may be found at http://www.aura-nio.noao.edu.  A list of topics for discussion may be found under the topic “What’s New”. 

The Contracting Office for this requirement is AURA-NOAO, 950 N. Cherry Ave, Tucson, AZ  85719.  Please contact Andy Commissaris (Tel: 520-318-8241; Fax: 520-318-8560; email: andyc@noao.edu) regarding this notice.

The main objective is to obtain a 200-round Soft  Pack that will be more durable and provide improved retention to the weapon  under field conditions while reducing ammunition “rattling” noise levels when  employed in a sustained combat environment.  The 200-round Soft Pack must  attach directly to the standard 5.56mm, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon and require  no additional equipment or hardware for attachment.  The 200-round Soft Pack  shall be capable of carrying 200 rounds of linked 5.56mm NATO ammunition.  The  200-round Soft Pack shall be comparable in size to the current hard plastic  magazine, and should be re-usable a minimum of 50 times.  The 200-round Soft  Pack should not hinder the performance or comfort of the automatic rifleman nor  shall it degrade the reliability of the weapon system or hinder the performance  of the ammunition within.  The 200-round Soft Pack shall be capable of storage  and operation in hot, basic, and cold climates in accordance with U.S. Army  Regulation 70-38.  The 200-round Soft Pack shall contain no hazardous materials  according to EPA 17.  Please advise if your product is a commercially available  item.  Interested firms should submit literature/brochures not exceeding twenty  (20) pages describing their technical capabilities and specifications, and  systematically address each of the requirements listed above in response to the  aforementioned criteria.

<SUBJECT>C--Ashtabula River Contaminated Sediments Dredging Project
<SOLNBR>W912P4-SO-U-RCES
<RESPDATE>020604
<ARCHDATE>04062004
<CONTACT>lorraine.mcmullen, (716)879-4249
<DESC>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Ashtabula River Partnership have proposed a plan for ecosystem restoration in the Ashtabula River, Ashtabula Ohio.  The project scope covers contaminated sediment dredging, dewatering, water treatment, transpo rtation and disposal. The Ashtabula River is located in northeast Ohio on the northeast shores of Lake Erie.  In 1985, the area was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission (IJC), characterizing it as an area with impaired beneficial uses.  T he impaired beneficial uses derived from the presence of contaminated sediment.  Much of the sediment in the river Federal is sufficiently contaminated to require environmental controls during dredging. A recommended remedial plan involves: 1) mechanical dredging of approximately 700,000 cubic yards (in situ) of contaminated sediments from the river, 2) treatment of sediments as necessary to meet disposal requirements, 3) transporting to and disposal of t he treated sediment in either a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and/or non-TSCA (NTSCA) permitted landfill (based upon previously established cut-lines and chemical analysis).   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is presently in the process of design and will develop plans and specifications for the dredging and disposal of the contaminated sediments from the lower Ashtabula River.  The plans and specifications will be then used as a basis for the project construction solicitation. INFORMATION SOUGHT: The intent of this Sources Sought Announcement is the generation of information regarding potentially qualified parties capable of executing this plan.  USACE is interested in submissions related to one or more of the following technical objectives of the project: Ã‚Â·	Dredging of contaminated sediments Ã‚Â·	Treatment (including dewatering and water treatment) of contaminated sediments Ã‚Â·	Transportation of treated sediments Ã‚Â·	Disposal of treated sediments Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the objective chosen and to the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications:  1) EXPERIENCE: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or bei ng performed and any in-house research and development efforts  2) PERSONNEL:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal team member or project officer  3) ASSET CAPABILITY:  Availab ility and description of special facilities or assets capable of accomplishing the technical objectives under consideration.

<SUBJECT>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT BAA-04-02:  SUBMARINE ESCAPE, RESCUE, AND DIVER SAFETY EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied biomedical research focusing on Submarine Escape and Rescue, and Diving Safety and Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more detail below. It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a period of two years from the date of this publication (or until 2/06/2006).  However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2004 and FY 2005. (1) Primary Interests  This program’s objective is to focus on Submarine Escape, Rescue, and Diver Safety Effectiveness research that can be rapidly transitioned to fleet capabilities by improving procedures or increasing levels of safety and survivability.  The typical project will be two years or less although three y ear projects are considered.  The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are:  (1) extending the capability for rescue under pressure to 5 ATA through novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to oxygen and perfluorocarbon administration; (2) evaluation aboard an operational submarine of the adequacy and effectiveness of present stores, guidance and procedures to assure survivability in a disabled submarine for seven days; (3) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine; (4)   improving understanding and guidance for surface interval risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including mitigation with various periods of oxygen breathing; (5) develop guidance and procedures for medical screening of pressurized escape trainees for pulmonary over-inf lation syndrome risk; (6) extending the capability for escape to depths deeper than 600 feet through improved escape procedures and equipment; (7) improved senior survivor decision tools;  (8) improving critical care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S. Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System. The areas of primary interest in diving safety and effectiveness are:  (1) development of new decompression models that improve safety, reduce decompression time, and track nitrogen and helium simultaneously; such models should allow integration across the full spectrum of diving including single and multilevel dives, repetitive dives, and surface-decompression dives; (2) improved equipment and procedures for contaminated water diving, development of  field-deployable screening tests for biologic and chemical contamination, improved laboratory assays for contam inants in salt and brackish water and development of decontamination techniques, including rapid decontamination techniques that will allow employment of surface decompression tables, and improved risk assessment and management techniques; current contaminated water scenarios of greatest interest are fuel oils, human remains, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and heavy metals; (3) improved understanding of short and long term  oxygen toxicity associated with prolonged and repeated exposure to increased partial pressure of oxygen, including pulmonary oxygen toxicity and myopia; (4) improved active and/or passive diver thermal protection for free swimming divers, to extend effective dive duration and operational performance through improved suit and insulating materials; (5) develop and/or refine noise protection exposure limits, monitoring and protection across the spectrum of underwat er sound, including underwater blast and impulse noise; (6) develop improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures and accelerated nitrogen-oxygen saturation decompression; (7) develop no-decompression curves for no-stop downward excursion dives on helium-oxygen from helium-oxygen saturation storage depths of 300 feet of seawater and less; (8) assessment of the long term health of divers; including but not limited to hearing, dysbaric osteonecrosis, neuropsychological disorders and neuropathies; (9) improved diagnosis of decompression illness through utilization of algorithms; (10) electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base; (11) improved understanding of the relationship between patent foramen ovale and decompression s ickness and cerebral arterial gas embolism; (12) develop guidance for hydration to decrease or eliminate over-hydration associated immersion pulmonary edema; (13)  refine the understanding of hypercapnia in divers through direct measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension under immersed hyperbaric conditions, and development of predictive equations relating end-tidal carbon dioxide tension to arterial tension as a means to estimate arterial carbon dioxide tension accurately and non-invasively.  (2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals  For FY04, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals  is 3:00 PM CST, 26 March 2004 for the funding cycle that began 1 October 2004, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 7 June 2004. For FY05, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 25 March 2005 for the  funding cycle that begins 1 October 2005, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 8 June 2005. Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available. The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Assistant, Lisa Williams at 850-230-3205 or E-mail: lisa.m.williams@navy.mil.  The Pre-proposal should be three five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal su bmission. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required when animals are employed.  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor’s committee for protection of human subjects.  This evaluation must conform with current Department of the Navy instructions relating to the use of human subjects.  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This  BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged.  Proposals will not be returned after evaluation.  (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation  Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror’s capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent  of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  “As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures establ ished by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.” If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See  instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government’s preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWCPC. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals receive d in response to this announcement. Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to CAPT John Murray, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager, (202) 781-4361.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Increase of the Monetary Ceiling of an IDIQ Contract
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform the vendor community of the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) intention to increase the maximum dollar ceiling of its Enterprise Technology Services Contract (ETSC) with Lockheed Martin Information Technology (Lockheed) by $95 million. This increase is needed because SSA has made far greater use of the ETSC than originally envisioned and the contract will reach its maximum dollar ceiling during March 2004 (a full 22 months earlier than the January 31, 2006 end date). The dollar ceiling increase will allow for continued contractor support under the ETSC during its recompetition and transition to a new contract by approximately July 2004; and, more importantly, this increase will permit work on unplanned, exigent Medicare-related changes that must begin immediately and continue uninterrupted through January 31, 2006.

The recompetition to replace the ETSC is currently underway with a draft RFP (SSA-RFP-04-1018) being released for industry comment concurrent with this notice. The resulting new contract will be of substantial value (i.e., approximately nine times the value of this noncompetitive action) and will provide industry a fair opportunity to compete for the majority of future contractor support requirements within SSA (i.e., the exception being support related to Medicare-related changes).

Up to $55 million of the monetary ceiling increase will allow for an orderly continuation of contractor support services up to award of the new contract and through a planned 3-month transition period. Up to $40 million of the monetary ceiling increase will allow uninterrupted support for implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 through January 2006.

The orderly continuation of current, on-going services can only be accomplished by Lockheed (the incumbent contractor). Additionally, only Lockheed can provide the required contractor support services that are required to implement the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 within the mandated implementation dates of that legislation since a competitive contract for such support would take at least five or six months to award given the current status of the requirements analysis and acquisition lead times for even an expedited award. SSA cannot afford this length of delay in obtaining contractor support.

This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  Pricing data is not requested or required.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information.  Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically within 5 calendar days to janequinn@ssa.gov and refer to the ETSC Modification.

<SUBJECT>L -- Industry Day 2004 - U.S. Joint Forces Command and the Hampton Roads chapter
<DESC>U.S. Joint Forces Command and the Hampton Roads chapter of NDIA have opened registration for this year's two-day industry symposium, which will focus on joint battlespace dominance, blue force situational awareness and combat identification.  U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), charged with leading the transformation effort of the U.S. military, will partner with the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) for a two-day industry symposium.
The event will be held at the Portsmouth Renaissance Hotel and Conference Center in Old Towne Portsmouth, VA commencing on 17 March 2004 through 18 March 2004.  Presenters from JFCOM and NDIA will discuss issues that focus on the theme: "Joint Battlespace Dominance through Combat Identification and Blue Force Situational Awareness."  During the symposium, presenters and panel members will provide information to government officials and industry representatives. Following each presentation, a question and answer session will focus on improved methods for the military and industry to partner together for a continuous information exchange.  According to organizers, this year's event will have a slightly different format from previous symposiums, since industry leaders will be contributing to the presentations.  Members of industry will discuss current initiatives on transforming the ways the military operates on the battlefield.  The scheduled presentations and panel discussions will focus on several areas of JFCOM's mission including joint training, joint requirements and integration, and joint experimentation. In addition to the directorate's discussions, there will also be service panel presentations.  Army Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace will be one of the featured presenters. He is the former commanding general of V Corps during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and currently serves as commanding general for the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Wallace will speak about his operational background and experiences during OIF. Prior to taking command of V Corps, Lt. Gen. Wallace served as director of joint training at USJFCOM.  Event organizers believe it is beneficial to build and maintain strong relationships with industry leaders. During this event industry leaders will also obtain information about the future joint environment.  According to organizers, working with industry allows JFCOM to impact research and development as well as accelerate the solutions for the joint warfighting capabilities.  For more information about Industry Day, visit the Hampton Roads chapter of the NDIA at http://www.ndia-ghrc.org.
