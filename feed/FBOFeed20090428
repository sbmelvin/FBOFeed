All proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

The PMC uses analog computation to assist in the control of a gas turbofan engine fuel system.  The fuel system consists of the PMC, a Main Engine control (MEC), and various sensors which transmit signals to both the PMC and MEC.  The PMC interprets signals from the sensors and MEC and sends control signals to the MEC and airplane cockpit.  Function:  PMC is an electronic over-ride on the hydro-mechanical MEC, which sets fan corrected speed as a function of the power lever angle (PLA).  The same PLA will always provide the same percentage of the rated thrust available at a given flight condition.  The PMC also provides protection against excessive fan and core speed, and reduces transient EGT overshoot.Delivery:   Item 0001:  8 EA 30 days ARO and receipt of reparable assets.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;The 911th Airlift Wing, Coraopolis, PA., 15108 intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to award a single, firm fixed-price contract to provide for all labor, transportation, materials, tools, equipment and supervision necessary for construction modernization of fire suppression system in three aircraft hangars. Work includes, but not limit to, updating and adding components of the foam system and to add components of the fire pump system. Two of the added features are a pump test header and a foam system test header. Valve tamper switches are being added to existing valves on the jockey pump suction and discharge lines. Remove the existing under-wing Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) oscillating monitor nozzle system. Remove the existing spot-type heat detection and releasing panel. Install a new fire suppression system in accordance with ETL 02-15, designed for fueled aircraft. Reuse existing ceiling preaction sprinklers and install a new supplementary low-level, high-expansion foam, activated via new foam releasing system with linear heat detection. Replace the existing clear lens notification devices installed on the foam release notification circuit with new blue lens devices. Replace the non-externally resettable deluge valves located at the preaction risers with externally resettable deluge valves. Replace all fire main lead-ins with new lead-ins located in an underground concrete trench. Install a surge tank, with a capacity of not less than 10 gallons, on each riser for the hangar bay overhead preaction sprinkler system. Recalculate the preaction systems based on the design densities provided in ETL 98-8 to ensure that the correct demand is available. Install a foam test header and provide at least four (4) valved hose connections. Replace the existing building fire alarm system (fire alarm panel, initiating devices, notification devices, etc). Add a fire suppression equipment room to house the new high expansion foam system. Room will be 18 feet by 31 feet, located adjacent to the mechanical room, built using CMU block walls with brick exterior and rubber membrane roof. Relocate hot water tank and create doorway from existing mechanical room to new fire equipment room. Demolish Building 413, the water storage building for the existing fire system in Buildings 416 and 417. Remove all pumps, tanks, valves and piping from Building 412, which currently houses this existing fire system. Install a fire pump test header equipped with at least ten valved hose connections. Install two shut-off valves in the sanitary sewer drains. All work shall be accomplished in strict accordance with the contract documents. The estimated cost ranges between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The NAICS code is 238220. The applicable size standard is $14 million. Invitation for Bid solicitation package will be available o/a 13 May 09. Tentative bid opening date is 12 Jun 09. Performance period is phased with no one hangar out of service more than 60 days. This action is being procured as a Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 52.219-27. Offers are solicited only from service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Offers received from concerns that are not service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered. Funds are not presently available for this project.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice for: Aggregate Effects of Research and Environmental Mitigation Monitoring of Oil Industry Operation in the Vicinity of Nuiqsut
PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract with anticipated period of performance of twenty four (24) months for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services.PURPOSE: The Minerals Management Service is seeking contractors support to evaluate mitigation effectiveness of potential impacts on subsistence hunting activities from six oil and gas development projects near the North Slope Borough community of Nuiqsut.  The six projects encompass both offshore and onshore facilities on both Federal and State lands. The study seeks to improve the effectiveness of industrys pre-lease mitigation strategies and post lease operations to ensure that intended environmental protections occur through adaptive management practices. The need for this research is supported by previous social research which indicates that North Slope oil development, in some cases, has reduced access to hunting and fishing areas, altered habitat, and intensified competition for fish and wildlife by non-subsistence hunters.The study will be conducted with the help of an Interagency Steering Committee, formed under the multilateral authority of the Executive Oversight Group of the North Slope Science Initiative, and acting in an advisory capacity to MMS.   The study will result in a technical report that includes an inventory of planned mitigation for the six projects, history of mitigation measures, and results of analysis of all information collected; a technical summary of the research, and a draft journal article for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal. 
OBJECTIVE/GOAL:  The primary goal is to evaluate mitigation effectiveness for Nuiqsut subsistence activities across six different development and projects will be accomplished through the following intermediate task/objectives:
Systematically inventory the various mitigation measures that federal and state government agencies have imposed on oil and gas exploration and development operations to protect subsistence activities in the vicinity of Nuiqsut. Document the various formal and informal mechanisms that industry has proposed and implemented to mitigate specific anticipated impacts from oil development in the vicinity of Nuiqsut and its subsistence area, both onshore and offshore.Develop a rigorous and appropriate analytic method to evaluate the social effectiveness of mitigation measures as they pertain to Nuiqsut subsistence activities, with appropriate opportunity for input from various informed representatives of community, industry, and government sectors.Establish an empirical basis to distinguish any relevant differences between offshore/onshore oil related social impacts and mitigation strategies as they pertain to the community of Nuiqsut.Provide socio-cultural insights into the various challenges of mitigation processes to enhance government performance in predicting, monitoring, and managing the oil development process.
DESCRIPTION OF WORK
All phases of this study shall be conducted in collaboration with the MMS and key stakeholders at the community level.  The Contractor shall abide by conventional social science ethical guidelines, including the Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic, and the utilization of social data throughout the course of the study and future publication efforts.  The research shall be designed and administered so that information needs are met with minimal disruption to local informants and ongoing subsistence activities in Nuiqsut.  The research shall be designed in such a way that it does not require OMB clearance for data collection.
The study will research and document both the objective and subjective dimensions of mitigation effects from recent development projects. Data will be gathered from historical records, field visits, and directed conversation with knowledgeable informants who can accurately represent the various perspectives of community, industry, and government. There will be no broad survey of community residents. 
HOW TO RESPOND: For a full copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Olivia F. Adrian via email at olivia.adrian@mms.gov  Please include in your request the Solicitation Number M09PS00059 and title Aggregate Effects of Research and Environmental Mitigation Monitoring of Oil Industry Operation in the Vicinity of Nuiqsut, your organizations name, point of contact, Dunn & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address.

<RESPDATE>051509
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Services (DCCPS) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services to provide two separate manuscripts for the purpose of evaluating trends in costs and types of care in both colorectal and lung cancer patients in the first year following diagnosis using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data with Dr. Cathy Bradley; 3401 Brewton Way; Midlothian, Virginia 23113-3794.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 the business size standard is 7.0 M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement shall be twelve months from the date of award.

The Division of Cancer Control and Population Services (DCCPS) has previously conducted cohort studies of patients with colorectal and lung cancer relating to cost of treatments and care  these cancers are two of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and leading causes of cancer death in the U.S. Prevalence is expected to increase because the US population is growing and aging, and cancer incidence increases with age. Thus, the medical costs of treating colorectal and lung cancers are also likely to increase as well. A recent study of trends in the cost of care in the first year following cancer diagnosis showed that costs are increasing, due in part, to more patients receiving surgery and adjuvant therapy, and rising prices for these treatments. 

The professional services of Dr. Cathy Bradley will be obtained to lead a new project providing updated estimates in the trends in costs and types of care colorectal and lung cancer patients receive in the first year following diagnosis using the linked SEER-Medicare data. These services will evaluate trends in care regarding:

	Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy
	Type of cancer-directed surgery (if any) received
	Receipt of radiation therapy
	Receipt of specific types of chemotherapy and supportive agents and other services
	Trends in costs of care by type of service

All services and costs will be reported separately by stage of disease at diagnosis.

In addition, contractor will provide the following deliverables:

	Review the published literature on care and associated costs of care of colorectal and lung cancer
	Develop table shells and lead analysis of trends in colorectal cancer care and collaborate closely with NCI scientific staff on analysis of trends in lung cancer care.
	Provide NCI with written report/manuscripts suitable for publication on trends in colorectal cancer care, and collaborate closely with NCI scientific staff on publication of trends in lung cancer care

The contractor, Cathy J. Bradley, M.P.A., Ph.D. is a Professor in the Department of Health Administration at Virginia Commonwealth University. Dr, Bradley is a health economist and an internationally recognized expert in the economic consequences of cancer and its treatment. She has more than 50 publications in this area, a solid track record of federal grant support, as well as local and national service. Her innovative work has been the subject of many editorials. Since 2000, Dr. Bradley has been the principal investigator or co-investigator for more than ten grants in health economics and cancer outcomes.  She has also been the principal investigator for previous NCI contracts in health economics and cancer.

Dr. Bradley has conducted extensive research using both registry and Medicare and Medicaid claims data to assess the types of care received by cancer patients. There are no other investigators with the breadth and depth of knowledge in the economic consequences of cancer and its treatment. Dr. Bradley's expertise in health economics and cancer-related health services research provides her with the unique skills required to perform the work under this contract.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis Neuropack 2200 Evoked Potential and EMG/NCV System from Nihon Kohden, 90 Icon Street, Foothill Ranch, CA 92810. <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.5 to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. <br />The Human Cortical Physiology Section (HCPS) conducts clinical and research studies on normal volunteers and patients with neuromuscular disorders. Most of the HCPS' studies involve presenting a stimulus (auditory, electrical, or magnetic) to the subject, and recording the responses from different areas of their brain or muscles. An EMG (electromyography) machine is used to record the responses. The HCPS is currently using an EMG machine that is over 20 years old and was manufactured by Dantec who no longer provides services or parts for the old model machine. In order to maintain compatibility with ongoing studies, it is critical that the HCPS purchases a new EMG machine. The Nihon Kohden machine has the features that are required as follows: <br />&bull; 8 Channels of Analog In (used for startle and blink studies and for display of force, acceleration with EMG),<br />&bull; 8 Channels of Analog Out (used to port data to LabVIEW or Signal software for real-time external analysis),<br />&bull; 2 Constant Current Stimulators (required studies with electrical stimuli),<br />&bull; TTL Trigger input to trigger data collection and stimulator activation TTL Trigger output (used to synchronize with external devices in complex studies),<br />&bull; FDA approval for human use.<br />The Nihon Kohden EMG machine will be shared among the 8 researchers in 2 different testing rooms. A Nihon Kohden MEB-2200 Neuropack machine is currently being used in one of the testing rooms. Nihon Kohden machine is the only one available with 8 channel analog outputs and inputs. It also has excellent amplifiers and is very user-friendly, which is essential for HCPS lab because of the large number of fellows using the machine. In addition, the HCPS staff has invested a lot of time and work into writing software that works with this machine, and also because the same types of experiments will be conducted in both testing rooms in the HCPS lab. The Nihon Kohden Neuropack 2200 machine is the proprietary product of Nihon Kohden and can only purchased through Nihon Kohden. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

The trip contact shall also close upon flow of reverse magnetizing current of its associated transformer.

The relay shall be enclosed in a NEMA Type 6 chemically treated, waterproof drawn brass shell, and any wiring to the relay (including communication cable) shall not compromise the rating. The relay shall offer three on-board input ports that are used for external sensors when combined with the communication package; offer internal air temperature with the communication package; utilize the capability of choosing from the traditional straight-line master close curve and the modified circular closed curve; and utilize insensitive phase rotation. 
The microprocessor relay shall operate under the sequence-base algorithm, which provides a flat, unchanging trip response. The relay shall operate in a temperature range of -20OC to +110OC with exertions to +125OC; and shall have the capability to communicate information to a data concentrator over a shielded twisted pair communications cable. 

Primary Switch: 

The 15 kV primary switch is a three-position, no-load break switch. The three positions are OPEN, CLOSED, and GROUND. The closed position is the center position. The switch is key interlocked, with the transformer tap changer mechanism, such that it shall be in the ground position before the transformer taps can be changed. 

Network Transformer: 

Transformers shall have temperature gauges with re-settable maximum pointers, sampling valves, high-pressure release valves, and a key-interlocked tap changer. The transformers shall be filled with an NIH approved less flammable natural ester liquid. The tap changer shall have five settings, two above and two below the 100% rating. Each tap shall represent 2.5% of nominal voltage. Transformer windings shall be copper and full kVa rated. 

Network Protector: 

The network protector shall contain time delays and other controls to prevent pumping, defined as the cyclical opening and closing of the network protector. Spot networks shall include a remote terminal unit (RTU), a multiplexing device sending monitoring and control signals from the respective building to the campus-wide Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. 
The RTU shall be located in either the transformer vault or the secondary switchgear room and shall require a 120 V circuit. The output control voltage is 48 V DC. The network protectors shall have auxiliary relays with 48 V DC coils for shunt tripping by the RTU. The RTU shall include monitoring the following devices/functions: 
 Pressure and temperature of liquid-cooled network transformers. 
 Status of network protectors. 
Status of all secondary main and tie circuit breakers. 
 Status of any battery bank systems in substations.

If transient voltage surge suppression (TVSS) is required on switchgear, it shall be modular type and provided in the switchgear. 

The electrical arrangement of the switchgear is shown in single-line form in Figure B.5.b. Each main circuit breaker shall serve a section of the main bus. The sections shall be connected by tie breakers of the same ratings as the mains. The main and tie breakers are normally closed and electrically operated. The normally closed breakers form a spot network. The tie breakers shall sectionalize the main bus should a fault occur, minimizing the outage to one section of bus. The breakers shall be electrically operated to allow remote operation by the campus SCADA system. 

Switchgear main and tie breakers shall have discrete contacts for open close status wired to terminal strips for convenient access for SCADA connection. Switchgear shall have all potential transformer (PT) and current transformer (CT) connections wired out to shorting blocks. Switchgear IEDs shall be equipped and wired to test switches which shall allow ease of troubleshooting and repair/replacement of IEDs when necessary. 
For a spot network system, a unique dual ground bus arrangement is required for proper selective ground fault operation and isolation of a fault. Where ground fault protection is required on main circuit breakers, it shall also be provided on feeder circuit breakers to provide selective tripping of the breaker closest to the fault. Circuit breaker selection shall accommodate the inherently high available short-circuit interrupting current in a spot network system arrangement. All feeder draw-out switchgear circuit breakers shall be electronically operated. 

The control power for low-voltage circuit breakers shall be 120V AC. Over-current devices shall have short-time, long-time, ground fault, and instantaneous trip settings. 

Each incoming line shall be provided with over voltage and under voltage, and phase sequence protection. 
The switchgear shall be provided with a digital power meter measuring total power output of the switchgear. Digital readout metering shall be provided on the load side of each main circuit breaker with required metering: 

 Volts (phase-to-phase and phase-to-neutral). 
 Frequency. 
 Ampere demand (per phase and average three-phase). 
 Kilowatt hours (resettable). 
 Kilowatt demand (three-phase). 
 kVa demand (three-phase). 
 Harmonic load content (percent total harmonic distortion (THD)). 
 Power factor. 

The switchgear shall include the provision of a control power transformer associated with each switchgear section and the necessary switching logic so that there shall be 120 V relay and control power if any one of the three network transformers is energized. 

Each feeder breaker shall have self-contained local digital metering with remote reporting capability. In addition to the required SCADA metering, monitoring, and control system, the following values shall be metered: 

 Volts (phase-to-phase and phase-to-neutral). 
 Amperes. 
 Kilowatt hours (with reset). 
 Kilowatt demand. 
 Kilowatt peak demand. 
Each switchgear lineup shall have a hoist provided for lifting the circuit breakers from their withdrawn position and lowering them to a dolly or to the floor. A rail assembly shall be provided along the top of the switchgear with a hoist mechanism that can roll from end to end. 

Switchgears shall be located in dedicated electrical rooms. Piping, ducts, or equipment not serving the electrical equipment shall not be permitted to be installed in or traverse dedicated electrical rooms. 
Electrical strip heaters shall be installed in switchgear to prevent internal condensation. 
Project specifications shall require that specialized tools necessary for installation, maintenance, calibration, or testing of electrical equipment are supplied with the associated equipment and turned over to the government at the end of the construction project.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>050409
<CONTACT>Clint D Druk, Phone 301-443-0403, Email clint.druk@psc.gov - Marie L. Sunday, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-7081, Fax 301-443-2761, Email MARIE.SUNDAY@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GSA Federal Supply Sechedule, 874-1 Mission Oriented Integrated Services (MOBIS) Consulting Services, contract holders.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) legislation established a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research.  The Council is responsible for coordinating the comparative effectiveness research (CER) across relevant HHS and federal government agencies and making recommendations for the $400 million allocated to the Office of the Secretary for CER.

This contract will provide for analytical support and deliverables to assist the Council in its deliberations and strategy:  
1.	Strategic framework, criteria, and categorization scheme for CER and data infrastructure.
2.	An inventory of the current CER portfolio including research activity and data infrastructure.
3.	Final report which combines the strategic framework and inventory to identify gaps and potential priorities for future CER investment. 

A mandatory report to Congress, due June 30, 2009, calls for description of current comparative effectiveness research.  In addition, a rapid assessment of comparative effectiveness research and infrastructure (e.g. clinical data networks, registries) will be critical to informing priorities for future CER funding.  The HHS CER workgroup can help collect this information but a substantial amount of support will be needed to gather the information, assess the content, design a framework, and organize into a report.  As the Council attempts to categorize types of CER spending and determine how to spend OS funds to fill gaps, a strategic framework will be essential.  This framework should be agreed upon by the Council but an external contractor with knowledge of CER would facilitate development of the strategic framework, especially if the contractor has experience with CER and prioritization frameworks domestically and/or internationally.  

The period of performance will be one year and award is anticipated to be made on or before May 8, 2009.  The anticipated contract type is firm fixed price and will be competitively solicited pursuant to FAR Pat 8 procedures.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
Notice of Intent to Procure Expansion Space
Washington, DC


The United States Government currently occupies 14,190 ANSI BOMA Office Area Square Feet (ABOASF)/16,673 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office and related space in a building under lease in Washington, DC, that expires on April 10, 2013.  The Government has a requirement for an additional approximately 15,000 BRSF of office and related space.  The total rentable space must yield a minimum of 26,927 ABOASF.  The delineated area is Independence Ave. to the North, 2nd St. to the East, 395 to the South, and 14th St. to the West. 

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:
	Proximity to Metrorail
	Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space that can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments entire requirement for approximately 43 months, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: GSA is seeking a contractor to perform as CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) for the Edith Green Wendell Wyatt (EGWW) Federal Building Modernization Project at 1220 SW Third Avenue, Portland, OR.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Originally (approximately 2 years ago), this project envisioned a building upgrade to include ADA restrooms, seismic, electrical, HVAC distribution, complete building re-cladding, secure entry, blast and seismic resistance, lower level exit, 1st Impressions, tenant space, finishes, HVAC replacement, and security system equipment. The goal was to achieve LEED Silver Certification. Work involves renovation of about 500,000 gsf of space. The project was put on hold when Congress did not appropriate the construction funding.</p>
<p>CURRENT UPDATE: This project is now being funded under American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The project is being re-scoped to align more closely with the High Efficiency Green Building requirements (Energy Independence and Security Act, EISA) as mandated by ARRA. The re-scoping effort will include a workshop hosted by GSA in EGWW on May 14th and 15th.</p>
<p>WORKSHOP REGISTRATION: Contractors planning to compete for the CMc contract are invited to attend the workshop. Space is limited, so attendance will be limited to 1 representative per contractor. Participation will be limited to auditing the workshop only (not active participation). Interested participants should register by contacting Chad O'Brien at chad.obrien@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY STATUS (DURING CONSTRUCTION): Originally, GSA intended to renovate the building while the building was occupied, with construction activity meticulously phased around the tenant agencies, requiring tenants to be moved to swing space and back to their final space in the building. AS THE PROJECT IS BEING RE-SCOPED, GSA IS ATTEMPTING TO VACATE THE BUILDING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS.</p>
<p>PROJECT CONSTRAINTS: ARRA funding must be obligate by September 2010, meaning GSA and the CMc must reach agreement on the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) by that date. Construction funding must be expensed by September 2014. ARRA prescribed Buy American, Whistleblower, and Reporting and Invoicing requirements will be included.</p>
<p>VARIATION FROM TYPICAL CMc DELIVERY METHOD: The CMc solicitation (RFP) may require that the CMc also include or propose up to 5 first tier subcontractors. The RFP and resulting contract will include an option to acquire A-E services after award. That option would only be exercised if agreement on the A-E scope of work for CA phase services cannot be reached by GSA, the CMc, and GSA's A-E.</p>
<p>EARLY EXCHANGES: Early exchange meetings have been conducted with interested parties that responded to the original pre-solicitation notice (posted 2 years ago). GSA will meet with any party interested in competing for the CMc contract. During the meeting GSA will present a timeline of project activity to date and answer any project related questions.</p>
<p>As early exchange meetings occur, GSA will summarize those exchanges and post them with this notice. GSA will also post relevant technical documents related to this project (for example, summary of the workshop conducted on May 14th and 15th).</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The Estimated Cost of Construction is between $110,000,000.00 and $125,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: GSA has re-opened the A-E contract with the original designer, SERA Architects. SERA will be responsible for updating the technical requirement package (DDs/CDs). The CMc design phase services are projected to last 6 months. The construction duration is projected to last 30-40 months.</p>
<p>COMPETITION: Unrestricted.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING METHOD: Best Value Source Selection, Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Contract Type with Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Delivery Method with potential Award Fee. The scope of CMc services is to include Design Phase Services (constructability reviews, value engineering, project schedule and construction cost development, etc.) and Construction Phase Services (construction contract and subcontract administration, CPM scheduling, monitoring of construction costs, etc.). For this contract, technical factors will be given greater weight than price (Design Phase Services and the GMP Proposal) in the selection of a successful offeror.<br /><br />PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: GSA presently plans to evaluate proposals in two Phases. In Phase 1, offerors will be evaluated on technical factors including qualifications, past performance, and key personnel. Phase 2 offerors will be evaluated on submission of their GMP Proposal consisting of a conceptual estimate and pricing for Design Phase Services, and any other requirements stated in detail in the RFP. PLEASE NOTE, THE ACTUAL PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CHANGE BASED ON FEEDBACK RECEIVED DURING EARLY EXCHANGE ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: A guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contract will be awarded.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: Presently, the RFP expected release date is July 7, 2009. GSA is attempting to better that date and may post a draft copy.</p>
<p>PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE: A pre-proposal conference is likely to be conducted. The conference date will be confirmed via posting in FBO at a later date.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION DISTRIBUTION METHOD: Exclusively via FedBizOpps electronic postings. No paper documents will be issued.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION: It is strongly recommended that interested parties click on "Add Me to Interested Vendors" at the bottom of the solicitation to be added to the interested vendors list for contact and networking. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that interested parties click on "Add to Watchlist" at the bottom of the solicitation to receive notification of additional postings related to this project.</p>

<DESC>The US Coast Guard, Rescue 21 Project Resident Office Alaska (PRO Alaska) has a requirement to purchase, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, three Windside WS-0.30A Vertical Axis Wind Turbines from Raigatta Energy, Ontario Canada.  In December, 2008, PRO Alaska posted a Request for Information on FedBizOpps (HSCG23-09-VAWT) and conducted a technology assessment to determine whether viable wind energy technology exists to supplement power requirements for remote Alaska mountaintops.  As a result of the information received and assessment of existing Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products, the Coast Guard has determined that only one COTS product exists that is designed specifically for arctic areas and has 10-15 years of history of having survived harsh climates such as the North Sea, Antarctic, Sahara Desert and the Pacific Islands.  Windside units are manufactured in Finland, are specifically designed for conditions similar to remote Alaska mountaintops, are currently operating in Antarctica and at Siberian mountaintop communications sites, and are most likely to survive the worst conditions and harshest areas of the state.

The US Geological Survey recently completed a similar analysis for VAWTs to be installed in Adak Alaska and Tristan da Cunha, South Atlantic and determined that the Windside turbines were the only product that met the governments needs for harsh arctic climates.

This notice is not a solicitation, request for competitive offers/proposals/quotations.  However, in addition to this sole source acquisition, PRO Alaska intends to issue a competitive Commercial Item Combined Synopsis/Solicitation to evaluate additional COTS vertical and/or horizontal axis wind turbines for use in milder areas of the state at mountaintop sites.  It is anticipated that solicitations will be posted no later than the end of May, 2009 under NAICS 333611 with award based on best value.  Interested vendors may download the solicitation directly from FedBizOpps.

Questions or comments regarding this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer named in this notice no later than 2:00 p.m., AST, May 8, 2009.

<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is conducting market research to determine the commercial availability and technical capability of products which could fulfill requirements for Windows Terminal Server (WTS) infrastructure in support of Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems (DoDIIS) sites.
<p>The goal of the DoDIIS Trusted Workstation (DTW) program is to allow a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) cleared user to concurrently access multiple networks (TS/SCI level and below) from a single DTW thin client workstation. Each network is presented and handled as an isolated windows-like session on the DTW thin client workstation. The DTW thin client workstation relies on WTS infrastructure to provide access to Microsoft Windows based applications (e.g. Office Automation). A given WTS suite is only allowed to operate at a single security level (i.e. single network), therefore, at least one WTS suite is required for EACH network where Windows based applications will be used.</p>
<p>Any systems identified in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be compatible with the existing system and be fully supportable even if being used with another brand of equipment. Systems identified must meet or exceed the physical, functional, and performance characteristics of the working solution described in the attachment to this document. The working solution is manufactured by Hewlett Packard and is in use as a baseline system at a central site.</p>
<p>The attached spreadsheet describes the components and system configuration (servers, power, network, storage) that comprise the existing WTS suite. One strength of the blade architecture in the WTS suite is the use of a common enclosure with shared power supplies, network and storage resources that serves to lower the overall cost of the system.<br /><br />It is requested that responses: (a) identify system components and capabilities in a manner similar to that in the attached spreadsheet, (b) include a technical description of the system in sufficient detail for the Government to make a meaningful assessment, and (c) provide any information regarding successful deployment of the system in an analogous environment.</p>
<p>Responses and questions may be submitted in writing to Charlene Booth, Contract Specialist, at charlene.booth@rl.af.mil, AFRL/RIKO, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY, 13441-4514.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Any information provided to the Government as a result of this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this Sources Sought Notice may be used as market research and in development of an acquisition strategy.</p>

Description This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HubZone 8(a), 8(a), HubZone, Small Business, Emerging Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB), and Large Business) relative to NAICS code 541380 (size standard of $5.0M). Responses to this request for information synopsis will be used by the government to make appropriate Acquisition decisions. Responses to this sources sought notice shall NEITHER constitute responses to solicitation which is not currently available NOR a request to be added to a prospective bidders list to receive a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this solicitation announcement. However, the information received will be utilized to assist in formulating the strategy for competitive procurements. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as USEPA, is seeking information from potential contractors to provide multi-media, multi-concentration dioxin/furan analytical services.  The analytical data will be used  in support of the investigation and clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). Other USEPA Program Offices, as well as customers outside the Agency, that have similar analytical data needs also use this service.
BackgroundThe dioxin/furan analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 17 2,3,7,8-substituted tetra through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which the Government will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds.
This analytical service provides data used for a variety of purposes such as: determining the nature and extent of contamination at a hazardous waste site; assessing priorities for response based on risks to human health and the environment; determining appropriate clean-up actions; and determining when remedial actions are complete. The data may be used in all stages in the investigation of hazardous waste sites, including: site inspections; Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring; remedial investigation/feasibility studies; remedial design; treat ability studies; and removal actions. In addition, this service provides data that are available for use in Superfund enforcement/litigation activities. The Contractor must be aware of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the data generated under this contract, since it is used to make major decisions regarding public health and environmental welfare.
Sources interested in this notice shall submit the following information: 1. Company name, address, point of contact, cage code, size of business pursuant to NAICS. In addition interested parties shall submit responses to the following questions: (1) is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a Small, Emergent Business, or a Small, Disadvantaged Business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under section 8(a) of the small business act? (4) Is your firm a certified "Hub Zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a Woman-Owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned and Veteran-Owned? Interested parties should also provide a list of references, capabilities and experience in conducting similar projects for the past 3 years. This is not a request for proposals or request for quotes and in no way obligates the government to award any contract. 
This notice is being used to obtain information for planning purposes and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) and on the USEPA Acquisition Management site (http://www.epa.gov). It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation and amendments, if any. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any. 
Responses to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail addressed to Rodriguez.Evia@epa.gov. All responses must be received no later than 3:30 PM. Local time on September 26, 2008. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Firms responding to this announcement, which fail to provide all of the required information, cannot be used to help the government make the acquisition decisions, which is the intent of this synopsis. This notice is to help the USEPA in determining potential sources only. No solicitation is currently available. All firms responding to this request for information notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.Set-aside code: N/APlace of performance:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, D.C. 20460USAContact: Evia Rodriguez, Contract Specialist, 202-564-0890

<SUBJECT>Create Predictive Mathematical Models on the Efficacy of Tick Control Methods for Lyme Disease Prevention

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Michigan State University, Department of Fish and Wildlife, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, to create predictive mathematical models on the efficacy of tick control methods for Lyme disease prevention.
<p>Background: Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted by the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States. A total of 248,000 cases were reported to CDC from 1992-2006. Approximately 20,000 cases are reported annually in the United States. The 2 main foci of Lyme disease in the United States are: 1) Along the northeastern Atlantic seaboard including the states of MD, DE, PA, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, NH, and ME. 2) In the north-central region, including the states of MN, WI, MI, IL, IN, IA. Although personal protection measures are the frontline against tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, few people in Lyme disease endemic areas actually practice personal protection measures on a regular basis. Therefore, effective and readily accepted methods of tick control are urgently needed to prevent Lyme disease. Researchers have developed an impressive array of control methods to attack the principal Lyme disease spirochete vector tick, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Chemical pesticides that attack ticks (acaricides) can be sprayed onto vegetation in an area-wide fashion to reduce tick populations. In addition, natural products derived from botanical sources can be sprayed to reduce ticks, as can fungal agents. Host-targeted acaricides have been developed for tick control. These can be directed at the hosts for immature ticks (rodents, shrews, birds) or the larger hosts for adult ticks (usually white-tailed deer). In addition to acaricides, vaccines or antibiotic treatments can be directed toward tick hosts to reduce Lyme disease spirochete transmission. Finally, host reduction or eradication has been tried on several coastal or island locations (usually in the form of white-tailed deer eradication) to prevent Lyme disease. Mathematical models can help public health personnel predict which interventions against vector-borne disease will have the most impact on pathogen transmission, and which interventions will be the most cost effective. Local variation in the Lyme disease spirochete transmission cycle and the importance of reservoir hosts may be an important component to include in mathematical models to predict the efficacy of Lyme disease interventions. Robust models of Lyme disease spirochete transmission dynamics and predictive models of the efficacy of intervention methods are urgently needed before large scale investments in community interventions for the prevention of Lyme disease are undertaken in Lyme disease endemic regions.</p>
<p>Purpose: To design and test mathematical models predicting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tick control methods for the prevention of Lyme disease in both the northeastern and north-central United States, where Lyme disease is hyperendemic. Life tables of all 3 stages of the vector tick I. scapularis will be developed from existing data sets on questing tick populations in the northeast and north-central U.S. Along with the life table information on tick populations, the interaction of ticks with all known vertebrate hosts and the importance of each vertebrate host in supporting the Lyme disease spirochete transmission cycle will be incorporated into the mathematical model. Based on reported of the efficacy of existing control methods in the literature, a predictive mathematical model will be fashioned, predicting the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of all existing Lyme disease prevention strategies in communities in the northeastern and north-central United States.</p>
<p>Scope of Work: The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to create predictive mathematical models on the efficacy of tick control methods for Lyme disease prevention. The vendor shall produce data sets related to the questing populations of larval, nymphal, and adult I. scapularis ticks in at least one location in the northeastern focus and one location in the north-central focus of Lyme disease spirochete transmission in the United States. The vendor shall create life table models of these tick populations. The vendor will also provide data related to the host interactions of larval, nymphal and adult I. scapularis in the northeastern and north-central foci of Lyme disease. The vendor will then create mathematical models predicting the efficacy and cost effectiveness of every known tick control method described in the literature on the prevention of Lyme disease in the northeastern and north-central United States. The vendor will also predict whether it is advantageous in a community setting to use a single tick control method for Lyme disease prevention, or to incorporate an Integrated Pest Management approach. <br />Vendor will provide monthly reports related to progress in assembling the required data sets and model development. All data will be sent to CDC/NCZVED/DVBID, Fort Collins, CO.</p>
<p>Tasks to Be Performed: The vendor shall perform the following tasks in the order shown: 1) Organize data sets on all 3 life stages (larvae, nymph, adult) of the Lyme disease spirochete vector tick, I. scapularis, based on populations from the northeastern and north-central United States. Construct life tables of I. scapularis based on questing larval, nymphal, and adult tick populations and organize the data into formats suitable for entry into simulation models for tick control and Lyme disease prevention.2) Collect data on the importance of specific vertebrate reservoir hosts for the Lyme disease spirochete in at least one location in the northeastern and one location in the north-central United States. Assign values for the relative contribution of each vertebrate host based on the actual data sets as well as data contained in the scientific literature. 3) Design simulation models predicting the efficacy of individual tick control methods and the degree of Lyme disease prevention achieved by the introduction of each control method. Design simulation models that can combine several intervention methods into an integrated pest management approach and predict the outcome of the integrated prevention methods. Include simulation models for each of the intervention methods listed: Area-wide chemical acaricides, biological control agents such as botanical products or fungal agents, rodent targeted acaricides, rodent-target vaccines and antibiotic baits, deer-targeted acaricides, deer reduction, or deer eradication. 4) Provide the life table for questing ticks, vertebrate host contribution calculations, and simulation mathematical models in the form of a written report provided to CDC. The report may be fashioned in a format suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. <br />The total period of performance shall commence upon receipt of a purchase order and shall continue for a period of 270 days. The anticipated award date is on or before June 1, 2009.</p>
<p>Deliverables are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Provide life table data on all stages of questing blacklegged ticks (larvae, nymphs, and adults) from at&nbsp; least one location in the northeastern U.S. and one location in the north-central U.S. where Lyme disease is endemic. Provide within 3 months after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>B. Provide the relative contribution of all vertebrate hosts to the Lyme disease spirochete transmission cycle in at least one location in the northeastern U.S. and at least one location in the north-central U.S. where Lyme disease is endemic. Provide within 6 months after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>C. Evaluate the life table and vertebrate host contribution data and incorporate into simulation-based mathematical models predicting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of known intervention methods for tick control and Lyme disease prevention. Provide within 9 months after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>Minimum Vendor Qualifications: The vendor must have available data sets on questing populations of all 3 stages (larvae, nymphs, and adults) of blacklegged ticks in the northeastern U.S. and north-central U.S. from areas where Lyme disease is endemic. The vendor must be familiar with the assembly of data on questing ticks into life table formats suitable for incorporation into simulation-based mathematical models. The vendor must also have available data sets on the importance of all vertebrate hosts to the Lyme disease spirochete transmission cycle in at least one location in the northeastern and north-central U.S. Finally, the vendor must be familiar with the construction of simulation-based mathematical models for the evaluation of control methods for the control of vector-borne diseases in general and tick-borne diseases in particular.</p>
<p>CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

<CONTACT>Gerald F Hooper, Phone 407-380-4266, Email gerald.f.hooper@navy.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) 

Background

Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) has a requirement for a Graphical Training Device (GTD) part task trainer, (integrated systems and procedures trainer, or virtual / integrated procedures trainer), to support the T-44C Pegasus Intermediate and Advanced Multi-engine training syllabus.  The T-44C is a Beechcraft twin engine turbo prop aircraft that has been modified for multi-engine training of US Military pilots.  The target aircraft for the GTD is the C model which has been upgraded to a glass cockpit.  The avionics suite used is the Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 series.  

The subject training device objective is to familiarize the pilot with all aircraft systems and related instruments, as well as allow for hands on practice to gain experience in the operational functions and procedures of the aircraft systems in all phases of operation.  Also desired is the ability to demonstrate all aircraft systems including related malfunctions and normal and emergency procedures.  It would allow hands-on with switches, knobs, levers, etc. that could reinforce the systems knowledge taught in the classroom portion of the systems course.  The device also requires the ability to enter data through the Control Display Unit (CDU), Flight Guidance Panel (FGP), and the Display Control Panel (DCP), resulting in the correct display indications and the proper interface with related avionics equipment such as the Remote Tuning Unit (RTU), Primary Flight Display (PFD), and the Flight Management System (FMS).  

The training sequence envisioned would have morning systems training (Mediated Interactive Lecture) followed by afternoon GTD sessions (Computer Aided Instruction) to reinforce the systems lessons and to introduce malfunctions and failures of the various systems and recovery options.  The device should be capable of utilizing  self-paced lessons that are similar to the capability of higher level computer based training modules.  These functions shall have automated and interactive modes to reinforce the training objectives.  The ability to familiarize the student with system behaviors and functions is the primary objective of this device.  It is not to be confused with higher fidelity Cockpit Procedure Trainers (CPTs) where aircraft procedures are executed and graded, but to teach the systems and what happens within the systems when levers/switches are manipulated.     

This device shall be capable of being configured in a flight mode to step through the actions and reactions of the systems due to airborne emergencies.

Actual cockpit instruments are not required, but accurate graphical depictions should be displayed on touch sensitive (where appropriate) screens.






The following modules will be taught to include components/operating limits/emergency procedures for each:

Electrical (AC/DC)
Environmental (Heating/Air conditioning/Pressurization)
Fuel System
Propellers
Power Plant and associated systems
Landing Gear
Flight Controls
Avionics (Rockwell Collins Proline 21 w/ modifications  single FMS/CDU without the Proline 21 MFD; with addition of the Goodrich Model GH-3000 ESIS, V/UHF Radio, TACAN, KMD 550/850 MFD)

Other T-44C differences as compared to KingAir 90 GTi/Proline21:
1.	Landing gear handle is on right side of dash
2.	Engine Instruments are analog (round dial) versus digital (tape) display
3.	Unique electrical system
  

Information Requested

1. Existing solutions to the subject requirement  
2. Proposed architecture of the GFT to include hardware, software, technical documentation, system drawings, physical dimensions and power requirements.
3. Challenges and risks of developing a GFT 
4.  Cost estimate for one or more of the following areas:
	i.  	Training requirements analysis to include development of a requirements traceability matrix that considers the current syllabus and improvements that could be made to the syllabus with the introduction of this device
	ii. 	Software design documentation.  Software and hardware development and procurement cost
iii.	Proposed delivery schedule
iv.	Companion instructional materials
v.	Operators manual / instructor guide  
vi.	Maintenance manual / troubleshooting guide

All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements. <br />Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA DCA200-89-H-0061 TF15. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement, EMC Hardware/Software Maintenance and Professional Services."   The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that if the maintenance is not renewed on the existing EMC equipment, and it fails, it would impact connectivity on the network and components would not be able to communicate.  As a result, databases and customer files would not be updated and credits/payments would not be updated to reflect this.  It would also impact the schedule for the upgrade and any update testing for production machines.

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure EMC Hardware/Software Maintenance and Professional Services.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Proposals are being requested based on this announcement.
This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32, effective March 31, 2009.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS Code) is 541511 (Custom Computer Programming Services), business size standard of $25.million in annual receipts. This is a 100% small business set-aside.   
BACKGROUND:  The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), recently engaged a contractor for the development and implementation of the Secure Trust Accounting Record System (STARS) that tracks work ticket documents and reconciles cash at the end of the day.  The application meets all contractual functionality but functions at an unacceptable pace.  System speeds impede workers to complete their work the same day, and to complete the daily cash balancing. 
The STARS was developed as a ColdFusion application and has experienced chronic intermittent slow processing speeds and caused delays in procession critical cash related documents.  It is suspected that the ColdFusion accesses to the database and the subsequent data population of the screens may be the major problem.   
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  OST is seeking a qualified professional company with the ability to perform an analysis of the STARS system.  This analysis will primarily focus on the ColdFusion implementation but will also analyze the effect of architecture, hardware, STIGs, drive mapping, and communications routing, and connections and will result in recommendations for ways to improve processing times to the expected standards and to eliminate or mitigate bottlenecks and slow downs.
The Government anticipates awarding a labor-hour contract with an anticipated performance period not to exceed 80 hours.  A detailed performance evaluation report shall also be required within one week of completing the analysis. 
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Contractors with the ability to provide the services outlined above must provide the following information:
	Hourly Rate	Estimated Number of Hours	Estimated Travel Costs	A qualifications statement which outlines the contractor's technical qualifications, specifically related to ColdFusion applications. This outline must also include examples of specific projects similar in nature as well as a minimum of two references for evaluation purposes.  
Award of this contract shall be based on a best value determination with technical and past performance being equal in importance and significantly more important than price.        CLAUSES:  The following provisions and clauses will apply to this procurement:
FAR 52.212-01 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS
FAR 52.212-02 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS - 1.  Technical Capability:  Experience and abilities analyzing existing programs, specifically programs using the ColdFusion application. 2.  Past Performance:  The Government may, at its discretion, base past performance on past knowledge and experience with the contractor, supply or service being provided, customer survey or other reasonable basis.  3.  Price:  Award shall be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best value to the Government, after considering technical and past performance.  In making the best value determination, the Government considers technical and past performance to be equal in importance and significantly more important than price;
FAR 52.212-03 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATION (Offeror to provide a complete copy with offer)
FAR 52.212-04 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS
FAR 52.212-05 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS
FAR 52.217-08 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is EA133M-09-RQ-0531. The synopsis/solicitation constitutes a RFQ and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires the following brand name items:</p>
<p>0001) 30 EA - Motorola HT 750 136-174 1-5W 16 CH Potable Radio <br />0002) 30 EA - Shipboard Q390 Battery Option 1800 mAh.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220. Delivery of Items 0001 and 0002 shall be by May 26, 2009 to NOAA Marine Operations Center, Attn: Robert Yates 757-441-6843, Mission Support Division, 439 West York Street, Norfolk, VA 23510.</p>
<p>The above brand name items are solicited in accordance with FAR 13.106-1, "Soliciting Competition", as such the justification required therein follows:</p>
<p>1. This justification is written to support the brand name acquisition of Motorola HT750 Portable Transceivers for the Marine Operations Center in accordance with FAR 13.106-1, "Soliciting Competition". The purchase of VHF Transceivers is for use on NOAA Ships in the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). The SCBA is an essential tool in fighting fires aboard ship and provides a vital safety feature to all firefighter personnel.</p>
<p>2. The specific radio requested is the Motorola HT750 Portable Transceiver. Included with the Purchase Request are the salient characteristics of the transceiver that distinguish its performance capacity. This capacity is essential to the function of existing SCBA's, which have been specially adapted for use with this transceiver.</p>
<p>3. The SCBA's on NOAA Ships use two different internal communication systems; the Draeger BAcomm Communication System and E-Z Radiocom Communication System. After speaking with Robert at Draeger customer service and Bob Walker at Scott Health and Safety (Manufacturer of E-Z Radiocom Communication System), they advised that both communication systems are compatible with many types of VHF handheld transceivers. Icom and Cobra were two companies mentioned that carried VHF Transceivers compatible with aforementioned communication systems. However, if one was to adapt the NOAA SCBAs to radios other than the HT750 cables would need to be changed out in the communication systems. The cost to NOAA for adapting these communication systems to different radios other than the HT750 would be between $250 or $700 per radio or $7,500 and $21,000 dollars overall.</p>
<p>4. Both above mentioned communication system manufacturers carry compatible VHF transceivers with the communication systems currently utilized within the SCBAs aboard NOAA Ships; however neither match the salient characteristics required and available on the HT750. The specifications for the Cobra Transceiver were very close (Enclosure D), but did not match the salient characteristics of the HT750. When reviewing specifications for the Icom Transceiver, it does come close but again could not meet the salient characteristics of the HRT750.</p>
<p>5. Based on the research conducted, it is hereby determined in the best interest of the Government for reasons of safety and cost to specify HT750 Transceivers to specifically ensure compatibility with existing interrelated ship safety equipment and to prevent unnecessary additional costs in adapting existing safety apparatus.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision. In accordance with 52.212-1, vendors shall include a completed copy of its representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, with its quote.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

<DESC>This modification is to address questions received during the question response time identified in the solicitation.  The following are the questions and answers:<BR><BR>Q.  The approximate frame size that was provided, is that from the outer edge of the frame to the outer edge of the frame? <BR><BR>A.  Yes, However there are some discrepancies between the frame size identified in CLIN 0002s description and the description provided in Attachment 1 for the Medal of Honor (MOH) Frame.  To clarify here are the dimensions to be utilized for the MOH frame:<BR><BR>From the left going to the right<BR>2 inches for the top mat (outer mat) on the left<BR> inch for the 2nd mat (inner Mat) on the left side of the picture<BR>8 inches for the picture with fillets<BR> inch for the 2nd mat (inner mat) on the right side of the picture<BR>1-inch margin for the top mat (outer mat) in the center<BR> inch for the 2nd mat (inner mat) on the left side of the citation<BR>8 inches for the citation with fillets<BR> inch for the 2nd mat on the right side of the citation<BR>2 inches for the right side border (margin)<BR>1/8 inch for clearance between the frame and the matting<BR>1 3/8 inches added for the frame width on the left and right<BR>23  inches (+/- 1/8 inch) is the overall width of the frame<BR><BR>From the top to the bottom:<BR>2 inches for the top mat (outer mat) at the top<BR> inch 2nd mat at the top of the picture and citation<BR>10 inches for the picture and citation with fillets<BR> inch 2nd mat at the bottom of the picture and citation<BR>2nd inches for the top mat (outer mat) at the bottom<BR>1/8 inch for clearance between the frame and the matting<BR>1 3/8 inches added for the frame width on the top and bottom<BR>16 inches is the overall high of the frame<BR><BR>Overall outer side frame dimension:  16 X 23  inches<BR><BR><BR>Q.  I am looking over the solicitation in the subject line and for both sets of frames it calls for (Black finished bust cover/backing,) should it say Black finished dust cover/backing? Black dust covers are our standard cover so that is good with us. I just need to know if we are talking about the same animal.  <BR><BR>A.  We meant DUST cover backing for both CLIN 0001 & CLIN 0002.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  In review of the description and attached pdf files, it states that there are 54 Commanding General names and 17 Commanding Sergeant Major names.  In the item description it states that they want 110 frames.  Is the breakdown 55 for CG and 55 for CSM.  Would you clarify the breakdown, so we can price materials?<BR><BR>A.  The total frames we are asking for is 110 of that particular size.  Of those 72 will be used immediately for past CGs and CSMs.  The extra frames (38) will be saved for future CGs and CSMs.  We will need the brass name plates for those so that we can engrave them at a later date.  <BR><BR><BR>Q. On the list that is posted, there are a total of 61 names, yet the description states that 90 frames will need to be hung, and 20 frames will be boxed for later use.  Are there more names coming or is the attached list incomplete? <BR><BR>A.  When we originally received the names of past CGs and CSMs from the Center for Military History, there were several names included that were not actually the CG or CSM.  Those names were then removed from the list to make it more accurate.  The list as posted is now as accurate as we can make it at present.  There should be 55 CGs and 17 CSMs for a total of 72 names.  Those pictures will be hung.  The remaining frames will be saved for future use.  They shall be boxed for storage until that time.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Who is responsible for boxing the remaining frames not hung?<BR><BR>A.  The vendor shall provide the remaining frames in boxes.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Are the 20 MOH frames to be hung in one place?<BR><BR>A.  Yes<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Are the 90 Commanding General /CSM frames  to be hung in multiple buildings, and if so how many buildings?<BR><BR>A.  All Commanding General/CSM frames will be hung in one location in one building.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  In the Medal of Honor frames, it states that the images will need to be dry mounted.  There is no additional information with names etc.  How can we find this? <BR><BR>A.  Once the contract is awarded we will provide all pictures and narratives to be mounted.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Instead of dry mounting pictures on acid free mounting board may the pictures be vac-u-mounted on acid free mounting board?<BR><BR>A.  Yes , vac-u-mounted on acid free mounting board will be acceptable.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Delivery and Installation is required within 30 days.  Does this mean that all pictures and information will be delivered to us in advance so that the deadline can be accomplished?<BR><BR>A.  Once the contract is awarded we will provide all pictures and narratives to be mounted a timely manner so that the deadline can be met. <BR><BR><BR>Q.  The glass calls for 100% UV protected reflection control glass, the % of UV protection for all conservation glass ranges between 97/98% UV.  I just want to make sure that this is clarified. <BR><BR>A.  All glass will have minimum UV blocking level of 97 percent for the range of 300 to 380 nm.  Thanks you for the clarification.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  Can the contractor have the option of using 100% UV filtered reflective control plexi-glass??  This will help us in being able to ensure safer shipping as well as making the frames more light-weight and durable? <BR><BR>A.  We will not accept Plexi-glass as a substitute.<BR><BR><BR>Q.  The frames call for WallBuddies hardware.  We recently completed a large Air Force contract at the Air and Space Command in Colorado Springs.  They ultimately changed the hardware request to security hardware so that frames could not be moved.  This comment is just to throw out a reminder that this hardware is available at about the same cost.  <BR><BR>A.  The RFQ calls for a brand name or equal offer.  Therefore, Or equivalent offers are acceptable for submission.  <BR><BR><BR>Q.  Can you read pdf files?<BR><BR>A.  Yes<BR> <BR><BR>This ends the question and answer period for the solicitation.  Acknowledgement of this modification is required with your quote submission.

As RFID is considered the industry best-practice in improving the efficiency of inventory tracking and management, DSD is looking to begin the second phase of RFID implementation for the IRM Consolidated Bureaus.The request for product and services includes: (i) RFID Metal Mount Tags  OMNI ID Flex tags; (ii) HHR (scanner) application conversion; and (iii) RFID Professional Training and Support.41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.  This justification is for continuation of previous years services and tags garnered through the same contractor. This would be a Phase 2 implementation, and as DSD is slated to begin with in-scope IT Asset consolidation immediately post the March 15, 2009 DoS reconciliation deadline, we are in an urgent situation and imminent to fall-behind with the IT Consolidation schedule. Thus, the ability to continue with an industry-recognized contractor that has already helped us implement the first phase seems to be the best and most efficient avenue to pursue. Lastly, their quote was vastly less than other competitors we contacted.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY:  PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE ROBERT SMITH VANCE FEDERAL BUILDING AND COURTHOUSE IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, SOLICITATION NO. GS-04P-09-EX-C-0077.  The Real Estate, Design and Construction Organization in the Southeast Sunbelt Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  This project is funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  The type of contract is the Construction Manager as-constructor Guaranteed Maximum Price with Construction Contingency Allowance (herein referred to as CMc).  A CMc provides Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  GSA intends to contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for a major renovation of the Robert Smith Vance Federal Building and Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to GSA.  Design Phase Services is expected to commence upon award of the contract on or about August 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be awarded on or about March 2010, with a performance period of approximately 900 calendar days.
The existing structure was built in 1921, and is listed on the National Register for Historical Places.  It is a four-story building of approximately 173,993-square-feet.  The two primary tenants of the building are the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama and the federal probation department.  The mission of this scope of work is to support client agencies by housing federal tenants in adjoining spaces within the building to support and maximize efficiencies; and to ensure the viability of the historic structure by identifying major deficiencies.  The guaranteed maximum price for this scope of work is $32,000,000, for combined Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  
Design has not started on this project.  It is anticipated that this CMc contract and the contract for architectural and engineering will be awarded in the same timeframe.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract:  Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented during the procurement process.  At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request that the CMc provide a proposal for the Construction Phase Work.    
&ldquo;Design Phase Services&rdquo; means the design phase construction management services, constructability reviews, cost estimate reconciliation services and other related services as described in the scope of work provided in the RFP.
&ldquo;Construction Phase Work&rdquo; means all work and services, including general conditions, necessary for the construction of the project described by the plans, specifications and other provisions incorporated into the RFP, excluding Design Phase Services.  Renovation of the existing building will occur while the building is occupied.  GSA intends for the work to be accomplished in multiple phases, and anticipates construction to begin before design is complete.
The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA&rsquo;s Construction Manager as-agent; GSA&rsquo;s selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA&rsquo;s building commissioning firm; GSA&rsquo;s security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.
A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price.  This is a multi-step advisory procurement that consists of two stages.  In Stage I, Pre-Solicitation Notice, interested Offerors must provide a statement from their federally approved bonding corporate surety (see website at http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html), certifying their bonding capacity for a project with a Guaranteed Maximum Price of $32,000,000.  Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternate to evidence of corporate bonding capacity.  Offerors are required to be licensed general contractors in accordance with State of Alabama statutes.  Offerors responding to Stage I must also submit information in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  Submissions shall clearly address the Stage I rating factors identified in this announcement.  Proposals will be evaluated using an Advisory Multi-step Process as specified in FAR 15.202.  The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All Offerors shall be informed that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may still compete in Stage II. 
Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and four (4) copies of the required technical information.  The submission should be in an 8-1/2&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed below.  Standard Form 330 may be utilized, but is not required.  The total pre-solicitation notice submission should not exceed 10 one-sided  8-1/2&rdquo;x 11&rdquo; pages or 5 double-sided 8-1/2&rdquo;x 11&rdquo; pages (not including Table of Contents or Section Separators), with one-inch margins, and in a font not less than 12-point in size.  Font style is optional.  
Description:  These factors consider the Offeror successfully completing similar projects.  &ldquo;Similar&rdquo; is defined as renovation or modernization of multi-story (3-story minimum) buildings of a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet.  These structures can include courthouses, hospital facilities, casinos, Class A office space, research laboratories, government-owned buildings, or major renovations of such similar projects, with a construction cost of a minimum of $25 million.  The SSEB will be limited to reviewing only projects of similarity.  Relate all projects submitted in Factors 1 and 2 in type and scope to this project.
Factor 1: Design Phase Services on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate at least one (1) project completed within the past ten (10) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Design Phase Services similar to those required under this project.  
Factor 2: Construction Phase Work as a prime contractor on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate experience on at least three (3) projects completed within the past ten (10) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Construction Phase Work similar to those required under this project.  
Projects proposed under Factor 1 and Factor 2 may be the same.  The Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice factors are independent of the factors in the Stage II Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate an Offeror&rsquo;s viability based on its submissions to the Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Offerors will be notified of viability and the Request for Proposal will be released on or about May 15, 2009.  
Stage II Request for Proposals (RFP).  Proposals will be evaluated and scored according to technical evaluation factors included in the RFP.   The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of price proposals.  As part of the Stage II evaluation, the Contracting Officer and Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may conduct interviews.  However, GSA reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions or oral presentations (clarifications may be made as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  Final selection will be made based on technical factors being weighted significantly more than price (price being represented by the Offeror&rsquo;s proposal for Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work).  The Offerors may use projects submitted in Stage I to respond to the Stage II evaluation factors.  If interviews are conducted, firms will be interviewed at GSA&rsquo;s Region 4 offices in Atlanta, Georgia, by members of the SSEB.  The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA&rsquo;s Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating Stage II proposals.  Factor 1 considers past performance in providing Design Phase Services on similar projects.  Factor 2 considers past performance in providing Construction Phase Services as a prime contractor on similar projects.  Factor 3 considers qualifications and experience of key personnel.  Factor 4 considers the management plan and technical approach.  Factor 5 considers the Offeror&rsquo;s proposed approach for successful and meaningful participation and performance during Design Phase Services.   Factor 6 considers the Offeror&rsquo;s available resources and facilities to accomplish the project. Stage II also requires Offerors that are large businesses to indicate their intention to submit a subcontracting plan for this project that provides for participation by small business concerns.  Stage II proposals will be due on or about June 15, 2009.
Interested firms must send their Stage I submission, no later than 2:00 PM EST on Monday, May 11, 2009, to Valerie Riecke Smith, PhD, DBIA, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Acquisition Management Division (4PG), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree Street N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, 30308.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is anticipated on or about May 28, 2009, in Birmingham, Alabama, and will be established and published in the Request for Proposals in Stage II.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-09-EX-C-0077) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).   Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed.  Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.</p>

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective March 19, 2009. The requirement will be Set Aside for Small Business if two (2) or more qualified Small Businesses submit quotes. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325120, which has a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees and shall remain open for responsible sources to respond. Contractors are required to identify their companys business size.  TSA plans to establish a single no cost BPA to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) award will be three (3) years in duration with a not to exceed ceiling amount of $130,000.00.  The firm fixed price will be determined based on a breakdown of all costs and delivery to Atlantic City, NJ.  The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized purchases made under the BPA. 

BACKGROUND

The Helium and Nitrogen gases are used to operate the DART system which is located in the Canine Explosives Branchs chemistry laboratory.  The DART is a Mass Spectrometer system that is used to analyze trace amounts of substances.  The DART cannot operate without these two gases.  The gas cylinders must be 9 (diameter) x 56 (height) because the cage and hookups for these gases were specifically configured to fit this cylinder size. The Helium gas purity grade MUST be UHP Plus 99.999%.  The Nitrogen gas purity MUST be Ultra Hi Purity 99.999%.  These purity grades must be used to eliminate interference with unknown samples and to reduce contamination.  The contractor is required to deliver the specified amount of gas cylinders required and pick up the empty gas cylinders that have been consumed. The amount of gases consumed per month depends on how frequently the DART is used by the chemist. 

II. CONTRACT LINE ITEM STRUCTURE:  The resultant contract award will contain two (2) contract line item number (CLINs) per year for a total of six (6) CLINS.

If either electronic mail or facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail.

Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (e) of this clause.

	Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item, 
	Warranty considerations, 
	Maintenance, and 
	Environmental and energy efficiency considerations. 

PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:     Past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Governments confidence in the Offerors ability to successfully deliver the product proposed. 

Offerors shall provide a list of not more than five (5) projects/contracts/orders where the offeror has successfully contracted for similar requirements in the past two (2) years. These projects/contracts/orders can include those performed for the federal, state, and local governments, commercial industry and those performed for private organizations.  For each project/ contract/order that meets this description, the offeror shall provide the following information:

SOURCE SELECTION:  The Government intends to award a competitive Blanket Purchase Agreement to the Contractor whose proposal, conforming to the combined/synopsis, represents the best value solution using a Trade-Off analysis. The Best Value Approach is a method of selecting the proposal that presents the best value to the Government, based on evaluation of each offer in the areas of Technical Narrative, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) may determine that a superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The SSA, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposals relative capability.

The Government may: 
(1) Reject any or all submittals if such action is in the public interest; 
(2) Accept other than the lowest price submittal; and, 
(3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 

Proposals that do not respond to all requirements in the solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be significantly not compliant with the solicitation requirements, unrealistically high or low in price, or reflects a failure to comprehend the requirement. 

The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors. If the government determines that discussions are necessary, the government reserves the right to establish a competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306(c). The government reserves the right to limit the competitive range for efficiency.

<p>As the C-130 ATS program continues to work toward the 1 March 2010 award date, several concerns have come to light. One of the concerns highlighted by our continued exchanges with industry is the lack of slippage time in the source selection process. Several industry partners voiced concerns over the short time frame to award and concerns over the impact to the war fighter have also been discussed between industry and the C-130 team. As a result, the C-130 ATS program is contemplating a 6-month bridge contract that may be awardable if the schedule of the on-going source selection begins to slip.</p>
<p>The C-130 ATS program team intends to aggressively pursue the current schedule with an award date of 1 March 2010. However, in the event of substantial slippage in the contract award schedule the team would like to engage with industry as to whether or not there is any industry interest in a 6-month bridge contract. This 6-month bridge contract would be competed. This contract would not be part of the ongoing source selection effort, but rather a short term fix for a potential problem.</p>
<p><strong>If you have interest in competing for such a contract, please contact the PCO Joshua Burton at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joshua.Burton@hill.af.mil</span> no later than COB Friday, 1 May 2009.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>a. The Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to host an Industry Day for a potential acquisition of the Transformational Satellite Communication System (TSAT) Block 10 Development and Production on Friday, 16 Jan 09. The purpose of Industry Day is to present a TSAT Block 10 concept, discuss Block 10 issues, and participate in one-on-one question and answer sessions with potential offerors. The morning session will include a program overview for Block 10 to include a potential acquisition strategy and draft solicitation highlights, followed by one-on-one sessions in the afternoon with interested potential prime contractors and their subcontractors/teammates. The morning session will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-1 Conference Hall, Room 1062, 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245 starting at 0800 hrs (8:00 A.M.) PST. Information on the times for the one-on-one afternoon sessions will be provided directly to the requester in accordance with the below scheduling instructions.</p>
<p>
<p>b. The draft solicitation and all available supporting documentation will be available for review on the TSAT Bidders Library starting Tuesday, 23 Dec 08 at 1700 hrs (5:00 P.M.) PST. See below for instructions on how to access the Bidders Library.</p>
<p>c. As seating is limited, registration is required for attendance. The number of attendees per company is limited to eight (8). Small Businesses are encouraged to participate. The applicable size standard for this requirement is 1,000 employees. NAICS information is available for review at: http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf. Potential subcontractors may attend the one-on-one session with their associated potential prime, if said sessions are scheduled. If potential subcontractors attend the one-on-one session, the contractor attendees for the one-on-one session will be increased to twelve (12) participants. Potential offeror(s) can register for the conference and schedule an appointment for a one-on-one session by contacting Lt Joseph Kim at joseph.kim@losangeles.af.mil, or Lt Rick Paz at jose.paz@losangeles.af.mil, (310) 653-9406. The one-on-one session must be scheduled by 1700 (5:00 P.M.), PST on Wednesday, 7 Jan 09. Interested contractors may submit questions for the one-on-one session and all draft RFP documents no later than 1200 hrs (12:00 P.M.) PST on Friday, 9 Jan 09 via e-mail by attaching the form titled "RFP Comments for Bidder's Library" located on the Bidders Library to Mr. Charles Briggs and Ms. Yvette Wilson. All Visitor Clearances should be faxed to the Visitor Control fax at (310) 653-9554 or submitted via SMO Code "MCS WING". Requests should specify "Attn: Lt Joseph Kim, TSAT Space Industry Day" and contain the following:</p>
<p>(1) Name;<br />(2) Social Security Number (SSAN);<br />(3) Date of Birth (DOB);<br />(4) Place of Birth (POB);<br />(5) Citizenship;<br />(6) Clearance Level;<br />(7) Clearance Investigation Date;<br />(8) Clearance Granting Agency;<br />(9) Member's Company-Organization;<br />(10) Meeting Subject;<br />(11) Meeting Location;<br />(12) Visit Dates;<br />(13) MCSW Sponsor and Cage Code (for industry).</p>
<p>All meetings will be held at DoD Secret level.</p>
<p>d. The Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) will provide DoD with high data rate Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) and Internet-like services as defined in the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA). TSAT is essential to global net-centric operations. As the spaceborne element of the Global Information Grid (GIG), it will extend the GIG to users without terrestrial connections, providing improved connectivity and data transfer capability, vastly improving satellite communications for the warfighter. TSAT's Internet Protocol (IP) routing will connect thousands of users through networks rather than limited point-to-point connections.</p>
<p>e. The scope of this acquisition will be for the development and production of TSAT Block 10 Space Vehicles (SVs), and the ground command and control element. The space vehicle would be designed in a manner providing graceful growth and modularity, so in a potential, future follow-on TSAT program, capabilities could be scaled to achieve increased requirements.</p>
<p>f. After Industry Day, in order for the Government to ascertain potential offerors' understanding and capability to successfully execute this program, all interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 1700 hrs (5:00 P.M.) PST on Friday, 23 Jan 09, demonstrating an understanding of the baseline Block 10 TSAT requirements. The SOC should include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) Detailed understanding of the TSAT requirements;<br />(2) Capability to assist the Government in maturing, defining, and refining requirements;<br />(3) Ability to conduct quick-turn engineering trades and analysis;<br />(4) Implementation of System Engineering Tools (DOORS, etc);<br />(5) Robust Earned Value Management Reporting Capability (Tools, Processes, etc);<br />(6) Any relevant space communications, integration, and/or engineering experience; <br />(7) Staffing / resource allocation plan indicating that you have the resources available to meet the Government's requirements on a timely and cost-effective basis;<br />(8) Capability to develop, integrate, test and manufacture the Block 10 SVs for an Initial Launch Capability (ILC) of 2nd Quarter FY 2019;<br />(9) Capability to grow the Block 10 spacecraft and system in a graceful manner to field subsequent blocks of vehicles with capability up to and including that specified as threshold capability for the original TSAT Block 2 system.</p>
<p>Further instructions on the SOC requirements and delivery instructions will be provided at Industry Day.</p>
<p>g. The draft RFP and all future announcements, updates, and unclassified information for this proposed acquisition will be available exclusively on the TSAT Bidders Library. Other unclassified and non-proprietary documents will also be available through the Bidders Library as they become available. No further announcements are anticipated to be made on Fed Biz Ops prior to announcement of a final RFP release. Potential offerors are responsible for staying abreast of the contents posted on Bidders Library. Contractors may request access to the Bidders Library by contacting Lt Joseph Kim at joseph.kim@losangeles.af.mil, or Lt Rick Paz at jose.paz@losangeles.af.mil, (310) 653-9406, and must agree to sign a Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to accessing the Bidders Library. The required Non-disclosure Agreement form can be acquired by emailing Lt Joseph Kim or Lt Rick Paz. Requests for classified documents will be submitted to SMC/MCSG (Space Segment), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lt Joseph Kim. Since access to classified and critical technologies will be required for this effort, we expect that foreign firms will be authorized only for non-restricted portions of the acquisition.</p>
<p>h. This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.</p>

If, after reading the requirements listed in this synopsis, a company cannot meet all of the requirements at this time, you are highly encouraged to: 1) register your firm on the interested vendors list for this solicitation at this www.fbo.gov website, and 2)  submit a capabilities package to the DeCA contracting office describing the work your company is capable of providing, even if your firm cannot at this time meet all of the requirements exactly as stated below. This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation or additional information available at this time. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition (FAR) Part 10.  

This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small business HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN (SDV), or SMALL DISADVANTAGED (SD) sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to two (2) military commissary store locations, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) and Dugway Proving Grounds(PG),Utah, assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).


DeCAs military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCAs commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns who qualify as HUB Zone (certified or non-certified), (SDV), and (SD)who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to Hill AFB and Dugway PG.  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from the two commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCAs existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractors own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.  

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Distribution is a key factor in a successful FF&V program. A successful distribution system relies on two main factors, a large volume of product movement and a sufficient number of well-placed distribution centers. When these two factors are present, customers will receive the freshest products available.  Each consolidation and/or distribution center utilized by the contractor in performance of the resulting contract shall have multiple temperature-controlled areas in order to meet the different recommended temperature requirements for the various products in order to maintain shelf life and ensure the FF&V received at each location is of the freshest and highest quality. The lead-time from order placement to product receipt at the store level for CONUS locations (Continental USA) will not exceed 24 hours.

USDA INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
Contractors will be required to work with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to ensure that all products are inspected, received, stored, staged, and shipped in accordance with USDA standards.  

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

Contractors will be required to provide additional support and promotions to both Hill AFB and Dugway PG.  Additional support includes point of sale material, recipe cards, pamphlets, coupons, seasonal dcor, and/or other material that is often available from produce commissions.  Additional support also includes value added services that are designed to enhance the overall produce program and increase customer satisfaction through a well-merchandised produce department.  Further, additional support includes weekly merchandising visits to each commissary store location, and periodic merchandising support during promotions, resets, and/or grand opening events that provide show-stopping merchandising techniques and SUPER sale priced items.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

Interested sources are required to respond to this sources sought synopsis by submitting a capabilities package to the contracting office NOT LATER THAN MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009.  The capabilities package should include:
(1)  Business Size:  HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified), (SDV) and (SD).

(2)  Abilities Statement: a short statement regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this proposed procurement. 
 
(3)  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material.

(4)  Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.  Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, business reference point of contact and phone number.

Responses to this sources sought synopsis shall be mailed to the following address:  Defense Commissary Agency, ATTN: PSCP/ Cecilia Copeland, 1300 E. Ave., Fort Lee, VA 23801-1800.  Responses must be received no later than 4:30 pm Eastern Time on MAY 11, 2009.  Electronic submission will be accepted and should be emailed to cecilia.copeland@deca.mil.

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS inventive advances
in scientific and technological fields frequently result from governmental
activities carried on by Government employees; and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS the Government of
the United States
is expending large sums of money annually for the conduct of these activities;
and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS these advances
constitute a vast national resource; and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS it is fitting and
proper that the inventive product of functions of the Government, carried out

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS the rights of Government
employees in their inventions should be recognized in appropriate instances;
and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREAS the carrying out of
the policy of this order requires appropriate administrative arrangements:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, and as President
of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United
States, in the interest of the establishment and operation of a uniform patent
policy for the Government with respect to inventions made by Government
employees, it is hereby ordered as follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The following basic
policy is established for all Government agencies with respect to inventions
hereafter made by any Government employee:<br /> (a) The Government shall obtain the entire right, title and interest in and to
all inventions made by any Government employee (1) during working hours, or (2)
with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials,
funds, or information, or of time or services of other Government employees on
official duty, or (3) which bear a direct relation to or are made in
consequence of the official duties of the inventor.<br /> (b) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any
one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) last above, to the
invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to
the Government of the entire right, title and interest to such invention, or in
any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain
entire right, title and interest therein (although the Government could obtain
some under paragraph (a), above), the Government agency concerned, subject to
the approval of the Chairman of the Government Patents Board (provided for in
paragraph 3 of this order and hereinafter referred to as the Chairman), shall
leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the
reservation to the Government of a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free
license in the invention with power to grant licenses for all governmental
purposes, such reservation, in the terms thereof, to appear, where practicable,
in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.<br /> (c) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), above, to the facts
and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall
be presumed that an invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned
(i) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or
composition of matter, (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work,
or both, (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed
or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv) to act in a liaison
capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged
in such work, or made by an employee included within any other category of
employees specified by regulations issued pursuant to section 4(b) hereof,
falls within the provisions of paragraph (a), above, and it shall be presumed that
any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of
paragraph (b), above. Either presumption may be rebutted by the facts or
circumstances attendant upon the conditions under which any particular
invention is made and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall not preclude a
determination that the invention falls within the provisions of paragraph (d)
next below.<br /> (d) In any case wherein the Government neither (1) pursuant to the provisions
of paragraph (a) above, obtains entire right, title and interest in and to an
invention nor (2) pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) above, reserves a
non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to
grant licenses for all governmental purposes, the Government shall leave the
entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the Government
employee, subject to law.<br /> (e) Actions taken, and rights acquired, under the foregoing provisions of this
section, shall be reported to the Chairman in accordance with procedures
established by him.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Subject to considerations
of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, the following basic
policy is established for the collection, and dissemination to the public, of
information concerning inventions resulting from Government research and
development activities:<br /> (a) When an invention is made under circumstances defined in paragraph 1(a) of
this order giving the United States the right to title thereto, the Government
agency concerned shall either prepare and file an application for patent
therefore in the United States Patent Office or make a full disclosure of the
invention promptly to the Chairman, who may, if he determines the Government
interest so requires, cause application for patent to be filed or cause the
invention to be fully disclosed by publication thereof: <em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;">Provided, however, </span></em>That,
consistent with present practice of the Department of Agriculture, no
application for patent shall, without the approval of the Secretary of
Agriculture, be filed in respect of any variety of plant invented by any
employee of that Department.<br /> (b) [Revoked]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[Sec. 2(b) revoked by EO
10695 of Jan. 16, 1957, 22 FR 365, 3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 355]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. (a) [Revoked]<br /> (b) The Government Patents Board shall advise and confer with the Chairman
concerning the operation of those aspects of the Government's patent policy
which are affected by the provisions of this order or of Executive Order No.
9865, and suggest modifications or improvements where necessary.<br /> (c) [Revoked]<br /> (d) The Chairman shall establish such committees and other working groups as
may be required to advise or assist him in the performance of any of his
functions.<br /> (e) The Chairman of the Government Patents Board and the Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development<sup><a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10096.html#1#1">1</a></sup> (provided for by Executive Order No. 9912 of December 24, 1947) shall establish
and maintain such mutual consultation as will effect the proper coordination of
affairs of common concern.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[Sec. 3 amended by EO 10930
of Mar. 24, 1961, 26 FR 2583, 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 456]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. With a view to obtaining
uniform application of the policies set out in this order and uniform
operations there under, the Chairman is authorized and directed:<br /> (a) To consult and advise with Government agencies concerning the application
and operation of the policies outlined herein;<br /> (b) After consultation with the Government Patents Board, to formulate and
submit to the President for approval such proposed rules and regulations as may
be necessary or desirable to implement and effectuate the aforesaid policies,
together with the recommendations of the Government Patents Board thereon;<br /> (c) To submit annually a report to the President concerning the operation of
such policies, and from time to time such recommendations for modification
thereof as may be deemed desirable;<br /> (d) To determine with finality any controversies or disputes between any Government
agency and its employees, to the extent submitted by any party to the dispute,
concerning the ownership of inventions made by such employees or rights
therein; and<br /> (e) To perform such other or further functions or duties as may from time to
time be prescribed by the President or by statute.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. The functions and duties
of the Secretary of Commerce and the Department of Commerce under the
provisions of Executive Order No. 9865 of June 14, 1947 are hereby transferred
to the Chairman and the whole or any part of such functions and duties may be
delegated by him to any Government agency or officer: <em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;">Provided, </span></em>That said
Executive Order No. 9865 shall not be deemed to be amended or affected by any
provision of this Executive order other than this paragraph 5.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Each Government agency
shall take all steps appropriate to effectuate this order, including the
promulgation of necessary regulations which shall not be inconsistent with this
order or with regulations issued pursuant to paragraph 4 (b) hereof.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. As used in this Executive
order, the next stated terms, in singular and plural, are defined as follows
for the purposes hereof:<br /> (a) "Government agency" includes any executive department and any
independent commission, board, office, agency, authority, or other

Posted on Web: YesSynopsis or Description
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS BEING ADVERTISED AS AN 8(a) COMPETITIVE, DESIGN BUILD SOLICITATION.
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO AWARD A FIRM-FIXED PRICE CONTRACT UNDER SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL N44255-09-R-7003, P-236, ARRA - REPLACE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT NAVAL AIR STATION WHIDBEY ISLAND, WA. The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 237110. The size standard is $33,500,000.00.  The Federal Supply Code is Y299.
Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Region X which includes the states Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside the states of Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon but having a Bona fide branch office in the states of Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon. A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary. The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.  The SBA has assigned the number 1013-09-903933 for tracking purposes of this contract requirement.
DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Project will replace asbestos cement water distribution lines on Ault Field, Seaplane Base and provides lines connecting the two bases with new ductile iron water lines up to 18 inches in diameter.  The water lines outside of Government Property will run on City of Oak Harbor and Island County property via franchise agreements or easements.  Existing lines will be plugged and abandoned in place except where limited removal is required to accommodate new line connections.  Project will be a design build construction contract.  The design phase will require a detailed design (plans, specs, engineering analysis, etc.) for the water line replacement.  Design will also be required to coordinate with Navy plus the City and County agencies regarding work on their property.  Design will be required to minimize outage while constructing near the existing asbestos cement water lines and some old cast iron lines which are fragile.  Design will require ultrasonic f! ield survey for underground obstructions before excavation plus a flow analysis to model performance and validate the proposed new water main sizes.  Most of the pipeline areas are within developed Base or City areas so traffic control will be involved.  Surface restoration required will often be roadway along with some sidewalks or turf.
AWARD INFORMATION: The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the "best value" to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on:  Factor I:  Relevant Experience, Factor II:  Past Performance and Safety, Factor III: Scheduling and Logistics Plan, and Factor IV:  Price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government; to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALU! ATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  
The solicitation for phase one will be available for viewing and downloading at https://www.neco.navy.mil, upon issuance.  Prospective Offerors must and should immediately register themselves on the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the web site.  This will normally be the only method of amendment distribution; therefore, it is the OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.  Offeror's must also be registered in the Contractors Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement at http://www.ccr2000.com.  
All inquiries should be submitted to Mr. Gabe D. Perez (360) 396-1861 or via email gabe.d.perez@navy.mil.

<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>Providers of this technical assistance should have familiarity with the network management approaches and technology used in both the large scale fixed networks operated by DISA and the military Services as well as major tactical programs such as Army WIN-T, Navy ADNS, and TSAT as well as an understanding of the state of the practice in network management and related current and emerging technical standards. Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum 6 page statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>This task order will require engaging with participating organizations from the Selected Network Program Consortium (SNPC) and the GIG Network Management Working Group to conduct the following tasks:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Work with the GIG Network Management WG and tactical programs to identify and document the warfighter needs and scenarios for cross domain NetOps functions of GIG Enterprise Management (GEM) and GIG Network Defense (GND) in the GIG.<br />&bull; Document, to the extent that time and resources allow, selected current or proposed strategic/tactical network management implementation approaches from different GIG programs.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY: PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE GEORGE C. YOUNG COURTHOUSE AND FEDERAL BUILDING IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA
<SOLNBR>GS-04P-09-EX-C-0078
<RESPDATE>051109

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE GEORGE C. YOUNG COURTHOUSE AND FEDERAL BUILDING, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, SOLICITATION NO. GS-04P-09-EX-C-0078. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis. The Real Estate, Design and Construction Organization in the Southeast Sunbelt Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project. This project is funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA.) The project delivery method being used is the Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc). The contract type is Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). A Construction Manager as-Constructor provides Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work. GSA intends to contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for a major modernization of the George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building in Orlando, Florida, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to the Government. Design Phase Services are expected to commence upon award of the contract on or about August 2009. The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be exercised on or about March 2010 with an anticipated performance period of 1095 calendar days. The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process. At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request the CMc to provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work. The George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building contains 188,588 gross square feet and is 6 stories tall. The building has no interior parking, as that was lost due to the tunnel connector to the new attached Annex. There is a 100+ parking structure on site built as part of the Annex project. The George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building currently houses the U.S. District Court, Magistrate Court, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Attorney, Social Security, GSA-PBS, GSA-FSS, FBI, DHS-FPS, Probation and Public Defender. The George C. Young Courthouse and Federal Building is located at 401 W Central Blvd, Orlando, FL 32801. The guaranteed maximum price for this project is $35,000,000 million for combined services (Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.). The North American Industry Classification System Code(s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-Step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. Design has not started on this project. It is anticipated that this CMc contract and the contract for architectural and engineering will be awarded in the same timeframe. There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work. The Construction Phase Work is an option. The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented during the procurement process. At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request that the CMc provide a proposal for the Construction Phase Work. &ldquo;Design Phase Services&rdquo; means the design phase construction management services, constructability reviews, cost estimate reconciliation services and other related services as described in the scope of work provided in the RFP. &ldquo;Construction Phase Work&rdquo; means all work and services, including general conditions, necessary for the construction of the project described by the plans, specifications and other provisions incorporated into the RFP, excluding Design Phase Services. Renovation of the existing building will occur while the building is occupied. GSA intends for the work to be accomplished in multiple phases, and anticipates construction to begin before design is complete. The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA&rsquo;s Construction Manager as-Agent; GSA&rsquo;s selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA&rsquo;s building commissioning firm; GSA&rsquo;s security consultant, and other consultants. The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, but not limited to, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein. A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. This is a multi-step advisory procurement that consists of two stages. In Stage I, Pre-Solicitation Notice, Offerors must provide a statement from their federal approved bonding corporate surety (see website at /www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html), certifying their bonding capacity for a project GMP of $35,000,000 and are required to be licensed general contractors in accordance with state statutes. Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternate to evidence of corporate bonding capacity. Submissions shall clearly address the Stage I factors identified in this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated using an Advisory Multi-step Process as specified in FAR 15.202. The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. All Offerors shall be informed that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may still compete in Stage II. Stage I Factors Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and five (5) copies of the required technical information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed below. The total pre-solicitation notice submission should not exceed ten (10) one-sided 8-1/2&rdquo;x 11&rdquo; pages or five (5) double-sided 8-1/2&rdquo;x 11&rdquo; pages (not including Table of Contents or Section Separators), with one-inch margins, and in a font not less than 12-point in size. Font style is optional. These factors consider Offeror in successfully completing similar projects. &ldquo;Similar&rdquo; is defined as renovation or modernization of multi-story (4-story minimum) buildings of a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet. These structures can include courthouses, hospital facilities, casinos, Class A office space, research laboratories, government-owned buildings, or major renovations of such similar projects, with a construction cost of a minimum of $25 million. The SSEB will be limited to reviewing only projects of similarity for purposes of experience. Relate all projects in type and scope to this project. Factor 1: Design Phase Services. As prime contractor completed at least three (3) project(s), within the past ten (10) years of $25 million or more in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Design Phase Services similar to those required under this project. Please provide the name, location and date completed of referenced projects. Factor 2: Construction Phase Services. As a prime contractor completed at least three (3) projects, within the past ten (10) years of $25 million or more in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000 gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided construction phase work similar to those required under this project. Please provide the name and location of referenced projects. Projects presented under Factors 1 and 2 above may be the same projects. The Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice factors are independent of the factors in the Stage II Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate an Offeror&rsquo;s viability based on its submission to the Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice. Stage II Request for Proposals (RFP) - Proposals will be evaluated and scored according to technical evaluation factors included in the RFP. The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of price proposals. As part of the Stage II evaluation, the Contracting Officer and Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may conduct interviews. However, the Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions or oral presentations (clarifications may be made as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms. Final selection will be made based on technical factors being weighted significantly more than price (price being represented by the Offeror&rsquo;s proposal for Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services). The Offerors may use projects submitted in Stage I to respond to the Stage II evaluation factors. If interviews are conducted, firms will be interviewed at GSA&rsquo;s Region 4 offices in Atlanta, Georgia, by members of the SSEB. The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA&rsquo;s Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating Stage II proposals. Factor 1 considers past performance in providing Design Phase Services on similar projects. Factor 2 considers past performance in providing Construction Phase Services as a prime contractor on similar projects. Factor 3 considers qualifications and experience of key personnel. Factor 4 considers the management plan and technical approach. Factor 5 considers the offeror&rsquo;s proposed approach for successful and meaningful participation and performance during Design Phase Services. Factor 6 considers the offeror&rsquo;s available resources and facilities to accomplish the project. Stage II also requires offerors that are a large business to indicate their intention to submit a subcontracting plan for the project that provides for participation by small business concerns. Interested firms must submit their Stage I submission, no later than 2:00 PM EST on Monday, May 11, 2009, to Lawrence Hales, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Acquisition Management Division (4PG), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree Street N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, 30308. A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is scheduled to be held on May 21, 2009 at 10:30 am. All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-09-EX-C-0078) on the face of the envelope. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed. Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration. Please direct questions to: Lawrence Hales (404) 224-2314 or email Lawrence.hales@gsa.gov</p>

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES  

The purpose of these instructions is to provide guidance for the preparation and submission of proposals and to establish specific content of each proposal to assure its completeness and suitability for evaluation purposes.

I.	Organizational Conflicts of Interest:

1. As defined in Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, an organizational conflict of interest exists when the nature of the work to be performed under a proposed Government contract may, without some restriction on future activities (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the 	contractor or (2) impair the contractors objectivity in performing the contract work.

2. The CM will be significantly involved in development of the project scope of work, design review, procurement phase services, managing and inspecting construction and providing related technical support services.  Therefore, an award to the CM of a contract for A/E services, construction services or consultant services for this project would result in a significant potential conflict of interest.

3. Accordingly, the successful CM contractor, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A/E services, construction services or consultant services for this project, nor shall the CM be a subcontractor or a consultant for this project.

Program Launch Date is July 1, 2009, which is the date of the Notice to Proceed.   2.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: a. General Intention - The VISN 4 Healthcare System has a requirement for a Contractor to provide telephonic smoking cessation counseling services as described herein to veteran beneficiaries.  The VA will provide pharmacotherapy to veterans enrolled as participants in this program. The telephonic smoking cessation program shall be fully operational no later than six (6) weeks from date of award of this contract.  The program launch date shall be mutually agreeable to both parties, and term of contract shall be one year from issuance of Notice to Proceed.  Notice to Proceed will be issued BY THE Contracting Officer on agreed upon program launch date.  b. The Contractor will provide up to six (6) outbound telephone interventions, and one additional end-of-program data collection call per participant enrolled in the program.

Enrollment is anticipated to be approximately 6000 veteran participants by the end of the twelve-month contract period beginning no later than two (2) months from the date of award of this contract.  Veterans will be referred through entry of electronic consults to this program via VA nursing staff and providers and self-referrals who are enrolled in VISTA. Self referrals are eligible veterans who have a need to join the smoking cessation program and are listed in the VISN 4 localities.  Patients may self enroll by calling a toll free number which will be answered by the contractor.  However, the predominant method of referral will be by VA providers who will enter a CPRS consultation which will be accessed by the vendor who then will call the veteran.  If a veteran decides not to be enrolled in the program on the first call, no enrollment will occur.  If a veteran enrolls but fails to complete subsequent calls, the veteran will remain enrolled in the program as some choose to reinitiate counseling later.  A veteran can only enroll once every 365 days.d. The Contractor will provide to each Participant a "quick kit" of printed materials to assist with tobacco cessation before counseling begins.

When an outbound counseling telephone call is attempted three (3) times without reaching the Participant, a follow-up letter will be sent to the Participant and documented as a Progress Note.  All Progress Notes will be entered within two (2) business days of the contact.  A Progress Note is the progress report of each individual veteran's summary of their success rate in the program.g. The Contractor will provide to participants decision support and recommendations for tobacco cessation based on criteria developed by the Contractor.  After the Contractor's Tobacco Treatment Specialist assesses the need for pharmacotherapy for a veteran participant and the recommended quantity, this recommendation will be documented in the VA CPRS Progress Note which is entered to document counseling.  A VA employee who has prescription privileges will be designated to enter the prescription into CPRS for the veteran.

The NRT will then be provided to the veteran through the usual VA pharmacy process.  Contractor standard protocol for the nicotine patch is an eight-week course of therapy, and standard protocol for the nicotine gum is a 4- or 5-box course of therapy, depending on level of addiction.  h.

Connectivity to the VA will be through a VA VPN account utilizing Contractor provided Internet Service Provider (ISP).

<AWARDEE>METEOR COMMUNICATION CORP., 22614 66TH AVE. SOUTH, kENT, WA 98032 US
<DESC>FAR 6.302-1 (2) (ii) (A) (B), Non-competitive award to Metero Communication Corporation.

This award is a non competitive contract of services, hardware and software items from Meteor Communications Corporation (MCC) in Kent, Washington to enhance the two NRCS meteor burst master stations and the Central Computer Facility (CCF) located at the National Water and Climate Center.

The SNOTEL system is the largest meteor burst remote data collection system in the world, with approximately 670 stations operating throughout the western US.  MCC produced the original meteor burst software and the hardware at the master stations and remote stations associated with the ability collect data. The software, which handles the communication between the remote stations and master stations, is proprietary in nature.  The NWCC is in the process of upgrading the remote stations and must change the master station and CCF software and some hardware items in order to effectively take advantage of the new system capabilities.

The changes that are required allow the NWCC and Data Collection Offices to remotely re-program the dataloggers associated with the remote stations using meteor burst communication.  Currently, we are not able to send updated programs to our remote station with our current software and hardware design and a field technician must travel back out to the station to make a program change, which is very costly.  In this proposal, MCC will take their COTS hardware and software and modify it in order for it to run in the NWCC environment.  The modifications to the software involve the knowledge of the existing proprietary meteor burst communication software and hardware and would limit other potential vendors to effectively make the new system work.  

 To attempt full and open competition for a procurement of the new hardware and software and the integration of their system into the NWCC environment would create a substantial duplication of cost that most likely could never be recovered.  It would also incur unacceptable product development delays to fulfill agency requirements. 

Minimal downtime of the SNOTEL system is a major requirement in this contract because the data are required for water resource assessments.  MCC is fully aware of the importance and has planned accordingly to ensure that downtime is at a minimum.  The changes required under this contract should be completed in less than 90 days after award.
