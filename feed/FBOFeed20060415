<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates award of one (1) fixed-price requirements type contract with economic price adjustment for the Office of Education in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT).  The period of performance will be five (5) years with no options.  USAID anticipates that this will be a negotiated acquisition using the lowest price, technically acceptable methodology.  The purpose of this contract is to secure the services of one Health and Accident Coverage (HAC) insurance provider to: (a) implement, manage and provide health insurance and related administrative services to cover foreign (non-U.S. citizens) participants worldwide coming to the U.S for training or attending training in other countries and sponsored by USAID; (b) broker insurer risk to a commercial insurer or provide insurance directly under the contract in accordance with prevailing insurance industry standards and regulations; and (c) cover claims in accordance with the provisions of the contract policy directly to health providers drawing on premiums collected from USAID sponsoring units or their contracted agents.  The HAC provider must be able to fulfill the above requirements and must meet the insurance provider standards of reliability set by the United States Department of State under the Exchange Visitor Program whose regulations are found in 22 CFR 62.14.  The Exchange Visitor Program regulations are available at the following website:   http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/12feb20041500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/22cfr62.14.htm .  

USAID estimates the value of this contract is $8 million for five years.  USAID further estimates that 75,000 foreign participants will require HAC coverage over the five year contract period (subject to the availability of funds).  

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 524210.  USAID anticipates that the solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued (estimated to be late April or early May 2006).  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only on www.fbo.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Mr. Dean Cabrera, Contract Specialist, U.S. Agency for International Development, M/OAA/DCHA/DOFDA, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.10-40, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, D.C. 20523,  (email: dcabrera@usaid.gov).

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to invite comments and suggestions on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of a new Ethiopian Care and Support for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS contract. The goal of the contract is to focus on HIV/AIDS Care and Support at health centers and in communities in Ethiopia. The awarded contractor shall work in collaboration with current PEFFAR Ethiopia partners and in partnership with the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), in particular Regional Health Bureaus and woreda health offices, to provide HIV/AIDS care and support activities throughout Ethiopia. The focus of the three-year Contract (with two 1-year options) shall be at the health center level, in the community -- called kebeles in Ethiopia -- and with families.  Five results are to be achieved under this Contract based on several implementation modalities. New approaches for care and support are included under this Contract, most notably the deployment of case managers and Kebele Oriented Outreach Workers (KOOWs).
