<DESC>USAID/Armenia plans to procure goods and services to implement a five year (3 year base period and a 2 year option period)Program for Improved Energy Management to Enhance Energy Security.  The purpose of the Program is to provide technical assistance to the Republic of Armenia in extending reform and restructuring to improve the efficiency of resource use in the energy and heat supply sectors.  This focus is based in part on these sectors’ continued need for improved transparency and commercial motivation in governance in order to reduce the opportunities for corruption and to improve the quality of service delivered to customers.  It is also motivated by the compelling need to manage and use Armenia’s scarce energy resources with greater efficiency and in an environmentally sustainable way. Improving economic efficiency and sustainable energy resource management will provide essential building blocks required to ensure a sound foundation for sustainable economic growth and to improve the quality of life for all Armenians.  

This program will provide technical assistance, training and some commodity support primarily to institutions working to introduce more efficient and environmentally sound management of energy and heat supply systems, including improved governance of the institutions that provide services using these resources.  It is expected that with management in place in energy and heat supply utility services that is more transparent, commercially-motivated and effectively regulated, these entities will seek to identify and implement activities that reduce waste, manage demand, increase supply, and improve the quality of service.  Each of these outcomes contributes to increase Armenia’s energy security.  In addition to promoting more efficient energy use in ways which are both environmentally sound and increase economic growth, increasing Armenia’s energy security will involve developing the country’s substantial renewable energy resources. Training and building local capacity are significant elements of this program and the broad objectives of human capacity development must be integrated in implementing the program. Commodity support will be given to counterpart institutions for pilot projects and where it is determined that commodities would significantly increase the effectiveness and/or transparency of the recipient.  The program will identify whether there are any significant gender impacts of its main technical directions and will design and implement appropriate actions to reflect these.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire, under single source procedures, Digital Altimeter Setting Indicator (DASI) systems, from DME Corporation, Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  The DASI system consists of a Sensor Translator (S/T) and Digital Display Panel (DDP).  The DASI system computes and displays Altimeter Setting Indicator (ASI) for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC).  The DASI measures the atmospheric pressure and converts the measured pressure value into the actual sea level pressure based on the U.S. Standard Atmosphere Table.  The ASI value is transmitted by ATC to the pilots for their use in setting the altimeter in the aircraft.  The requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for two additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with DME Corporation, the original manufacturer, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The Government intends to acquire a commercially available product using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.  NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) is a partner in implementing the U.S. portion of the Argo program.  This program is an international effort to measure the temperature and salinity fields in upper 2 km of the global ocean by instrumenting it with an array of 3000 profiling CTD floats. Floats must be ship deployment-ready profiling floats equipped with CTDs and Service Argos telemetry/position fix capability.  The floats must be capable of a sufficient gross fractional volume change (1%) to allow cycling between the surface and 2000-dbar pressure over nearly all of the global (ice free) ocean; to park for predetermined 5-15 day periods at a different predetermined subsurface pressure than their profiling pressure (park and profile capability).  Floats must be capable of sampling temperature, salinity, and pressure at a minimum of 70 predetermined pressures during their ascent, then transmitting those data to shore via Service Argos. Floats must have sufficient energy to perform these and other functions for a minimum of 4 years with a duty cycle of 10 days.  All floats are required to provide a minimum of 10 profiles at a specified pressure.  Offerors will be required to provide information that shows the past performance of any offered float, to include the number produced, deployment performance record, and stability and reliability status in multi-year missions.  A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) consisting of a base year and options for two additional years.  Performance of the floats will be the key to exercising option year(s).  Delivery orders will be issued on an as-needed basis with minimum and maximum ordering levels established. A Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about May 20, 2003, through the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  It is incumbent upon interested parties to register at the solicitation's site for notification and to review the site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  Technical questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed to judi.m.jzyk@noaa.gov.  This procurement is unrestricted.  The NAICS Code is 332313.  All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.*****

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA). This Federal Business Opportunities, (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed contract award to The Boeing Company. ESC/SRK intends to award a contract to provide for the Multimedia Message Manager (M3) software maintenance.  M3 software maintenance includes all labor, material, equipment and services to perform the following software engineering tasks: 1) Maintain and troubleshoot the current M3 software and documentation baseline as required.  2) Operate and manage the M3 8x5 Code 2 help desk (Code 2 problems adversely affect the operation of the system).  3) Operate and manage the M3 24x7 Code 1 help desk  (Code 1 problems prevent the accomplishment of essential/critical system capabilities).  4) Install M3 (including hardware, software, network and CSP connections, etc.) at new customer sites.  5) Provide M3 training for System Administrators (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), Profile Administrators (PA) and Users at new customer sites.  6) Support M3 Security Accreditation Testing (SAT) at new customer sites.  7) Transition old message traffic to M3 at new customer sites.  8) Create initial M3 profile set and accounts at new customer sites. 9) Implement new functional enhancements and bug fixes in M3 for new version releases as required. 10) Update all M3 documentation for new version releases as required. 11) Upgrade existing customer sites to latest M3 version releases with little or no disruption of operational services.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6-302-1 entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:" Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-A9(1).  A Request For Information (RFI) was released to industry in October 2002 with responses required to be submitted by 17 November 2002.  Based on the responses to this RFI, the Government considers that an award to any source other than The Boeing Company would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in filling the Government's requirements.  Current M3 functionality must continue to maintain continuity of vital message handling services supporting national-level intelligence requirements.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for the M3 would incur substantial duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration knowledge of the M3, which would not be recovered through competition as well as the loss of critical uninterrupted software maintenance.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Call Heidi Bosinger-Waldron, Contract Specialist, (781) 377-4056, EMAIL Heidi.Bosinger-Waldron@hanscom.af.mil, or Major Mitch S. Appley, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-5541, EMAIL:  Mitch.Appley@hanscom.af.mil See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDCSS), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to CMC Electronics Cincinnati of Mason OH for nine (9) commercial off the shelf NightMaster thermal imaging systems.  The systems are light-weight, handheld portable equipment. The systems will be provided to the U.S. Marine Corp (USMC) Combat Engineer Battalion (CEB) for the purpose of conducting experiments related to the development of tactics and doctrine for conducting reconnaissance and surveillance in support of countermine operations (e.g., detection of enemy routes, detection of mining activity, visually searching an area looking for thermal anomalies that are mine-like-object (MLO), and mine/booby-trap/obstacle/improvised explosive device location.  In addition to experimentation, this purchase is will a lso provide an interim “go-to-war” capability. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. (a) This acquisition leverages a field Military User Assessment (MUA) conducted by the U.S. Air Force in which the NightMaster demonstrated the highest degree of performance when compared with four other commercially available systems. The NightMaster was originally designed for the U.S. Army.  (b)  The countermine mission experiments will require an extremely high degree of resolution and detection ranges. The performance in terms of resolution demonstrated by the NightMaster system during the MUA shows excellent potential for success in this mission area. This performance is based on a patented InSb IR focal plane array architecture proprietary to CMC Electronics.  The key specification for the type of performance achieved relate to the Focal  Plane Array (FPA) technology and filter (MidWave Infrared, InSb 256x256 FPA, reticulated , front-side illuminated, > 99.5% good pixels, dual band, 3.6 to 5.0 microns, CO2 interference removal ) . (c) Other key performance parameters of interest for the system are: (1) Capable of operating in all climates (from 32C to +55C),The system weight is less than seven pounds including dual FOV lens and integrated battery.  The system can be operated in a hand-held mode or remotely operated on a field tripod.  System designed to meet the requirements of MIL-STD-810E for environmental hazards such as fungus, shock and vibration, rain and humidity, drop and bench handling, and high-altitude operation. CSS has conducted an extensive market survey and literature search that resulted in the identification of the CMC Electronics NightMaster thermal imaging system as the only commercially avail able product that meets the key performance parameters of interest to the USMC.

<DESC>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) invite bids for an external Project Management Team (PMT) to manage, on NATO’s behalf, the construction of its new Headquarters.

The new NATO headquarters project involves the design and construction of a park of modern office buildings including special security-enhanced protected areas (communications center, classified document registries, etc.), a large conference center, various common facilities (Information and Press, restaurants, café bars, cafeterias, shops, etc.), a staff center (sport, leisure and cultural activities), utilities, roads, car parks and landscaping works.

The selected PMT will receive policy guidance from, and report directly to, the Internal Management Group (IMG) which represents the owner of the project and has overall responsibility for the project. The IMG, appointed by the nations, will monitor the services of the PMT, Concept Design team (CDT) and Works Contractors. The PMT will co-ordinate the work of the CDT and the Contractors.

In order to safeguard fair and open competition, thereby ensuring that all bidders are treated equally, objectively and impartially, all companies, consultants or sub-consultants, declared or known to NATO, who have been, or are currently commissioned, by NATO, to provide support/intellectual services for the new NATO Headquarters project, will be excluded from participating in this PMT competition.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Amersham Bioscience in Piscataway, NJ to furnish, deliver, and install a new AKTA FPLC System, Software and Accessories at the USDA, ARS, NAA, N.E. Plant, Soil & Water Lab (NEPSWL), University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469. The NAICS is 334516 with a size of 500 employees and is unrestricted. The USDA, ARS, NEPSWL requires the Amersham Biosciences AKTA FPLC System and Accessories which will be used in the research and study of the principles of manure phosphorus chemistry for protein purification and gel filtrations of organic P in relevant agricultural sources.  Gel filtration chromatography will be used to investigate molecular size distribution of organic phosphorus in extracts from animal manure.  The system will also provide a means to purify phosphate-releasing enzymes with various chromatographic columns.  These purified enzymes will allow us to identify the types and determine the amounts of organic P with more accuracy. Purification of biomolecules from complex starting materials is a key component necessary for obtaining information about individual enzymes and their associated activities.  The ability to easily develop and optimize separation methods and protocols for isolating and characterizing research quantities of enzymes has been of critical importance in the application for enzyme-based technologies.  The system has great versatility and can be used to perform separations based on a wide variety of sample characteristics, including, but not limited to molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity.  For NEPSWLs intended applications, the AKTA-FPLC system, software and accessories must be fully integrated. SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS of the system are: Cold-room compatible. Biocompatible, syringe style dual pump system that can provide a flow rate range of 0.05 to 20 ml/min. with pressure ranges from 0-5 Mpa to allow the use of a variety of chromatographic columns.  A fraction collector capable of collecting by volume or automatic peak fractionation of up to 175 fractions.  Fraction marks and fraction numbers allow for easy identification of fractions and peeks.  The system must have a UV monitor with Hg lamp including 280nm and 254nm filters with an option of a Zn lamp for reading at 214nm for higher sensitivity.  The UV monitor must have a signal output range of 0.01 to 5.0 AUFS. The sensitivity of the conductivity monitor must be 1 uS/cm to 999mS/cm.  Ability to control up to nine motorized, electronically-driven valves which will allow simultaneously, expediting method changes and stepwise purification techniques.  Three-position motorized injection valve with a variety of loading loops and super loops to provide the capability of loading from 10 ml to 150ml of sample volume.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the International Social Security Association (ISSA) of Geneva, Switzerland with the intention of awarding a contract for the services described in this announcement. SSA has a need for research and dissemination of information on international social security programs.

Executives within SSA use this information, as do other executive agencies, the Congress, researchers and the public. This activity generates the standard reference document, Social Security Programs Throughout the World (SSPTW).  SSPTW is an internationally respected publication which has been produced by the Social Security Administration since 1937. A continuous flow of accurate and reliable data on international programs is critical to this program effort.  This project calls for the contractor to collect information on social security programs in approximately 175 countries, analyze the data, and produce 4 separate volumes of SSPTW.  The project also calls for the contractor to update the CD-ROM databases that include: 1). the full text of social security laws; 2). information on recent developments in social security; and 3) SSPTW. The contractor will be required to obtain and provide translations and any other support services necessary to the successful conduct and completion of the project. The ISSA possesses unique qualifications and capabilities in the social security field to meet the project requirements and successfully carry out its objectives.  For the past 2 decades the ISSA has collected information on social security developments and trends worldwide. The ISSA has proprietary control of the information it collects for both SSPTW and the CD-ROM (data in the CD-ROM's  legislative database, NATLEX, is provided by special agreement with International Labor Office.)  The ISSA regularly produces a number of social security publications on related topics.  The ISSA specializes in social security and has unique and long-established contacts. The ISSA’s affiliate members in 139 countries, as well as associate members in 40 countries with whom it has established working relationships, support the Association’s aims: the protection, promotion, and development of social security throughout the world.  In addition, the ISSA has contacts with about 47 non-member countries for the purpose of obtaining social security program information.  Furthermore, the ISSA, which had been in operation since 1927, provides a symposium for the international exchange of information in all areas of social security as broadly defined. The ISSA is a nonpolitical international organization. U.S. agency conduct of this project would preclude access to otherwise obtainable information from certain countries.  The ISSA has the capability and support services such as expert staff, physical facilities and translation capabilities, as well as social security contacts mentioned above, to ensure the systematic and consistent flow of materials required to effectively conduct this project.  The proposed contract is a fixed-priced term contract, with options for additional services.  Any organization that believes that it has the capability to perform this work may submit a statement of such capability to the Contracting Officer at the following address: Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants, 1710 Gwynn Oak Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21207, ATTN: Maria Hill. Cost for the preparation and submission of proposals will not be reimbursed by the Government. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. SEE NOTE 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Q.  9.  What is the nature of the quarterly reports that are required? (requirement j in the synopsis)  A.  Please see question 2 for answer.
Q.  10.  I am assuming that the yearly updates will consist of the most recent versions of the same 27 items lists in the synopsis. Is this correct?  A.  Yes.  For those publications that are only updated annually we will want the latest version as soon as it is updated.

Q.  18.  Does the government want the CD to print a complete copy of a reference material, or would the government want the CD to be able to print selectable portions of a reference material?  A.

At that time, the Government will present their needs and objectives. One-on-one sessions will be available beginning at 8:00 AM EST on 17 June 2003.  Each Company that had requested a one-on-one session should contact Ms. Janice Sullivan to reschedule.  Contact information is as follows: E-mail address:  Janice.Sullivan@hanscom.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Mary Bretz Office Assistant 5038086359     OR952mb@blm.gov;
<DESC>MODIFICATION:  CORRECTION OF PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to noncompetitively issue a purchase order to Waipuna USA, located at 10 S. 131 Leonard, Hinsdale, IL  60521, for the lease of two hot water weed control systems to accomplish noxious weed control activities in Oregon.  The Waipuna system is uniquely qualified as it uses a foam concentrate of Alkyl Polyglycoside, which is made of sugar extracts derived from corn and coconut.  The concentrate is added to water that is heated to steam temperature, then applied topically to undesirable plants.  Effective treatment depth is approximately 1/2  to 3/4 inches into the soil, thereby killing both noxious weeds and their seeds in one application.  Treatment can occur regardless of weather, during any season, and is effective immediately upon application.  Treated sites may be entered and reseeded immediately thereafter.  Since the Waipuna system does not use herbicides, it can be used in virtually any area regardless of proximity to wildlife, waterways, organic gardens, schools, threatened and endangered plants or humans.  The system leaves no residue in the soil and no special licensing or permits are required.  No other non-chemical weed control techniques, such as propane burners and infrared weeding tools, have been found to possess the same cost, labor and environmental benefits as the Waipuna system.  As a result, Waipuna USA has been selected to provide the equipment as it is the only contractor known to possess all of the following qualifications needed to meet the Bureau's requirements:   1.  Double burner system, allowing two applicators to work simultaneously,  2.  No chemicals, personal protective equipment, soil disturbance (such as hand pulling or digging) required,  3.  Controls noxious weeds and their seeds safely and immediately near sensitive plants, wildlife, humans, roadways,  4.  Can be used effectively regardless of weather or season,  5.  Allows for immediate replanting, reseeding and re-entering in treated area,  5.  90-100 days before retreatment required,  6.  All hardware required for use, 7. Accessories to operate the unit, including items such as hoses with insulation covering (up to 300'), application heads appropriate to types of treatments, and application wands of various sizes and widths, 8. Technical and operating manuals, 9.  Onsite training by manufacturer, 10.  Lifetime customer service.   Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the ten criteria described above to the Contracting Officer.  All responses received within 15 calendar days will be considered.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may submit their specifications via e-mail at or952mb@or.blm.gov, fax 503-808-6312, mail to: Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), PO Box 2965, Portland, OR 97208 or handcarried express packages to: Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), 333 SW 1st Ave, First Floor, Portland, OR 97204.

The specific requirements will be described in a Performance Work Statement (PWS) released with the solicitation. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by the Government to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be conducted prior to solicitation closing; time and date will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be issued on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis, and will include Indefin ite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) line items to accommodate Government-ordered after hours work. Any resultant contract is anticipated to be for a base period and up to four option periods (period of performance not to exceed five total years). Due to the type of work conducted at NSWCDD CSS, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Currently, the Government in-house workforce is performing the Budget and Financial Program Support services. The Navy intends to perform a cost comparison, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-76, in order to determine the most cost effective service provider. Best Value Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The proposals received in response to the solicitation will be fully evaluated by the Source Selection Team on the stated technical evaluation factors. Proposals will be evaluated on the  following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach and Organization; 3) Technical Approach, Experience and Qualifications, 4) Phase in Plan, and 5) Price. The contract will be awarded to the best value contractor if the contractors proposal is more advantageous than the Governments proposal, taking into consideration the minimum cost differential requirements. To be considered more advantageous, contractor’s proposal must be at least 10 percent lower than the Government’s costs in the performance period. The purpose of the minimum cost differential is to avoid the disruption of converting performance of the commercial activity based on a minimal cost savings.  If Government performance is determined to be more advantageous, this solicitation will be cancelled and no contract will be awarded.  If a contractor is selected as the service provider, an award wil l be made in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and all other applicable Navy and Government acquisition regulations. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about 6 June 2003.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of this requirement will be limited to the electronic medium.

<DESC>Solicitation number NA1341-03-Q-0371, dated April 15, 2003, is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. Question:  What is meant by  'Ge Detection System? Answer:  The sentence should read, "All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following" The Germanium Detection System (GE Detection) referenced was an error.  Question:  What are the film thicknesses required for multilayer coatings?
Answer: Both layers may have similar or different thickness, somewhere between 10 nanometers to 1000 nanometers. Typically NIST will deposit a 10 nm thick Chromium layer followed by a 1000 nm thick Copper layer. Or simply 10 nm thick Aluminum layer only. Question: Is 5nM a thickness required? Answer:  This represents desirable maximum cluster size of 5 nanometers (or less), which is related to minimum thickness of the coating. NIST needs to be able to make 10 nanometers thick coatings as well as 1000 nanometers thick. NIST seeks uniformity of 2 % or better in thickness over 1 inch diameter specimen. If coating is 1000 nanometers thick, deviation in the thickness should be less than +- 10 nanometers. Question: Is 10,000 A also a requirement? Answer:  10,000 Angstroms equals 1000 nanometers and is related to typical thickness of the coating. There may be a need to deposit layers thinner or thicker than that. The due date for quotes, May 26, 2003 at 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, remains unchanged.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is seeking Offerors who have the capability to test approximately twenty-five (25) chemicals per year  up to ten (10) years for somatic cell genetic effects in animals, usually rats and/or mice and 50 chemicals per year in the bacteria assay for point mutations.  Endpoints to be assessed will include:
Task 1 - Micronuclei in bone marrow and/or other tissues (e.g. lung, spleen, peripheral lymphocytes).  In these studies, animals will be treated in the contract laboratory.
Task 2 - Micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes from sub-chronic studies.  In these studies,  animals will be treated in other laboratories and cells will be shipped to the contract laboratory for micronucleus scoring.
Task 3 - Centromeric probe analysis of micronuclei
Task 4 - Single cell gel electrophoresis assays of various tissues
Task 5 - Point mutations is salmonella TA98, 100 and 102
Task 6- The Government anticipates a need for work for assay development equivalent to 5% of the work required to perform tasks 1 to 5.
Task 7 - Analysis of genetic toxicity information   

New technology has automated the process of counting the number of micronuclei cells on slides and therefore a Flow Cytometer is required of the Offeror to perform this project.

The Government estimates that Tasks one (1) to six (6) will require approximately six (6) to seven (7) person-years per year.  Task seven (7)  will require one (1) person-year and this position is will be on site at the NIEHS and office space, equipment, and materials will be provided by the government. The period of performance will be ten (10) years.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 and the small size standard is 500 employees or less. The estimated date for receipt of proposals is  June 10th, 2003.   See numbered Notes 1 and 26.

<DESC>The BEP's request for industry comments regarding BEP's plans for future currency production is hereby extended until July 18, 2003.  Additional information is provided per the attached MS Word File.  Accordingly, vendors are requested to submit available information regarding their current and prototype  equipment.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR FIRM PROPOSALS, AND NO CONTRACT AWARD IS PLANNED FROM THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Information will be viewed by U.S. Government personnel for the purposes of identifying equipment of potential use to the BEP in manufacturing the currency of the United States.
Due to security restrictions, there will be little or no opportunity to hold face-to-face meetings at this time.  In addition, due to the volume of responses anticipated, it may not be possible to return phone calls prior to the submission of the requested technical information.  Therefore, vendors should submit the requested information and the Government will contact vendors with equipment possessing the capabilities needed if further information is needed.  Again, this is not a request for firm proposals and no contract award is planned from this request for information.  However, the BEP will identify and program funding based in part on information received from this announcement, therefore vendors are encouraged to respond with available information electronically to george.robertson@bep.treas.gov.  Vendors are discouraged from hand-delivering materials to the BEP due to security requirements.  If materials are hand-delivered, the courier must be instructed to go to the employee entrance of the BEP, contact the procurement office and wait until materials are picked up by procurement personnel.  The security police officers will not accept materials from couriers.  The address for hand-delivery or courier-delivery is BEP Procurement, Attn:  George Robertson, 13th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228. Call 202-874-3255 or 202-874-3142 for pickup. The address for overnight mail or regular mail delivery is Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Office of Procurement, Equip and Services Division, Attn:  George Robertson, 14th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0004 to combined synopsis/solicitation number USZA22-03-R-0027 that was issued on 22 Apr 2003 for BALCS-Compatible Quick Release Body Armor Vests. The purpose of this amendment is to publish questions from industry and the Government's responses.     QUESTION 1. The solicitation states, "Offerors must scrutinize this solicitation and ensure their proposals and submissions comply with all requirements. It is not sufficient to merely state your vests comply with the solicitation requirements - you must clearly identify how your proposed vest meets ALL solicitation requirements."  The solicitation clearly states that the evaluation of compliance to these standards is "subjective" and therefore is any data sufficient?  Are statement from the units that have tested our system acceptable? Are Independent Lab tests required?  What is the standard?   ANSWER 1: The quoted language is boilerplate phrases used in many solicitations to put potential offerors on notice that they must read the solicitation carefully to ensure compliance with the solicitation requirements.  This is a tactical nylon product (a vest cover only) and only hard data on the materials used is required.  For example, the info we are seeking is data such as "Cloth Oxford Nylon Type 1 Class 3 of MIL-C-508", "Webbing MIL-W-4088 Type 1A and Type VIII, MIL-W-17337 Type II", etc.  Any additional data provided on construction methods (stitch count, thread size, etc.), weights, IR suppression capability, etc., will be considered.  While you are correct that a subjective evaluation will be conducted required regarding functionality this is merely an acknowledgement of the nature of the evaluation that is conducted for all solicitations based upon a best value assessment.  Particularly in the area of functionality, the ease of use and lack of impact on user movement while wearing the vest is of critical importance and most accurately demonstrated by having the user representatives conduct their evaluation based upon their operational requirements.  No formal hard data is required to demonstrate functionality.  However, any user feedback from existing sales will be taken into consideration.    QUESTION 2.  The Natick SOF team was at Ft. Bragg on the April 16, 2003, and demonstrated a Releasable Vest to USASOC and others.  This design was developed by the SOF team at Natick in conjunction with several other manufacturers.   ANSWER 2:  The author is incorrect.  This vest was not "developed by the SOF Team at Natick in conjunction with several other manufacturers."  The vest shown at the USASOC briefing was a COTS releasable vest, made by Eagle Industries for another program (FSBE II).   QUESTION 3.  What company produced the vest that is being shown and demonstrated by the SOF team (see question 2)?   ANSWER 3.  The vest shown and demonstrated by Natick was a vest made by Eagle Industries and is a candidate for the USMC FSBE II program.   QUESTION 4.  Will the Eagle Industries vest shown at USASOC (see question 2) also be evaluated for this requirement?    ANSWER 4. The Government is not considering any particular vest for satisfaction of the solicitation requirements.  We have completed a market survey and have synopsized as a fully open small business set-aside.  If the vendor (Eagle) submits it as a candidate it will be evaluated.   QUESTION 5.  Was Eagle Industries given any advanced notice of the requirements of this Solicitation?   ANSWER 5. Not to the best of our knowledge.   QUESTION 6.  When the requirements listed in this solicitation were written, was the Natick-designed vest [FSBE] used as the guide?  Example: Two emergency release mechanisms.   ANSWER 6.  The solicitation baseline for the BALCSR was developed from the BALCS vest system not the FSBE.  The intent is to solicit and down select a BALCS vest with a dual release capability.   QUESTION 7.  Was the Natick-developed vest pre-tested to meet the requirements of this Solicitation?   ANSWER 7. No Natick-designed vest will be a candidate under this solicitation.   QUESTION 8.  Will commercial standards compliance be acceptable in place of Mil Spec for materials items on the vests that use commercial items?   ANSWER 8:  Commercial materials will be allowed to substitute for MIL-SPEC materials.  However, corroborative data must be supplied to allow comparison to MIL-SPEC standards.  The critical line in the solicitation regarding this issue is: "The BALCSR vest must contain equal or better than the materials incorporated in the original BALCS vest."  Offerors shall provide information to conclusively demonstrate commercial materials meet or exceed the materials in the current BALSC Vest.  These materials meet MIL-Spec _______ standards.  Additional testing of commercial materials may be required to validate performance.   QUESTION 9.  We are contemplating submitting a developmental item in response to this solicitation.  Two weeks seems to be too short of a proposal preparation period.    ANSWER 9.  The Government is seeking Commercial Off The Shelf items in response to this solicitation and consequently a lenghty proposal preparation period is not necessary.  The solicitation was extended to 16 May by Amendment 0003.    QUESTION 10.  The solicitation calls for a signed SF1449 as part of the proposal, however this is a combined synopsis/solicitation and no SF1449 was issued.  Please clarify.    ANSWER 10.  The requirement to submit a signed SF1449 was removed as part of Amendment 0003.    QUESTION 11:  What color do you want the initial 4 samples in (i.e. 3-Color Desert, Woodland, Black)?   ANSWER 11: Color does not matter for these 4 samples.   QUESTION 12: Do you have a Certs and Reps Packet with the forms you need filled out for this solicitation you can email me?   ANSWER 12:  The certs and reps simply consist of completed FAR Clause 52.212-3 and DFARS Clause 252.212-7000.  These clauses can be downloaded from any website that contains these regulations. You can find links to online versions of the FAR and DFARS at http://deskbook.dau.mil.

<ARCHDATE>05042004
<CONTACT>Mary Bretz Office Assistant 5038086359     OR952mb@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to noncompetitively issue a purchase order to Waipuna USA, located at 10 S. 131 Leonard, Hinsdale, IL  60521, for the lease of two hot water weed control systems to accomplish noxious weed control activities in Oregon.  The Waipuna system is uniquely qualified as it uses a foam concentrate of Alkyl Polyglycoside, which is made of sugar extracts derived from corn and coconut.  The concentrate is added to water that is heated to steam temperature, then applied topically to undesirable plants.  Effective treatment depth is approximately ? to ? " into the soil, thereby killing both noxious weeds and their seeds in one application.  Treatment can occur regardless of weather during any season and is effective immediately upon application.  Treated sites may be re-entered and reseeded immediately thereafter.  Since the Waipuna system does not use herbicides, it can be used in virtually any area regardless of proximity to wildlife, waterways, organic gardens, schools, threatened and endangered plants or humans.  The system leaves no residue in the soil and no special licensing or permits are required.  No other non-chemical weed control techniques, such as propane burners and infra-red weeding tools, have been found to possess the same cost, labor and environmental benefits as the Waipuna system.  As a result, Waipuna USA has been selected to provide the equipment as it is the only contractor known to possess all of the following qualifications needed to meet the Bureau's requirements:   1.  Double burner system, allowing two applicators to work simultaneously,  2.  No chemicals, personal protective equipment, soil disturbance (such as hand pulling or digging) required,  3.  Controls noxious weeds and their seeds safely and immediately near sensitive plants, wildlife, humans, roadways,  4.  Can be used effectively regardless of weather or season,  5.  Allows for immediate replanting, reseeding and re-entering in treated area,  5.  90-100 days before retreatment required,  6.  All hardware required for use, 7. Accessories to operate the unit, including items such as hoses with insulation covering (up to 300'), application heads appropriate to types of treatments, and application wands of various sizes and widths, 8. Technical and operating manuals, 9.  Onsite training by manufacturer, 10.  Lifetime customer service.   Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the ten criteria described above to the Contracting Officer.  All responses received within 15 calendar days will be considered.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may submit their specifications via e-mail at or952mb@or.blm.gov, fax 503-808-6312, mail to: Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), PO Box 2965, Portland, OR 97208 or handcarried express packages to: Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), 333 SW 1st Ave, First Floor, Portland, OR 97204.

<DESC>The Combat Direction Systems Activity, Dahlgren Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is conducting market research and seeking expressions of interest for developing a customized software editing tool which supports manual editing of the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) Learning Management System (LMS) e-Learning courses. The USJFCOM Training Directorate uses the LMS to train our military forces to ensure they are prepared to fight as part of a joint and multi-national team.  A major component of this training is delivered through Advanced Distance Learning (ADL) using USJFCOM LMS e-Learning courses.  These courses are developed in English and then must be manually translated into other languages to provide effective training for coalition partners.  However, the time and effort of developing these courses in multiple languages increases exponentially with the number of l anguages.  This tool will provide the ability for human foreign language translators to manually edit and translate e-Learning course content into coalition languages for effective training.  The Alpha version of this tool as described below must be completed and delivered within 60 days following contract award. Requirements for this editing tool shall include the following:  Provide the ability to accept as input any Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or Sharable Content Reference Model (SCORM) compliant e-Learning course package and assist the user (translator) in editing course content and produce an HTML or SCORM compliant output package in the target language, which can then be imported into any HTML or SCORM compliant LMS system. Provide the ability to initially support language translation between English, Russian, French, Spanish, and German with the flexibilit y for additional language support at a later time. Provide the ability to support manual language translation of e-Learning courses developed in any source language to any target language (initially English, Russian, French, Spanish, and German with flexibility for additional language support at a later time). Provide the ability for proof reading, editing and correcting course content by using the same source and target languages. Provide the ability to perform basis editing functions of e-Learning courses being edited including, but not limited to editing (copy, paste, insert, delete, etc.), spell check, font manipulation, etc. Provide the ability for users to preview both source and translated content during the editing process. Provide the ability to swap out course media objects (images, audio files, etc.) for editing purposes in another tool, which can then  imported back into the course and used during the editing process. The tool shall be designed to be user-friendly, capable of being operated by users with minimal technical skills (non-programmers), shielding the user from the technical details of e-learning course content structure. The tool will have a web-user interface with appropriate access controls and authorizations, and provide the ability to support large numbers of users and high volumes of content with either a dial-up modem or broadband connection. Support for any or all of the following languages may be required in the future: List of Languages Albanian	           Arabic Armenian	           Azerbaijani Belarusian	           Bulgarian Croatian	           Czech Danish	                   Dutch English	                   Estonian Finnish	                   French Georgian	           German Gree k	                   Hungarian Icelandic	           Italian Japanese	           Kazak Krygyz	                   Latvian Lithuanian	           Macedonian Mandarin Chinese	   Moldovan Norwegian	           Polish Portuguese	           Romanian Russian	                   Serbo-Croatian Slovak	                   Slovenian Spanish	                   Swedish Tajik	                   Thai Turkish	                   Turkmen Ukrainian	           Uzbek	 Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above proposed requirements should submit an expression of interest/capability statement (maximum of ten (10) typed pages) indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above.  Responses must include the following: firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile number, internet address, size of firm, and direct  point of contact including phone and e-mail address.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail, or facsimile will be accepted.  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only.  The Government will not provide the data received from one responder to other potentially competitive organizations.

<SUBJECT>A -- Kinetic Energy Interceptors Space Based Test Bed Request for Information
<DESC>In January 2002, the Secretary of Defense directed the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) provide the US, its allies, deployed forces, and friends with a layered ballistic missile defense system. This ballistic missile defense system defeats missiles of all ranges and in all phases of flight. 

The Director, MDA, took the Secretary’s direction and tasked the Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office to develop a program yielding a kinetic boost/ascent phase capability against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles as soon as practical.  The Director further requested a competitive program rapidly delivering capabilities to the BMDS test bed.  

The existing program strategy consists of two major efforts.  We plan to use a capability-based acquisition with the goal of determining what capability can be delivered, when.  
Contracts were recently awarded to two teams for the definition of a mobile, terrestrially based, boost/ascent test bed element.  The contractors’ efforts focus on delivering as early as Block 08 (January 2008-December 2009).  The second element invests in the development of a space-based interceptor test bed.

The Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office seeks information regarding industry’s ability to design, develop, and implement a space based test bed for ballistic missile defense interceptors.  The Program Office is developing its procurement strategy to get this capability and wants industry help in constructing it.  We envision a strategy resulting in a best value acquisition with full and open competition.  

Information desired at this time:

<SUBJECT>D -- D - - DFAS Technology Services
<DESC>DFAS Technology Services 
Transformation Market Research / Request for Information (RFI)

PURPOSE

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) was established in January 1991 to improve Department of Defense (DOD) finance and accounting operations.  Prior to DFAS, DOD performed finance and accounting functions at various installations/activities using non-standard systems and procedures. Over the years, DFAS consolidated offices, reduced manpower, reduced systems, reorganized into business line structure, and received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002.  DFAS has three major business lines: Accounting Services, Commercial Pay Services and Military and Civilian Pay Services.

DFAS has been designated as the finance and accounting firm for the Department of Defense.   DFAS pays over 5 million DOD military and civilians worldwide.  On an annual basis, DFAS processes over 11 million invoices from contractors, records over 100 million accounting transactions, and disburses over $300 billion.  DFAS pays over 7 million travel vouchers, manages more than $100 billion in military retirement trust funds, and accounts for more than $12 billion in foreign military sales.  DFAS is responsible for over 200 active DoD appropriations.

Information technology services are critical to the DFAS mission.  DFAS technology services include planning, developing architectures, designing, building, operating, and maintaining essential telecommunications and computing infrastructure and systems.  These technology services must adhere to DOD and DFAS standards and procedures and are currently provided by DFAS, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and other government and commercial organizations.

The current environment is one in which we must examine our functions and processes to ensure we have in place the best organization possible to accomplish DOD’s goals and to provide quality service and best value to our customers.  On September 10, 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the Department of Defense would begin examination and review of the Defense Agencies to determine if functions or processes could be improved.  This announcement led to the development of a DFAS Transformation Strategy.  DFAS is currently developing a Transformation Strategy for DFAS Technology Services.
  
This notification is part of the Transformation Strategy.  It is not a solicitation for services.  This notification is not, in any way, a manifestation of intent to engage in any transformation strategy that will, necessarily, involve the private-sector.  It is only a market survey approach to determine whether the market contains the capability to perform the functions described.  No decision has been made to pursue any kind of private-sector commercial involvement.  This notification is only an attempt to determine whether, at a future date, options that involve commercial involvement can be included in the list of possible transformation strategies that DFAS may consider.  If, for example, at a future date a competitive sourcing were to be studied, information to support that study would be solicited at that time in accordance with the applicable regulatory and statutory requirements.

<SUBJECT>A -- Portable Chemical Sensor (IOCE Lab-on-a-Chip)
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE A PORTABLE CHEMICAL SENSOR

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to manufacture and market a portable chemical sensor based on lab-on-a-chip technology. 

The sensor, developed at LLNL, has demonstrated high sensitivity (ppb concentrations) for a variety of substances in aqueous form. Nearly any substance that can be carried in water is directly detectable. It is based on the well-known capillary electrophoresis technique that makes protocol development and validation straightforward. A unique aspect of the LLNL approach is the use of non-fluorescent optical sensing, which eliminates the need for sample derivitization or tagging. Commercial applications include medical and biological research, environmental monitoring, industrial hygiene, and emergency response. Government applications include detection of activities associated with the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction—chemical, biological, and nuclear. 

The successful industrial partner(s) will be responsible for fabrication of the critical sensor chip, requiring the following MEMS capabilities: etching of microfluidic channels in quartz; embedded optical waveguides; quartz-quartz bonding; and fiber-optic termination. Additionally, the partner(s) will be responsible for fabricating and/or integrating a microfluidic subsystem, lasers, photonic integrated circuits, embedded microcontrollers, electronic interfaces and power supplies, and operating software, into a complete, portable instrument. LLNL will provide substantial guidance in this cooperative partnership

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's chemical sensor technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

<SUBJECT>A -- Thermal Cycler for PCR Systems
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE A THERMAL CYCLER FOR PCR SYSTEMS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to manufacture and market its next generation thermal cycler for use in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) systems. 

The thermal cycler is designed to be versatile, small, fast, robust, low power and low cost. It is suitable for either flow systems or sequestered samples, accommodating volumes from several microliters to several hundred microliters, with excellent temperature uniformity throughout the sample. Cycling speed is inherently fast due to small size and efficient heat transfer, with the cooling rate being driven by air flow. 

The system is highly modular, allowing a wide choice of packaging options, including arrays of cycling chambers. Real-time optical detection is also an option, depending on the needs and application of the particular PCR system involved. The design also makes full use of off-the-shelf components and existing fabrication technologies to provide a low cost advantage at both the component and manufacturing levels.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our US licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or nonexclusive licensing agreements as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information. Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's chemical sensor technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

<SUBJECT>A -- Nastic Structures (NAST) Workshop
<DESC>Nastic Structures (NAST) Workshop, SN03-19. The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a workshop on Nastic Structures (NAST).  The workshop will be held July 1, 2003, at the Executive Conference Center in Arlington, Virginia.  Nastic and tropic movements in plants enable actions such as sun tracking and the capture of prey.  Of interest to this workshop are technological developments that will enable the development of a practical material system that can mimic the ability of plants to generate large strains while carrying significant structural loads.  The ultimate goal is the development of highly controllable and reversible material systems that can generate 10 Megapascals and 20% in blocked stress and free strain, respectively.  The workshop is intended to help researchers in various disciplines self-assemble into teams capable of developing plant inspired actuation systems that will ultimately have application in military adaptive or morphing structures. Plant actuators possess a number of common features that may prove useful in future motion control and shape control systems: 1) Structural shape changes are accomplished through size changes in antagonistic volumes of plant tissue.  For example, bending is accomplished when plant tissue on top of a branch gets larger while the tissue on the bottom shrinks.  Bulk strains on the order of 10-20% have been observed and response times on the order of seconds to tens of seconds are common.  In special cases large motions are accomplished in milliseconds, but these motions are not quickly reversible; 2) The root cause of the motile response is a change in cell size driven by pressure variations within the plant cells.  The small size and large numbers of plant motor cells provide redundancy in actuation; 3) The pressure state in the cell is controlled by the ion transport characteristics of the cell wall.  The ability of cell walls to transport and contain fluid providesprovides actuation and compressive strength.  The cell walls themselves provide strength in tension.  Thus the plant is essentially aan adaptive composite structure; 4) The transport characteristics of the cell wall are controlled by the presence or absence of both electric fields and ions.  The ability to respond to both chemical and electrical signals provides control redundancy.  It is anticipated that teams ultimately proposing in this area may need expertise in the chemistry, design, control, and mechanics of both plant actuation systems and conventional actuation systems.  A clear military application for the proposed technology is also required.  Please access the workshop website for further details including registration and abstract submission. The event website is www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/Index.asp?meetingid=186.  The workshop registration fee is $73.00 and includes all workshop activities, continental breakfast, and working lunch.  Registration cutoff is June 11, 2003, or at attendance capacity, whichever occurs first.  Space is limited and it is recommended that you register early.  For further administrative information contact NASTWorkshop@darpa.mil.  The technical point of contact is Dr. John Main (jmain@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the NAST workshop in all correspondence.  This announcement is NOT a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time.

TECHNICAL PROVISIONS

GROWING SEASON BURN SEED HARVESTING CONTRACT


TP-01.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to remove approximately 300,000 lbs of native-plant-material seed and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass seed.  The native-plant-material area encompasses approximately 928 acres and the lopsided Indiangrass area consists of 182 acres.

TP-02.  LOCATION OF PROPERTY: The areas to be harvested are located throughout the Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida.  Detailed maps will be provided to prospective bidders and the selected contractor will receive delineated aerial photos of harvest sites..


TP-03.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

The contractor will be allowed to harvest approximately 300,000 pounds of native vegetation and seed on the growing-season-burn tract and 600 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass on the other tract.

	1. Growing-season-burn harvest.  The contractor will use a mower to harvest all vegetation down to a 16-inch height above the ground on the specified tracts.  Harvesting will be done in a pattern that alternates between mowed rows and unmowed rows, ensuring that approximately one-half of the site is harvested.  Cut material will be collected either by hand or with mechanized hay-making equipment.

	2.  Lopsided Indiangrass.  The contractor will collect seed either by hand, utilize a Flayal Vac or Combine, cutting material at 30? or higher.  Harvest of the Indiangrass will start 1 October and end 1 November.

b.  The contract will start 1 October 2002 and end on 30 December 2002. 

d.  Harvesting can begin within 10 working days after advance payment is made.  

e. 	The area shall be cleaned and then inspected by the Rangeland Specialist before moving to a new location.  Areas which are determined to be excessively wet by the Rangeland Specialist shall be worked at a later period of time.

f.   Areas not designated for harvest may not be entered by the contractor.  If sites not in the contract are harvested or otherwise damaged through negligence by the contractor's operations, damages will be assessed at rate of $100.00 per acre of land impacted.  Damaged acreage determinations will be done with Global Positioning System equipment by the Rangeland Specialist.

TP-04.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

a.  The Installation Supervisory Rangeland Specialist shall be contacted either in person or by telephone (863-452-4119, extension 305) prior to performing work under this contract.

b.  To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the flying mission of the Air Force, the Rangeland Specialist will approve all haul roads and trailer locations.  The Rangeland Specialist will also determine which stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting or starting of work may be restricted to certain periods time to coincide with the natural resources management program or the military mission of the Air Force Range.  Harvesting can only be conducted Monday through Thursday.  Work may temporarily be halted or the contract terminated if a conflict, deemed serious by the Base Rangeland Specialist, occurs or was unforeseen.   If the contract is terminated through no fault of the contractor, the complete bid deposit submitted by the contractor shall be refunded.

c.  All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  No activity of any sort shall be allowed by the contractor within the areas as designated on the attached map.  The Base Rangeland Specialist will identify the boundaries of these sensitive areas prior to initiation of work.

d.  All work shall be accomplished by the contractor's personnel and with the contractor's equipment and materials.  All equipment needed for native seed harvesting operations shall be furnished, transported, and maintained by the contractor.

e.  At all times when operations are in progress, the contractor shall have a representative readily available in the area who will be authorized to receive, on behalf of the contractor, any notices or instructions given by the Air Force in regard to performance under this contract.  He shall also have a copy of the map and technical provisions on the site at all times.

TP-05.  INSPECTION: All work is subject to inspection by the Air Force both during and after the contractor's operation.  Unsatisfactory work shall be corrected promptly.

TP-06.  DAMAGE TO AIR FORCE PROPERTY: Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid damaging trees, shrubs, roads, bridges, culverts, fences, utility lines, buildings, or other structures.  Any associated debris accumulated  from the harvest operations shall not be left in roads, trails, ditches, disc lines, or fire breaks.  Air Force property damaged beyond normal wear and tear shall be replaced at the original condition as directed, at no expense to the Air Force. All repairs will be inspected and accepted or rejected by the Air Force. The damage to haul roads while standing water is present or road surfaces are soft from moisture will not be considered as normal wear and tear.

TP-07.  NEW CONSTRUCTION: All new construction by the contractor or subcontractor must be approved by the Air Force before construction begins.

TP-08.  FOREST FIRE SUPPRESSION: The contractor shall exercise due diligence both independently and in cooperation with the Air Force and will take all reasonable and practical action to prevent and suppress forest fires on the contract area or vicinity.  The contractor agrees to reimburse the Air Force for the cost of fire suppression incurred as a result of his negligence and/or willful acts.  All fires shall be reported immediately to the Base Rangeland Specialist.

TP-09.  EXAMINATION OF PREMISES: Bidders are expected to satisfy themselves as to the general location that may affect the cost of performance under this contract.  It is considered impractical to determine by other means the exact nature of the work, site conditions under which the work is to be performed, product breakdown and total quantity to be harvested.  The submission of a bid will be considered as certification that the site has been inspected and the nature of work and the effects of existing and/or adjacent work has been determined.  Inspection of the sites is invited between 8:00 AM. and 3:00 P.M., Monday through Friday (legal holidays excluded), by arrangements with the Base Rangeland Specialist, telephone  (863-452-4119, extension 305).

TP-10.  TRASH AND REFUSE: Trash and refuse resulting from the contractor's operations shall either be removed daily and disposed of on the installation at locations and in a manner as directed by the Base Rangeland Specialist or be carried out by the contractor.  No trash of any sort (tires, oil buckets, etc.) shall be left on the ground at the end of the day.

TP-11.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING:

a.  The basis for payment is pounds of native seed material. Payment shall be made weekly.  A check made payable to the "Treasury of the United States" along with invoice tickets shall be submitted to 347 RQW, DET 1, OL A/CEVN, 29 South Boulevard, Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida 33825-5700, Attention: R. Scott Penfield.

b.  Each truckload of material that leaves the Avon Park Air Force Range may be required by the Air Force to leave a load ticket at a designated location.  If this option is required, the  Rangeland Specialist will inform the contractor of the proper procedure and information needed to meet this requirement.

TP-12.  UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE: The contractor is cautioned that unexploded
ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.  The contractor shall assume full responsibility for such property and shall discharge the Government from any and all damages directly and indirectly resulting from such property.  The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefrom or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Rangeland Specialist so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.

TP-13.  COMPLETION:

a.  The Base Rangeland Specialist shall notify the Contracting Officer when all operations required under this contract are satisfactorily completed.  In the event that the contractor is unable to complete removal of all native seed material designated for removal under this contract, the Rangeland Specialist may, if in his opinion the contractor made diligent effort to complete harvesting, recommend an extension of the contact as specified in Paragraph TP-03c.

b.  All equipment, supplies, etc., belonging to or used by the contractor or subcontractor shall be removed from the Avon Park Air Force Range within 10 days after completion of work.  Rent will be charged at the rate of $20.00 per day per piece of equipment after the 10-day period has expired.  The contractor shall also reimburse the Air Force for the removal of supplies, etc., left by the contractor after this 10-day period.

TP-14.  ACCESS: The Avon Park Air Force Range is located 9 miles east of Avon Park on State Road 64.

TECHNICAL PROVISIONS

GROWING SEASON BURN SEED HARVESTING CONTRACT


TP-01.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to remove approximately 2,000lbs of native seed and 1,000 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass seed.  The native-plant-material area encompasses approximately 887 acres and the lopsided Indiangrass area consists of 636 acres.

TP-02.  LOCATION OF PROPERTY: The areas to be harvested are located throughout the Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida.  Detailed maps will be provided to prospective bidders and the selected contractor will receive delineated aerial photos of harvest sites..


TP-03.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

The contractor will be allowed to harvest approximately 2,000 pounds of native vegetation and seed on the growing-season-burn tract and 1000 lbs of Lopsided Indiangrass on the other tract.

1.	Growing-season-burn harvest.  The contractor will use a Flayal Vac harvester to remove the seed.  Harvesting will be done in a pattern that alternates between harvested and unharvested rows, ensuring that approximately one-half of the site is harvested.  
2.	
	2.  Lopsided Indiangrass.  The contractor will collect seed either by hand, utilize a Flayal Vac or Combine, cutting material at 30? or higher.  Harvest of the Indiangrass will start 1 October and end 1 November.

b.  The contract will start 1 October 2002 and end on 30 December 2002. 

d.  Harvesting can begin within 10 working days after advance payment is made.  

e. 	The area shall be cleaned and then inspected by the Rangeland Specialist before moving to a new location.  Areas which are determined to be excessively wet by the Rangeland Specialist shall be worked at a later period of time.

f.   Areas not designated for harvest may not be entered by the contractor.  If sites not in the contract are harvested or otherwise damaged through negligence by the contractor's operations, damages will be assessed at rate of $100.00 per acre of land impacted.  Damaged acreage determinations will be done with Global Positioning System equipment by the Rangeland Specialist.

TP-04.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

a.  The Installation Supervisory Rangeland Specialist shall be contacted either in person or by telephone (863-452-4119, extension 305) prior to performing work under this contract.

b.  To avoid any conflicts with other natural resources programs, endangered species, wetlands, or the flying mission of the Air Force, the Rangeland Specialist will approve all haul roads and trailer locations.  The Rangeland Specialist will also determine which stand will be harvested first and the harvesting order of the other stands.  Harvesting or starting of work may be restricted to certain periods time to coincide with the natural resources management program or the military mission of the Air Force Range.  Harvesting can only be conducted Monday through Thursday.  Work may temporarily be halted or the contract terminated if a conflict, deemed serious by the Base Rangeland Specialist, occurs or was unforeseen.   If the contract is terminated through no fault of the contractor, the complete bid deposit submitted by the contractor shall be refunded.

c.  All environmentally sensitive areas shall be avoided by all of the contractor's operations.  No activity of any sort shall be allowed by the contractor within the areas as designated on the attached map.  The Base Rangeland Specialist will identify the boundaries of these sensitive areas prior to initiation of work.

d.  All work shall be accomplished by the contractor's personnel and with the contractor's equipment and materials.  All equipment needed for native seed harvesting operations shall be furnished, transported, and maintained by the contractor.

e.  At all times when operations are in progress, the contractor shall have a representative readily available in the area who will be authorized to receive, on behalf of the contractor, any notices or instructions given by the Air Force in regard to performance under this contract.  He shall also have a copy of the map and technical provisions on the site at all times.

TP-05.  INSPECTION: All work is subject to inspection by the Air Force both during and after the contractor's operation.  Unsatisfactory work shall be corrected promptly.

TP-06.  DAMAGE TO AIR FORCE PROPERTY: Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid damaging trees, shrubs, roads, bridges, culverts, fences, utility lines, buildings, or other structures.  Any associated debris accumulated  from the harvest operations shall not be left in roads, trails, ditches, disc lines, or fire breaks.  Air Force property damaged beyond normal wear and tear shall be replaced at the original condition as directed, at no expense to the Air Force. All repairs will be inspected and accepted or rejected by the Air Force. The damage to haul roads while standing water is present or road surfaces are soft from moisture will not be considered as normal wear and tear.

TP-07.  NEW CONSTRUCTION: All new construction by the contractor or subcontractor must be approved by the Air Force before construction begins.

TP-08.  FOREST FIRE SUPPRESSION: The contractor shall exercise due diligence both independently and in cooperation with the Air Force and will take all reasonable and practical action to prevent and suppress forest fires on the contract area or vicinity.  The contractor agrees to reimburse the Air Force for the cost of fire suppression incurred as a result of his negligence and/or willful acts.  All fires shall be reported immediately to the Base Rangeland Specialist.

TP-09.  EXAMINATION OF PREMISES: Bidders are expected to satisfy themselves as to the general location that may affect the cost of performance under this contract.  It is considered impractical to determine by other means the exact nature of the work, site conditions under which the work is to be performed, product breakdown and total quantity to be harvested.  The submission of a bid will be considered as certification that the site has been inspected and the nature of work and the effects of existing and/or adjacent work has been determined.  Inspection of the sites is invited between 8:00 AM. and 3:00 P.M., Monday through Friday (legal holidays excluded), by arrangements with the Base Rangeland Specialist, telephone  (863-452-4119, extension 305).

TP-10.  TRASH AND REFUSE: Trash and refuse resulting from the contractor's operations shall either be removed daily and disposed of on the installation at locations and in a manner as directed by the Base Rangeland Specialist or be carried out by the contractor.  No trash of any sort (tires, oil buckets, etc.) shall be left on the ground at the end of the day.

TP-11.  PAYMENT AND BIDDING:

a.  The basis for payment is pounds of native seed material. Payment shall be made weekly.  A check made payable to the "Treasury of the United States" along with invoice tickets shall be submitted to 347 RQW, DET 1, OL A/CEVN, 29 South Boulevard, Avon Park Air Force Range, Florida 33825-5700, Attention: R. Scott Penfield.

b.  All seed will be air dried for at least 5 days before it is weighed at the Avon Park Air Force Range.  All seed will be weighed by a representative of the Air Force before it is taken off the installation.

TP-12.  UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE: The contractor is cautioned that unexploded
ordnance and unburned flares may exist within the contract areas.  The contractor shall assume full responsibility for such property and shall discharge the Government from any and all damages directly and indirectly resulting from such property.  The contractor also agrees to hold the Government harmless from any and all claims arising therefrom or incident thereto.  When found, these objects shall not be tampered with or removed.  The contractor shall immediately report these findings to the Base Rangeland Specialist so proper identification and disposal can be made by the Government.

 

TP-13.  COMPLETION:
a.  The Base Rangeland Specialist shall notify the Contracting Officer when all operations required under this contract are satisfactorily completed.  In the event that the contractor is unable to complete removal of all native seed material designated for removal under this contract, the Rangeland Specialist may, if in his opinion the contractor made diligent effort to complete harvesting, recommend an extension of the contact as specified in Paragraph TP-03c.

b.  All equipment, supplies, etc., belonging to or used by the contractor or subcontractor shall be removed from the Avon Park Air Force Range within 10 days after completion of work.  Rent will be charged at the rate of $20.00 per day per piece of equipment after the 10-day period has expired.  The contractor shall also reimburse the Air Force for the removal of supplies, etc., left by the contractor after this 10-day period.
