<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 617-04-001 to implement follow-on 44-month Strengthening Decentralization in Uganda II (SDU II) activity. Local governments in Uganda, though in place and functioning, cannot fully perform all the responsibilities and duties devolved to them.  This situation is further complicated by disconnects between the various planning and budgeting processes, as well as the lack of a strong interface between local governments and various elements of the community. Local governments lack capacity to forge sectoral commitments for economic growth and social services, to respond to new allocation formulas under the Fiscal Decentralization System for resource flows to the districts, and to join stakeholders to a political process for effective planning and budgeting. Increasing local revenue generation to meet rising local government staff and services needs involves a parallel challenge to Local governments to engage communities and key tax and fee payers. And, with rising opportunity for corruption in their ranks, local government must adapt to a new set of harmonized regulations for local procurement and to organize the work of Local Tender Boards so as to assure public transparency. Success in addressing these problems will make local governments trusted agents in the redistribution of Central Government transfers, as well as locally generated revenue. USAID has already invested greatly in establishing a strategic framework and creating the enabling processes to support decentralization.  We now move into a critical period in which lessons learned must be applied to the broad base of local government across the country. USAID has identified a select set of critical areas for active engagement which include: planning and budgeting for fiscal decentralization, local procurement processes (including anti corruption), local revenue generation and  support of key USAID sectoral priorities at the local level, specifically HIV/AIDS, Health and Education,  and 2. enabling activities that strengthen community and Community Based  Organization (CBO) linkages with local government, provide effective tools for management, capacity building and service delivery and ultimately contribute to expansion of  the democratic base of local governance. We anticipate issuing the RFP approximately (15-19) days from this Synopsis posting.

IT IS BEING REISSUED AS NO RESPONSIVE BIDDERS WERE RECEIVED.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces:  Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of improved quality of primary education, with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are: (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performance based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $23m with an additional $5.6 pending.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE).

The proposed new contract requires the contractor to perform basic custodial services in the Base Medical Clinics, the Child Development Centers, the Base Fitness Centers, and general commercial-type office facilities.  Custodial services required involve three types of standards:  quality standards, frequency standards, and performance standards.  Quality standards require that appropriate surfaces are free of dirt, debris, lint, smudges, streaks, etc.  Frequency standards require cleaning tasks to be performed at certain times, i.e., weekly, twice weekly, three times weekly, etc.  Performance standards are based on the number of defects permitted before a service is considered unsatisfactory. In all Medical facilities the required cleaning will be in accordance with the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) (www.apic.org) and the American Society for Healthcare Environmental Services (ASHES) (www.ashes.org).  These two organizations pretty much write the prescriptive commonly accepted housekeeping practice guidelines for the healthcare industry.  All potential contractors will have experience in or knowledge of generally accepted healthcare industry housekeeping/cleaning practices.    Immunizations, health screening, and personnel background investigations will be required of employees working in all Medical and Child Development Centers.  At this time, Child Development Centers, Fitness Centers, and all office facilities total approximately 912,089 square feet and are located at LAAFB in El Segundo, Lawndale and San Pedro, CA.  All Medical facilities total approximately 53,563 square feet and are located at LAAFB in El Segundo and San Pedro, CA.  Any resulting contract will be subject to U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determination 94-2047 (Revision 22) dated 10Sep2002 (most current revision will be issued at RFP release).  The NAICS Code 561720 – Janitorial Services is applicable to this acquisition.  The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed Price with Indefinite Quantity CLINs type contract with a base period of performance of 12 months and up to four (4) one-year options.  The anticipated award date is 08Sep2003.  The 61ABG/CE Acquisition Team is planning to hold Industry Days from 08-09Jul2003 at LAAFB, 2420 Vela Way, Bldg 212, 1st Floor Conference room, near the intersection of El Segundo Blvd and Aviation Streets in El Segundo, CA.  The Industry Day will include a Government presentation of the work to be performed and conduct a one-on-one question and answer period along with a tour of several high visible areas that will be included in this contract. The one-on-one discussions are to permit interested contractors an opportunity to provide the Government with feedback to questionnaires provided to industry and inputs to the proposed acquisition.  Interested parties are requested to have prepared responses to the Government questions in narrative or chart format at the One-on-One sessions.  Contractors considering teaming arrangements are encouraged to bring teammates to the Industry Day session.    The solicitation for a proposal will follow and a contract will be awarded based on information submitted in response to the requested documentation identified in the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Persons attending the Industry Day/One-on-Ones must provide two forms of picture identification for entry to LAAFB and their vehicles may be searched prior to entry onto the base.  Interested contractors shall contact Marla P. Jordan, via FAX:  310-363-5499 or e-mail: marla.jordan@losangeles.af.mil, not later than 02Jul2003, or Mrs. Lavern M.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a contract on a sole-source basis to the Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems at Goleta, California to procure an Aerosol Polarimetric Sensor (APS) instrument.  This procurement includes development of the APS instrument requirements, instrument interface requirements, preliminary and detailed designs, instrument development, assembly, test, and delivery.  The APS has been designated to fly on the Glory mission, which is scheduled to launch in December 2006.  Delivery of the APS instrument is required in March 2006.	In the framework of Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI), the APS shall determine the global distribution of natural and anthropogenic aerosols (BC, sulfates, etc.) with accuracy and coverage sufficient for a reliable quantification of the aerosol effect on climate, the anthropogenic component of this effect, and the long-term change of this effect caused by natural and anthropogenic factors. The APS shall determine the effect of aerosols on clouds and precipitation and its natural and anthropogenic components. The APS instrument shall be compatible with the NASA algorithm suite in order to measure: Aerosol optical thickness; Aerosol particle size distribution; Aerosol refractive index, single-scatter albedo and shape; Liquid cloud optical thickness and particle size distribution. Furthermore, the APS instrument shall be a proof of concept and risk reduction for Integrated Program Office (IPO) APS to fly on the NPOESS platform currently scheduled for launch in 2010.  The NASA APS instrument will have similar volume, mass and power requirements to those specified under NPOESS.  These requirements include volume of 70"x70"x50", mass of 50 kg, and power of 45 watts.   The APS must measure polarization and radiance to an accuracy of 0.2% and 4% respectively for nine measurement bands that include 412, 488, 555, 672, 910, 865, 1378,1610, 2250 nm.  The 488 nm is specifically needed for over-water retrievals to measure chlorophyll accurately and thus unambiguously separate the surface contribution to the radiance and polarization from the atmospheric scatterers, the 910 nm band is dedicated to measure water vapor, and the 1378 nm band is dedicated to detection of cirrus clouds.	The remaining bands are necessary for fully measuring and characterizing the aerosols.  In particular the wide range, from 412 to 2250 nm is necessary to understand size distributions and to establish the fraction of aerosols that are absorbing rather than reflecting.  The instrument must be an along-track instrument in order to generate the needed angles for the polarization studies and must have a minimum nadir pixel size of about 6 kilometers diameter in order not to be overly sensitive to cloud cover. It must measure the linear polarization degree and its direction as well as the total radiance.  The above elements of the APS instrument must be developed in order to assure compatibility with the NASA algorithm suite that has been developed to support the Research Sensor Polarimeter (RSP), an aircraft version of the APS. NASA/GSFC intends to procure the APS instrument from Raytheon based upon 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  Only Raytheon has the heritage to build, integrate, and test the APS instrument to meet the scientific requirements and the Glory mission schedule.  However, companies that believe they can provide an APS for the Glory mission without any detrimental impact to the instrument delivery and launch schedules should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis on the NAIS or Commerce Business Daily.  These capability statements will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this instrument procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses to the synopsis received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement on a full and open basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.	See Note 22.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nnotes.htm  .   An Ombudsman has been appointed, See Internet Note “B”.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public Architectural-Engineering for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for replacement of Electrical and Mechanical components, the replacement of the existing fire alarm system, elevator modernization and upgrades to the handicap accessibility. The design must comply with General Services Administration (GSA) quality standards and requirements.  The facility is approximately 705,347 gross square feet. It is composed of two structures located on a city block bounded by Poydras and Lafayette Streets on the north and south and Magazine and Camp Streets on the east and west. The Courthouse is a six story structure and the Federal Building is a fourteen story structure. Both structures share a common basement that encompasses the outer limits of each.  GSA Greater Southwest Region, Solicitation No. GS-07P-04-UUC-0001 – The Estimated Construction Cost range is between $15 to 25 million.  The facility was designed by Mathes, Bergman and Associates, Inc. in association with August Perez and Associates, Inc. and was completed with substantial occupancy in early 1976.. The unique aspects of the architecture of this period should be considered. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS). Included in the design is the refurbishing of  the main electrical equipment, which includes the switch gear and the motor control centers (MCC), and replacement of two transformers on each floor. The design shall also include the replacement of 56 Air Handling Units (AHUs), the conversion of five floors with multi zone air distribution systems with variable air volume air distribution systems, the modernization of all elevators,  replacement of the fire alarm system with a completely new fire alarm system, and upgrading the facility handicap accessibility features to meet current code requirements.

<SOLNBR>N0001403R0015
<RESPDATE>080603
<ARCHDATE>11252003
<CONTACT>Wade Wargo, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2574, Email wargow@onr.navy.mil - Susan Sutherland, Branch Head ONR Code 251, Phone 703-696-4601, Email suthers@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for the Phase 2 development of the Electronic Warfare Integrated System for Small Platforms (EWISSP) program.  This notice is to announce the Office of Naval Research’s (ONR) release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the design, development, fabrication, integration and test and evaluation of the EWISSP.  The EWISSP program is a joint Government/Industry effort.  The EWISSP concept is to develop a highly integrated and compact EW system to protect small platforms.  EWISSP will develop a family of sensor and countermeasure subsystems with applications to a variety of small platforms that have little or no self-protection against smart weapons or munitions.  EWISSP will provide a combination of Radio Frequency (RF), Infrared (IR), and Laser sensors to detect threats against platforms operating in the Littorals.  EWISSP sensors will detect emitters to provide situation awareness, hostile intent and cueing of countermeasures.  EWISSP countermeasures will include combinations of onboard and offboard RF, IR, and Laser responses that contribute to both self-protection as well as countermeasures against threat targeting and surveillance sensors to disrupt, dilute, confuse, and defeat the enemy’s ability to launch effective attacks against amphibious forces.  The objective is to improve platform survivability by providing an EW system for self-protection as well as a system that is integrated in a network centric environment to allow the netting of sensors and countermeasures among the various units deployed on a specific mission.  

This RFP will provide for award of an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contract(s).  The contract will have a five-year ordering period.  The initial task order is for the design, development, fabrication, integration and test of an EWISSP on an Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV) developed by the Marine Corps.  This initial task order will have a four-year period of performance.   Future task orders under this contract could include work to support Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decisions, including production engineering, preparation of production documentation and qualification testing, and the tasking for the actual production and testing of limited quantities of system/subsystems, i.e., LRIP, for installation on the AAAV.   This IDIQ contract will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR and the Marine Corp's AAAV Program Office.  ONR anticipates the basic contract will have a maximum ordering ceiling of $75M.   Funding of $15-20M is anticipated to be made available for the initial task order.

The solicitation will be made available on the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_03_r_0015/ on approximately 18 JUN 2003.  No hardcopies of this RFP will be mailed, faxed, or emailed.  In order to submit a proposal under this solicitation, Offerors must possess a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The RFP will be unclassified, but the System Requirements Document (SRD) will be classified Secret and therefore will be provided under separate cover.  The SRD will only be provided to interested Offerors who have a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The SRD will be mailed in hardcopy or on CD ROM to Offerors upon request via the following methods: Mail to Office of Naval Research, Ballston Centre Tower One, Attn: Wade Wargo, ONR 251, 800 N. Quincy Street, Rm. 720, Arlington, VA, 22217-5660; Email to wargow@onr.navy.mil; or Fax to 703-696-0066.  All requests should include RFP Number, Company Cage Code, Facility address, and Request Point of Contact information.  Requests for the SRD can be sent immediately after publication of this synopsis.  Additional classified background documentation will be made available to Offerors for viewing at the Naval Research Laboratory weekdays from 0900 to 1500 (local time) starting on the date of RFP issuance until the due date for proposals.  Interested Offerors should consult the ONR website (http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_03_r_0015/) around the approximate date of RFP issuance for further instructions on how to visit NRL to view this information.

An Industry Day is tentatively scheduled for Friday, 27 JUN 2003 at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), 4555 Overlook Avenue SW Washington, DC 20375-5326 in Building 210, Conference Room 1440.  The security level will be SECRET. Visit Requests will need to be received by 16 JUN 2003 for a 27 JUN 2003 Industry Day.  Offerors interested in attending industry date should consult the ONR website for further information and to confirm final date and times of Industry Day.

<CONTACT>John C. Piunno 202-781-3912 John C. Piunno 202-781-3912
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to contract with Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems, 1847 West Main Road, Portsmouth, Rhode Island, on a sole source basis for (1) final development of a MK 29 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) Ordnance Alteration (ORDALT) kit and (2) production of a limited number of associated MK 29 ORDALT kits.  These ORDALT kits upgrade the legacy MK 29 GMLS, which is part of the MK 57 NATO SEASPARROW Surface Missile System (NSSMS), allowing the MK 29 GMLS to launch the Evolved SEASPARROW Missile (ESSM) in lieu of the existing RIM-7 missile.  During the ESSM development test program,  Raytheon developed the MK29 upgrades which will be used to finish development of this ORDALT and is the only known firm possessing the requisite technical expertise, engineering background and facilities necessary for performing the effort in a timely manner, while mitigating any impact to the US Navy's ESSM deployment requirements. The MK 29 ORDALT contemplated consists of:  (1) mechanical modifications to the launcher to accommodate ESSM space and weight requirements; (2) electrical modifications to the launcher, Maintenance Interconnecting Cabinet (MIC), and MK57 to MIC interface; (3) programming and firmware modifications to the MK108 Guided Missile Launch Controller;  (4) modifications to the MK 29 SERVO systems; and, (5) development of associated documentation and technical data for the ORDALT.   While a single contract is contemplated, the procurement of this requirement may be accomplished using primarily a new contract with a separate contract order to initiate necessary preliminary engineering tasks.  The contract(s) will include:  (1) engineering and development necessary to complete the prototype MK 29 ORDALT; (2)  production of MK 29 ORDALT kits for installation on one aircraft carrier (with options for additional kits for installation on one aircraft carrier and one LHD Class ship);  (3) production of a MK 29 ORDALT kit for the MK 57 NSSMS land based test site (LBTS);  and, (4) may include MK 29 ORDALT kits and associated equipment for other US Navy requirements as may be authorized or appropriated by Congress, as well as requirements for other NSSMS participating countries as may be determined by the NATO SEASPARROW Project Steering Committee (NSPSC). Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>1.0.  DESCRIPTION 1.1.  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is issuing this Request for Information announcement N00039-04-R-0002 on behalf of the Program Executive Officer ? Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence and Space (PEO-C4I), Program Management Warfare 176 (PMW 176). 1.2.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  The intent is to identify sources that can design and implement a method to collect and analyze battlegroup communications metrics. 1.3.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party?s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. 1.4.  If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 2.0.  BACKGROUND 2.1.  The PEO-C4I, PMW 176 is seeking sources capable of designing and producing a method of gathering and analyzing battlegroup communications information and developing metrics suitable for identifying efficiency issues. The metrics must have sufficient detail to allow them to be used to identify opportunities to improve warfighting capacity, including locating shortfalls or excess capacity.  This request for information (RFI) seeks responses that will be used in developing a contract specification for battlegroup metrics development, installation, and execution. 2.2.  The Navy desires to examine all wideband satellite communications (SATCOM) into or out of a battlegroup during a full deployment to determine actual communications usage.  Wideband SATCOM Systems included in this metric are Commercial Wideband SATCOM Program (CWSP) (formerly known as the Challenge Athena Program), Extremely High Frequency (EHF), Global Broadcast System (GBS), International Maritime Satellite System (INMARSAT), Super High Frequency (SHF), and Television - Direct To Sailors (TV-DTS).  It is anticipated that some applications will be employed so much that they will be bandwidth limited while others may not be used to capacity.  The metrics are intended to capture this information to allow the Navy to realign communications plans to make optimum use of available resources and to plan rationally for future improvements. A battlegroup can be assumed to consist of one aircraft carrier (CVN), two cruisers (CG), two guided missile destroyers (DDG), two attack submarines (SSN), one amphibious helicopter carrier (LHA), and two amphibious docks (LHD).  A battlegroup deployment is approximately six months long.  The metrics should consider the following characteristics: 2.2.1.  Type of Information ? For example:  Voice, Video, Data, Imagery. 2.2.2.  Applications ? For example:  email, GCCS-M, LAWS, etc. 2.2.3.  Users ? For example:  CIC, JIC, CDC, TFCC, SUPPLOT, SACC, LFOC, JFACC, personal use by individual Sailors, etc. 2.2.4.  Security Classification - For example: SCI, Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, FOUO, Unclassified. 3.0.   REQUESTED INFORMATION 3.1.  White Paper 3.1.1.  Commercial companies and other organizations are hereby invited to provide a white paper, of no more than thirty (30) pages in length, on their satellite communications experience, Battlegroup Communications Metric concepts and technologies, and previous demonstrations of, and/or capabilities to develop technologies to support the capabilities desired for the Battlegroup Communications Metric.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence and Space (PEO-C4I), Advanced Automated Tactical Communications Program Office PMW 179 is seeking information on how multi-vendor teams could be established and managed to provide a successful collaborative effort under the Increment III Phase of the ADNS program. The Navy is seeking information on the best method to transform the Navy's current Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and Advanced Digital Multiplexing System (ADMS) from a partially serial data and partially Internet Protocol (IP) data system to an all IP system.  The Navy anticipates a Contract Award in the late 2005 timeframe to procure a Systems Architecture that will have as a primary objective to converge all current voice, video, and data circuits to a "Native" IP Network. It is anticipated that the system maximizes the use of currently available COTS and NDI components into an integrated network design. To encourage the participation of innovative companies that do not traditionally supply technology to the government, the Navy is prepared to purchase prototypes outside of the Federal Acquisition Regulations via Other Transactions Authority, if applicable. The entire Request for Information is at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil Click on Headquarters; then Future Opportunities; then click on N00039-04-R-0003 for the entire announcement which is attached as a Microsoft Word document.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis, software system design, development, analysis, and maintenance services in support of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) system of the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) of the U. S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Suffolk, VA.  The requirement is for twelve months of services, anticipated to commence 1 January 2004, with two option years.

The mission of JWFC is to provide a training environment where Joint Task Force Commanders can learn to develop and implement joint force doctrine, tactics, and procedures in a realistic facility, using computer-simulated scenarios instead of actual troop deployment.  JWFC supports Mission Integration and Rehearsals for assigned forces, where tactics and procedures are developed and practiced in the event of a real-world crisis.  The requirements of this acquisition focus on the continued design, development, analysis, and maintenance of the JTLS system, as well as exercise database tests and technical support during exercise execution.  The JTLS is an interactive, computer-assisted simulation system that models multi-sided air, ground, and naval combat, with the purpose of evaluating contingency operations plans to determine if such plans would in fact accomplish the mission envisioned by military and political planners and doctrinaires.

The JTLS configuration is the only software system that meets the technological requirements of the Joint Training Program mission.  The acquisition is being processed on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition, sole source to Rolands & Associates Corporation, 500 Sloat Ave., Monterey, CA 93940-3535 under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of providing the required support of the JTLS system, as this firm designed and developed the JTLS and has been the only source that has made continuous functional and system upgrades since system implementaion in 1983. Furthermore, as this acquisition requires the provision to the Government of any and all changes to system software modules, including source code, Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.        

All other responsible sources may submit concise documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services, as well as financial and technical information.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Furthermore, no contract award will be made on the basis of information received in response to this notice and the Navy will not pay for any information provided.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, to the attention of W. A. Woodring, Code 02P22B, and reference Solicitation N00140-04-R-H008.  If no affirmative written responses advantageous to the Navy are received by close of business on the twelfth (12) calendar day after publication of this notice, Rolands & Associates Corporation will be solicited, pursuant to FAR 12.203, to provide the required services.  The placement of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract is contemplated, with services performed at the contractor’s facilities and Government facilities located in Suffolk, VA.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 514210.

If a competitive solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published.  Any such solicitation will be issued to the intended vendor and all firms that respond to this synopsis of intent or otherwise request a copy of the solicitation.  A letter requesting a copy of the solicitation should be mailed to the above address or telefaxed to 215-697-9738, Attn: Bid Room, Code 02P52.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at the Navy Electronic Commerce Office (NECO) web address: http://neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) requires a new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) system to provide communications for Officer Safety and Institutional Operations at 21 institutions. The FBOP anticipates awarding a sole source contract to Motorola using a firm fixed-price requirements type contract.  This procurement is needed to fulfill a Congressional mandate.  The mandate requires that all radio systems must operate within narrowband specifications established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  For the FBOP, this mandate requires all existing VHF radio systems to be replaced with UHF trunked radio systems by January 1, 2005, for all 21 institutions.  The FBOP currently uses a Motorola “Smartnet” infrastructure and subscriber units to meet their communications needs.  The proposed equipment must be compatible with FBOP’s existing Land Mobile Radio (LMR) assets at 65 institutions so that LMR resources can be redistributed nationwide in emergency situations.  Included in this trunked radio system is the requirement that all radios and body alarms must operate on the 3600 baud control channel and operate in a UHF  406-420 MHz band.  FBOP requires a “turnkey” effort to include the system design, the furnishing of equipment, site preparation, complete systems integration, installation, testing, training, warranty, and maintenance support.  The system must have a flexible infrastructure design and a modular architecture to readily accommodate future expansion of repeaters, talkgroups, dispatch console positions, conventional nets, and subscribers.  The system shall be software upgradable to incorporate future technology.  The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  The system must support dispatch console operator positions and system management equipment. The radio system shall incorporate a dispatch console sub-system that will allow FBOP personnel to access any voice channel on the system.  The dispatch consoles shall be PC based, use a standard operating system and operate in a standard Ethernet LAN environment.  The console shall incorporate fault tolerant electronics and shall accept software updates to refresh its technology.  The dispatch positions and the trunked system infrastructure shall be linked via dedicated phone lines.  Should additional console positions be required in the future, the system shall be able to accommodate them.  The dispatch consoles must utilize a touch screen display, with at least a 20 inch screen measured diagonally.  Since Motorola was the provider of the trunked radio systems at the 65 institutions previously installed, they are the only provider capable of supplying the compatible trunked radio system at the remaining 21 institutions and within the January 1, 2005, time frame mandated by Congress.  The FBOP anticipates issuing a solicitation on or around November 1.  All interested and responsible sources capable of providing the equipment/services aforementioned should notify Jan Johns, Senior Contract Specialist, by faxing a letter to (202) 307-1146.  Questions related to this synopsis should be addressed to Jan Johns at (202) 307-0985.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC at Picatinny, NJ has a requirement to procure a quantity of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) .22 caliber rimfire ammunition containing lead-free projectiles. There are four types of ammunition being requested: Type 1-  Cartridge, Caliber .22, Standard Velocity for Rifle Type 2	- Cartridge, Caliber .22, High Velocity for Rifle Type 3 - Cartridge, Caliber .22, Match Grade for Rifle Type 4 - Cartridge, Caliber .22, Match Grade for Pistol The Contractor will provide 15,000 rounds for each type of ammunition listed. It is the Contractor’s choice to only submit one type, a combination of types, or all types for a maximum of 60,000 rounds. The Government will qualify and test against performance specification (MIL-PRF- 70600A).  Along with this requirement, the projectiles of these rounds must be 100% lead-free and free of all other contaminants that would render the spent projectiles as hazardous waste or any other waste that would require regulatory cleanup to ranges or other areas.  These projectiles must not leach toxins into the environment and must prove to be environmentally friendly to flora and fauna.  This is not a request for cost/ technical proposals at this time, and will result in no future obligation to the Government.   A formal Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued at a future date.  The procurement will be a full and open competition, and any Proposals received in response to the RFP will be evaluated on a Best Value basis, resulting in single or multiple contractor awards.

<ARCHDATE>02022004
<CONTACT>Gayle McClelland, 757-878-4818
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), Aviation Research, Development, and Engineering Center is soliciting technical and cost proposals on an exploratory development effort called Unmanned Autonomous Collaborative Operations, Part 1 (ACO). Pr oposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this re quirement other than this announcement. Multiple awards during second quarter FY 04 are anticipated and awards may be staggered.  The Unmanned Autonomous Collaborative Operation program will be conducted in two parts.  This BAA solicits proposals for Part 1 only.  Part 1 is exploratory development intended to develop high-value militarily relevant UAV behaviors and demonstrate a selected subset in flight.  A separate solicitation for Part 2 will be issued in FY05. Part 2 is intended to develop all behaviors required to demonstrate UAVs collaborating with other manned and unmanned assets in a cooperative engagement scenario relevant to Future Combat System (F CS) Unit of Action operations.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVE: is to develop and demonstrate militarily relevant mission behavior among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cooperating on tasks and sharing information as necessary to accomplish assigned objectives as part of a manned/unmanned t eam.    PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: The ACO program will include design, development, simulation and flight demonstration of autonomous collaborative behaviors using unmanned air vehicle assets owned or arranged for by the Contractor. No Government Furnished UAVs will b e available. Surrogates for fielded or in-development UAVs are acceptable. Desired types of mission behaviors include: 'See & Avoid' cooperative flight, Avenge kill/team protection, Cooperative reconnaissance/Security, Adjustment to component failures as a team, Network adaptation for assured communications, Surveillance on several moving targets in urban terrain,  Establishment of multiple optimum observation points,  Twin Lift, Unmanned Supply Sustainment, See the Supplemental Information Link ( http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/Save/CDRL.zip ) for further explanation of these titles and dimensions of interest.  A single offeror is not expected to demonstrate all behaviors under its program, but demon stration of two or more mission behaviors is required within an offerors proposal and complete coverage of the list is an objective of the government among all awardees. Offerors may modify or tailor these behaviors to their particular capabilities, or pro pose alternatives. Flight demonstration(s), using Contractor furnished or arranged air vehicles shall be proposed as a separately priced option(s). Under the optional flight demonstration, offerors should propose to flight demonstrate at least one behavior . However, each behavior proposed for flight demonstration must be separately priced.. Key elements of technology development anticipated within this ACO effort include the achievement of high degrees of individual UAV flight and mission autonomy, multi-ve hicle, multi-class UAV collaboration, development of requirements for the data links, protocols, sensors, and processing software to enable intra vehicle and controller communication, and human-system interfaces which support multiple levels of supervisory  control.  Development of interfaces and subsystem requirements should be done only to the extent necessary to enable mission autonomy and collaboration objectives.  Where practical, systems (software) architecture needs to be developed that produces and o r supports behaviors that are distributable and scalable over the different UAV class sizes and sensor packages.  Simulated airborne control of the unmanned systems is encouraged, but not required under this solicitation.  DELIVERABLES: During the program,  Contractors will deliver software, data, and reports.  Minimum deliverables shall be: (1) Management/Program Plan, (2) Performance/Cost-Scientific/Technical Reports, (3) Interface Design/Control Document, (4) Operational/Functional Requirement Document, (5) System Architecture Design and Specifications, (6) Computer Software Product End Items, (7) Simulation Software and Interface Design/Control Document, (8) Final Report. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Unclassified, subject to export controls. Notice to Foreign Owned Firms:  Participation in this program is limited to US companies. OTHER SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:  The government desires to obtain unlimited data rights to the Interface Control Documents (ICDs), final report and all associated ACO demonstration results.  The government desires to obtain at least Government Purpose Rights t o all other technical data and software deliverables. However, DFARS clause 252.227-7017 Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, is included by reference in this announcement.  This clause requires an offeror to identify t echnical data and computer software that the offeror anticipates it will furnish the Government during performance of any contract or agreement with restrictive rights.  The offeror must include as an attachment to its proposal the assertion required by th is clause identifying any data and/or software subject to restrictions on use and the basis for the assertion.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Anticipated Period of Performance:  28 months  Anticipated Award Date:  March 2004 Government funding planned = $13.2M (Total, not per contract) Distribution:  FY04 29%, FY05 52%, FY06 18% Government Furnished Property:  None.  Government Furnished Information: (furnished upon contract award) MUM Teaming Experimentation Reports, RPA Final Report, ICD for Virtual Autonomous Team Tool (VATT) UAV API and ICD for VATT Autonomy Logic API. Contractor Furnished Property: Simulation Facility and UAVs for purposes of executing SOW tasks.  NOTE: Offerors should examine AR 95-20 and assess whether they wish to comply, seek waivers through the applicable Government Flight Representative or elimina te all risk of loss of or damage to aircraft to the Government and therefore render AR 95-20 inapplicable.  Offers shall specifically state their choice of alternative, and how they intend to maintain regulatory compliances/waiver/non-applicability within contract SOW/schedule.  Type of Contractual Vehicle: The Government seeks to maximize industry participation and anticipates making several awards. A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending on the proposed effort, the entity submitting  the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy. Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented; technology investment agreements for purpose  of support/stimulation, subject to 10 U.S.C. 2358 or 10 U.S.C. 2371; and other transaction agreements subject to 10 U.S.C. 2371 and Section 845 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act, as amended. Contract type is a subject for negotiation.

PSC Military Housing Company (PCSMHC), acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Combat Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. local time 13 November 2003, at the offices of PSCMHC. PSCMHC intends to employ a two-step RFP process. In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Nellis AFB project. PSCMHC, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Nellis project in accordance with the RFP.  Up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals in the second step. PSCMHC will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Government. The Nellis Project involves the construction of 815 units, renovation of 363 units and the demolition of 915 existing units during the initial transition period and the replacement of 350 units in the outyears. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,278 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government expects to contribute leased real property and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Nellis family housing inventory.

[The concept, based on performance, is that successful Small Businesses (SBs) would have an opportunity to compete for  additional requirements.  When successfully executed, the percentage of dollars awarded to SB firms should increase over the life of the contract(s)]; (4) Task Order awards, to include Section 803 of Public Law 107-107 competition requirements and Fair Op portunity; (5) Price Evaluation Techniques; (6) Geographical coverage; (7)  Other pertinent information.

FAR  Clause 52.215-3 “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes  (October 1997) is incorporated into this RFI by reference. ///signed/// SALLY L. MEYER Contracting Officer Attachments: 1.Key Performance Parameters 2.System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters 3.Additional Technical Information Requested NOTE:  The Industry Day attendance roster, minutes, and questions from 9-29-03  will be posted the week of 6-10 October.   ///UPDATE END/// UPDATE (9-23-03)  Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

Submissions are due no later than 2:00 pm on Friday, November 7, 2003 to the GSA Contracting Officer at: General Services Administration, Mr. Steve Farrington (8PF), P.O. Box 25546, Denver, CO 80225-0546.  No late submissions will be accepted unless the U.S. Postal Service Postmarks them at least two days prior to the due date.

Interview Parameters

The following parameters for the interview process are established to ensure maximum utilization of the available time and to focus on responses to critical topics.  
	·	Because of time limitations and the need to focus on critical issues, the A/E Team’s representation may not exceed five individuals: Lead Designer (attendance mandatory), Architectural Project Manager (attendance mandatory), Associated Architect (if proposed, attendance mandatory), Mechanical Project Manager (attendance mandatory), Electrical Project Manager (attendance mandatory).
	·	The interview process is intended to evoke a response to the critical design objectives and the A/E Team’s approach to manage and deliver the project successfully.  The A/E Team’s presentation should respond to the enclosed Stage II evaluation criteria recognizing the interview time constraints.
	·	Presentation aids should be limited to a graphic presentation using boards or projected images.  The A/E Team must provide its own easels and/or projectors as required.  Supplementary handouts that expand upon information covered in the presentations are NOT allowed.  Reduced format copies of presentation material are not required but may be distributed, if desired.  Since the interview schedule is very structured, strict adherence to the time allotment is mandatory.  The setup and breakdown of presentation aids should be simple to endure the best use of the presentation time.


Interviews Issues

1.	Functional Requirements
Major renovations in occupied buildings pose a unique challenge to a design team.  In addition to meeting the Architectural, Mechanical, and Electrical requirements of the project, specific care must be taken with regards to scheduling, phasing, and security.  In addressing these topics, the team should demonstrate a thorough knowledge of major renovation projects in occupied office space, and demonstrate how it is qualified to successfully complete a project of this size and complexity.

2.	Team
To provide the best possible service to the client, the team must have the ability to work as a cohesive, efficient, communicative whole.  The team should demonstrate how it will organize the work, integrate client input, and manage the design and documentation of the renovation project in a timely and cost-effective manner.

3.	Commitment of Lead Designer
GSA’s Design Excellence Program is setting a new standard in design for public buildings.  This program can only be successful with a primary commitment of time and energy from the Lead Designer.  The A/E Team must indicate:
·	A process where the Lead Designer plays a substantive leadership role.
·	A quality control methodology for the design.
·	A primary commitment from the Lead Designer to this project.

4.	Sustainable Design
The Government has a commitment to sustainable design.  Public buildings need to be at the forefront of sensitivity to the environment and set an example for private-sector buildings.  The Team should address the issue of sustainable design as it could pertain to this project and its past work.  Areas to be specifically addressed include energy efficiency, environmental safety, and construction waste management.

<DESC>Recently, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) awarded two multiple year contracts to procure fiber optic infrastructure to help transform the Department of Defense's Global Information Grid (GIG). The contracts are firm fixed price with a potential value of roughly $250 million for implementation and $140 million for life cycle support.   FY-03 procurement funding will be used to acquire the fiber and year-to-year O&M funding will be used to sustain the fiber.  The GIG Bandwidth Expansion (BE) requirement was published in FebBizOps in March 2003.   (A public announcement of this award is posted on the DISA website at: http://www.disa.mil under Public Affairs, Press Releases, and GIG-BE Fiber Contracts awarded.) The awarded actions do not involve Foreign Military Sales. Although most of the geographic areas of this fiber solicitation were awarded, for multiple reasons, some were not.  Currently, the Government is reviewing the underlying requirements for the unawarded areas and intends to resolicit for some or all of these requirements in a timely manner.  A secret clearance (minimum) is required to receive, store, and generate, classified information pertaining to this acquisition. The actual planned site requirements are identified in a classified Annex to the Statement of Work. The potential new fiber optic contract awards will not involve Foreign Military Sales.  Background:  The initial procurements of fiber are part of the GIG-BE initiative and are in addition to contract awards for networking equipment.  The goal of the GIG-BE is to provide a survivable, secure infrastructure for the Department of Defense.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This synopsis is being issued to conduct market research.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Mission Planning System Program Office (SPO), Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom Air Force Base, MA is developing a System Engineering and Integration Contract (SEIC) RFP for the Mission Planning Enterprise.  This Enterprise encompasses organizations in the US Air Force, Navy, Army, Marines, Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Non-US forces. The scope of this proposed contract includes mission planning system engineering and integration over the next 16 years, likely with a 4-year initial term and a series of options.  The contract scope spans technical and management tasks associated with integrating the Mission Planning Enterprise Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Framework, Common Capabilities (CCs), and Unique Planning Components (UPCs). During the initial 4-year period of performance it is anticipated that more than 87 software development activities will require SEIC management. The SEIC contractor will coordinate and communicate with many Government agencies such as Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), the 46 Test Squadron, Mission Planning and Platform Systems Program Offices and the Ogden Air Logistics Center. The SEIC contractor will have an associate contractor relationship with the Mission Planning Enterprise Contract (MPEC) contractors.  For further information on the MPEC acquisition, the MPEC Hanscom Electronic Resources Bulletin Board (HERBB) site is: https://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R484 The SEIC contractor will support the technical and management tasks associated with migration from the legacy systems to JMPS. The SEIC contractor will support the Operations, Maintenance, and Life Cycle Upgrades of the legacy Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS), Tactical Automated Mission Planning System (TAMPS), Army Mission Planning System (AMPS), and Mission Planning System (MPS).   The SEIC contractor will support the technical and management tasks associated with migration from the legacy systems to JMPS. The Mission Planning SPO is streamlining Government activities.  It is our intention to contract out other than Inherently Governmental functions under the SEIC, including: day-to-day Mission Planning program execution activities; Enterprise Integration Schedule management; contract management tasks; financial management tasks; business operations; and Mission Planning Environment management.  The SEIC contractor will develop a transition plan. The potential offeror must demonstrate in their response and prove through past performance, the ability to integrate and manage a large-scale complex software system.  For purposes of this synopsis, "large-scale" is defined to be an effort in excess of one million lines of executable computer code (executable computer code defined as counting source lines of code by semi-colon, excluding counting of comments, or by counting line numbers) distributed over more than 20 applications within a single program, where the software development was completed by third parties, and integrated by the potential offeror.  This scenario includes external systems data feeds. Under this contract the SPO provides guidance and oversight, while the potential offeror must provide: 1) system requirements analysis: working with users to define requirements; 2) architecture and design: design standards, interface documentation, performance analysis, engineering documentation (SV, OV, TV); 3) configuration management: knowledge repository, software configuration control and distribution; 4) systems integration: analysis and proposal of technical and integration alternatives, platforms baseline; 5) system evolution: roadmap, master schedule; 6) system test: proposing test plans, working with test agencies, executing and analyzing tests; and 7) management: monitoring of cost, schedule, performance, risk management, documentation, and meeting administration. The purpose of this announcement is to help the Government identify the qualifications of potential offerors as to whether they could qualify to be the SEIC prime contractor.   The Government requests interested companies submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the scope of work identified above.  Potential offerors should address the following criteria at a minimum: 1.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Acquisition Management Division (VA), 1100 Wilson Boulevard Room 2133, Arlington, VA, 22209-3939.
Description
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking sources for a fixed-price services contract to continue software development on an existing modernization project for MSHA’s information management systems.
The software development project involves the migration of several separate mainframe systems running COBOL on a Honeywell Bull mainframe and an IBM mainframe to a single, web-based application running on a UNIX platform.  The current systems support approximately 2,200 MSHA employees located in over 100 offices throughout the United States.  The systems primarily support programmatic functions as opposed to administrative functions.  The project has been ongoing for 3 years and has an established baseline production component developed by a joint contract and government personnel team.  All project activities have been conducted in the MSHA / Information Resources Center office in Lakewood, CO.  In addition to developing the new system, the project requires contract staff to train and mentor MSHA employees to ensure they have sufficient knowledge to provide user support and maintenance for the completed product.
The significant tools used in the development effort require proven expertise in Oracle; Sun Microsystems UNIX; NCR Teradata; Apache and BEA WebLogic web and application server components and framework; Rational Enterprise Suite development, configuration management, and testing tools; Rational Unified Process development methodology; J2EE development; InetSoft Style Report Writer; and Microsoft FrontPage, Office, and Internet Explorer.
Specialized technical skills that are required include requirements analysis; systems design and analysis; software languages including Java, HTML, JSP, PL/SQL, Perl, and Unix shells; data modeling; data base development; data warehouse analysis, design and development; data migration between significantly different platforms; software testing; reports development; and technical writing.
Management skills that are required include project management; capital planning; configuration management; release management; and expertise in applying Federal Information Technology management guidelines and Federal Computer Security guidelines.
Interested parties must address the following issues and questions in their response:
1.	Describe your ability to provide the required expertise in the toolsets and specialized technical and management skills, as noted above.  Is your company familiar with the suite of Rational tools?  If so, provide examples of use on similar type/scale systems.  What technologies, products, and standards does your company support?  Please describe which technology your company has the greatest strength in supporting.
2.	Describe your proposed strategy for assuming the project management and technical activities within the framework of the existing project and production baseline that minimizes unnecessary re-work of production components.  Describe how your company would transition the project from the existing contractor with particular emphasis on major milestones and your experience in transitioning large-scale systems while mitigating risks associated with the loss of intellectual capital and domain knowledge.
3.	Describe your experience in comparable projects that included a data migration effort.  Describe your software engineering methodology (e.g., Waterfall, Rapid, or RUP) and provide examples of use in legacy transformations.
4.	Describe your company's Quality Assurance and Change Management programs.  How would you apply these capabilities to the MSHA project?  What benefits would this provide to MSHA and its stakeholders?
5.	Describe your strategy for maintaining continuity of skills to mitigate staff turnover issues.
6.	Describe your proposed strategy for mentoring MSHA staff on technical products.
7.	Describe your strategy for staffing the project and proposed rates for specialized skills.  Describe how your company will manage a disparate and geographically disbursed set of stakeholders.  Does your company have an office in the Denver and/or Washington, D.C. areas?  If so, what capabilities are provided?  Please provide examples that describe your experience.  Describe how your company can assemble the appropriate mix of IT and Management resources to ensure a successful delivery.  Also, please describe how your company will marshal the necessary resources in the event of changes in scope and/or requirements.

8.	Describe your strengths in the areas of solution architecture, design, development, and implementation.
9.	Describe any relevant partnerships and/or alliances you have with technology providers/vendors.
Companies that meet the above criteria are requested to contact Robert N Beaty, Contracting Officer at beaty.robert@dol.gov or by fax at 202-693-9826 by 3:00 PM EDT October 20, 2003  Please indicate the company name, contact information, and GSA FSS contract number on your response.

<DESC>Edwards AFB is seeking interested contractor services for Performance Phase Checkride Services at the USAF Test Pilots School (TPS) located at Edwards AFB CA.
1.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The contractor shall provide aircraft flights to support the USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) Performance Phase Checkride. This will consist of approximately 11 flights of 1.6 hours duration in a 2-week period.  This event will be executed twice per year, typically near the end of March and again near the end of September.  Flight times, number of flights and period of execution will vary somewhat but will be scheduled at least 4 weeks in advance.  Also during this period, but with a lower priority, the aircraft may participate in the TPS Qualitative Evaluation Program.  Qual-eval sorties will vary in number and duration based on non-interference with the Checkride event.  The desirability of Qual-eval sorties is a function of the specific aircraft type being used for the Checkride event.  If used, up to 20 additional flying hours may be flown during each of the 2 execution periods.  The contractor shall also provide appropriately rated safety pilots and required maintenance crew for the daily operation of the aircraft from Edwards AFB.  Additional incidental support would include cockpit familiarization training, 2-hour pre-brief before each sortie, and debrief for all designated Air Force Flight Test Center personnel. Contractor shall allow an Air Force inspection team to perform an initial on-site inspection of the aircraft prior to first flight and a reoccurring aircraft inspection every two years thereafter. All Air Force Instructions (AFI’s) and Operating Instructions (OI’s) referred to in this document are available to the contractor/user through electronic media.  
2.  Historically, this Checkride was performed using a C-130 Hercules aircraft which was considered an excellent platform.  Certain characteristics of the C-130 are required to execute the Checkride and others, though not required, are desired to increase learning effectiveness of the sortie.  The aircraft must have sufficient room in the cockpit or flight deck for the pilot student to be in a control seat.  An appropriately qualified contractor pilot will also be in a control seat, preferably in the second-in-command position.  Also in the cockpit or on the flight deck will be two TPS faculty evaluators for grading purposes.  The evaluators must be in a position to directly observe the actions and easily communicate with the students. The aircraft should be a type that is generally unfamiliar to the students.  A highly desired characteristic of the C-130 was the ability to safely shut down an engine in flight so certain flight test techniques (FTTs) could be flown in a configuration that significantly altered performance and required the students to manage new test limits and configuration changes.  The TPS Performance Branch Chief, Director of Student Training, and Director of Operations will evaluate the make and model of the aircraft to be used for suitability.  Suitability criteria are based upon TPS curriculum objectives.  
3.  Registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database is required prior to award of any contract with the government.  CCR registration can be done at 
http: //www.ccr.gov/.  For a copy of the DRAFT statement of work contact John Aguilar, Contracting Officer at 661-277-8884, fax 661-275-7841 or preferred means via email at john.aguilar2@edwards.af.mil.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is seeking sources for evaluating contractor interest and equipment availability for performing unclassified dredging in Brunswick Inner Harbor, Georgia.  This procurement will be unrestricted.  The NAICS  Code is 237990, with a size standard of $28.5 Million.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Governmen t still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Fed Biz Ops.  No solicitation is currently available.  Estimated cost range is more than $10,000,000.00.  Please respond to the following questions:  1.  Wo uld you bid on a Brunswick Inner Harbor deepening project to deepen the channel depth by 6 feet with the following project features?  a.  Required dredging depth varies from minus 36 feet mllw to minus 39 feet mllw. The portions of the channel to be dredge d are the Brunswick River beginning at Station 22+000 and continuing upstream through Turtle River Lower Range to Station 46+350 and including a new turning basin that ends at Station 1+075 in South Brunswick River (approximately Brunswick Point Cut Range and Turtle River Lower Range and extending 1,075 feet into South Brunswick River), and from Station 0+000 to Stations 2+250 in East River (approximately the first 2,250 feet of the Lower Reach of East River).  b.  Approximately 3 million cubic yards of mat erial are required to be dredged with characteristics of sand as a loose, unconsolidated material as well as materials that are typically calcitic and dolomitic in composition and exhibit some degree of lithification and rock in layers of varying thickness  and hardness. Unconfined compressive strengths of core samples were up to 4,300 psi, while strengths of samples of rock found in the disposal area from a previous dredging project were up to 8,100 psi.  It is estimated that approximately 75% of the materi al to be removed exhibits some degree of lithification, has blow counts greater than 30, or is rock.  c.  The District is currently seeking to obtain clearance for open water disposal in two locations. One site is located adjacent to the Lower East River c hannel (the existing East River turning basin).  The water depth at this site is approximately 30 feet at mean lower low water.  The second site is located approximately 6 miles offshore and has water depths that vary from 30 to 37 feet at mean lower low w ater.  In addition, dredged material can be placed into an upland containment area that has a pumping distance that varies from 1500 feet to 21,000 feet from the project site.    The disposal area has a surface area of approximately 750 acres. The top of t he dike is at approximately 35 feet mllw and the interior elevation varies from approximately 19 feet mllw to 13 feet mllw.  d.  The District is also seeking to obtain clearance for blasting. The Contractor will be required to perform environmental monitor ing if blasting is performed.  2.  Assuming that blasting and open water disposal were allowed, would you bid on this project if work was required to begin between 1 Oct 2004 and 1 Oct 2005?  3.  What size and type of dredging equipment would you use to pe rform the work?  4.  Would you bid on this project if blasting were NOT allowed? 5.  Would you bid on this project if blasting were allowed, but disposal of all of the material was required to be placed in Andrews Island, an upland confined disposal facility?  Responses to this sources sought synopsis may be faxed, or mailed to the att ention of Cheryl Jackson, fax 912-652-6059, US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, Attn: CESAS-CT-P, Cheryl Jackson, PO Box 889, Savannah, GA 31402-0889.  Responses must be received no later than 4:30 Eastern Daylight Time, on 24 October 2003. This  notice is to assist the Savannah District, Corps of Engineers in determining potential sources only. This sources sought synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>Non-Lethal Weapons for Swimmer Engagement
<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City BAA Announcement N61331-04-01 Non-Lethal Weapons for Swimmer Engagement The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) is a leading Naval Sea Systems Command activity in the area of Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection (AT/FP).  Within this mission area, NSWC PC is responsible for the full spectrum of research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) of technologies that can be applied to defend against hostile swimmers and divers.  Although many non-lethal weapons exist for use on the land and in the air, there are few, if any systems designed for underwater applications.  As the distance that the Navy and Coast Guard are able to detect and track swimmers and divers increases, the time to respond to alerts also increases.  This additional reaction time provides the option of applying increasing levels of non-lethal force t o determine the diver’s intent and cause him to brake off the attack before lethal force is employed.  The Department of Defense’s Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate has tasked NSWC PC to identify and recommend existing or proposed technologies that can be used to deter, detect and engage swimmers using less than lethal methods.  Proposed technologies and existing technologies that can be modified for defense against underwater swimmers may be funded for development, testing, and fielding.  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to innovative conventional and non-conventional technologies that can be used or modified for defense against underwater divers and swimmers.  NSWC PC is looking for the entire range of technologies from hailing / warning devices, devices that cause minor discomfort, to devices that cause severe disorientation and render the swimmer i ncapable of taking hostile action.  NSWC PC is also looking for systems that can be deployed from different platforms (e.g. small boat, large ship, pier facility, unmanned underwater and surface vehicle, etc.). NSWC Panama City is interested in receiving proposals for RDT&E in the area of Non-Lethal Weapons for Swimmer Defense.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2.  Although it is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication (10 OCT 2003-10 OCT 2004), an initial evaluation will be made three months after publication.  It is strongly encouraged that companies interested in submitting proposals try to meet the three month initial evaluation cut off.  Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting  programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities.  NSWC PC encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals.  Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the technology (although NSWC PC reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; and (4) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for evolutionary engineering of improvements  are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or "white" papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost.  White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length.  White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential DoD relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC PC’s specific mission area; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC PC’s programs are proposed as well as the degree to which tech nical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC PC with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds.  Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC PC using the above noted evaluation criteria.  An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, A LL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purpo ses: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  " If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, includ ing any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation. Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, or institution of higher education. There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin.  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Although there is no set date for submission, an initial evaluation will be made of proposals / white papers received within three months of publication date.  The World Wide Web page for NSWC PC may be accessed for additional information regarding the mission, programs and objectives of the activity at http:\\www.ncsc.navy.mil.

1. SOLICITATION NUMBER:  182-04-001
2. ISSUANCE DATE: October 10, 2003 
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: October 31, 17:00, CET (Tirana) Time, 2003 
4. POSITION TITLE:   Geographic Information Systems Technology Advisor, USAID/Albania 
5. MARKET VALUE:  $61,251 - $79,629 per annum (GS-13 equivalent). 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Two years intermittently
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:   Tirana, Albania 
8. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS: The incumbent will report to the Supervisory Program Officer or his designee.  S/he will be expected to function with a high degree of autonomy within general USAID policies and management guidelines.   
9. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Background:  USAID manages development and transition programs in Albania, financed through Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Albania is about $28 million annually, of which USAID/Albania manages roughly $21.5 million.  In addition to the Director, the Mission is staffed with three Direct Hires (USDHs), six US Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 16 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  The Mission’s Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs), which link with E&E Bureau goals for: strengthened democracy (SO 2.1); civil society and rule of law (SO 2.2); economic restructuring (SO 1.3); health sector reform (SO 4.1); and, special initiatives (SO 4.2).

USAID/Albania seeks to strengthen its capacity for strategic planning, program coordination, and monitoring and evaluation in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the expected results.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has been recognized as an appropriate tool for such purposes.  In December 2002, a USAID-funded national conference on “Applications of GIS in Albania” was met with much enthusiasm.  The Mission, therefore, has been taking steps to establish GIS capability in the Program Office, in order to support each SO.  In August 2003, USAID/Albania selected a full-time FSN GIS Specialist.

B. Basic Function of the Position: 
The intermittent Geographic Information Systems Technology Advisor (GIS Advisor) will serve as a mentor to the incumbent FSN GIS Specialist.  The intermittent GIS Advisor will provide technical guidance and mentoring support in developing the FSN GIS Specialist’s work plan; assist SO Teams to identify ways to incorporate GIS into the design, implementation, monitoring, and program coordination of SO Team portfolios; and, assist, as appropriate, in USAID/Albania’s website design.  The intermittent GIS Advisor will perform the work during a succession of six TDYs, over the course of two years.  The first TDY will be for approximately three weeks, and will be used to develop a full-year work plan for the newly hired FSN GIS Specialist.  Two subsequent TDYs will be for approximately two weeks each to follow-up, assist, and advise the FSN GIS Specialist and SO teams.  Three similar TDYs are planned for the second year of the contract.  As required, the intermittent GIS Advisor will serve as an active or virtual member of SO Teams in the utilization of GIS technology that includes Mission staff, grantees, contractors, host-government officials, and other partners, to ensure maximum program impact with available resources.

C. Major Duties and Responsibilities:
The intermittent GIS Advisor will serve as an expert advisor and technical authority on Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  

Specifically, the intermittent GIS Advisor will oversee the FSN GIS Specialist’s assessment of the hardware and software needs of the Mission for the establishment of a functioning Geographic Information System on the World Wide Web, and participate in the development of a list of procurement needs. This may include: development of technical specifications, budget, and possible procurement sources to assist the Information Technology staff in procuring GIS-specific hardware and software; installing and configuring hardware and software; creating meta-data reference information for all incoming GIS data; creating a reliable backup schedule; and, coordinating with IT staff for safe storage of backup media.
The intermittent GIS Advisor will assist the FSN GIS Specialist in developing a work plan.  Initial efforts may include providing technical expertise in assisting the FSN GIS Specialist to meet the immediate needs of SO teams, in designing maps for information purposes.  The Program Office and SO teams could use these maps during presentations to indicate and evaluate USAID activity locations, and to communicate and share information with USAID/Washington.  Another initial project may include implementing GIS technologies to create a detailed road network map, with distance indication to better plan in-country trips. 

The intermittent GIS Advisor will oversee training of Mission staff, partners, and GoA counterparts in the use of GIS for project planning purposes, and for monitoring policies, strategies, and programs.  The intermittent GIS Advisor will identify useful indicators for visualization by GIS, in cooperation with SO teams, partners, and M&E Specialists.   

Advice will be provided to Mission SO Teams on new developments in GIS technologies, and on any new approaches to problems of development assistance in Albania.  The GIS Advisor will provide technical liaison with other USG Agencies, other donor organizations, multilateral banks, PVOs/NGOs, and other organizations to coordinate their efforts with specific USAID SO programs, activity portfolios, and approaches in Albania.

The intermittent GIS Advisor will work with the FSN GIS Specialist to coordinate the development and maintenance of a logically accessible electronic image library of all created maps, photos, and data; ensure that the FSN GIS Specialist can elaborate and explain the data format requirements and data exchange protocols of the GIS-lab to GIS users; and, assist the FSN GIS Specialist in creating web page templates and style sheets to facilitate multiple web page development for the Program Office and SO Teams.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation DTCG85-04-Q-625029 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-14.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

They consist of three layers of full grain cowhide.  The top layer is cut from 9 to 10 ounce cowhide and will have the silhouette of the badge cut from the center of the oval.  The second layer, 6 to 7 ounce leather, will have slots for the pin portion of the badge to hold it in place.  The third or back piece of leather is also 6 to 7 ounce leather, which will become the smooth back.  The third layer may be opened to accommodate the pinning of the badge to the second layer and secured by means of Velcro as an option.  Between the second and third layer, and located at the top of the oval, will be a loop ¾” wide, cut from a 4 to 5 ounce piece of cowhide.  The loop shall be glued and sewn in place for maximum durability.  A 30” stainless steel #6 size bead chain will be added to the loop so that the badge holder can be easily slipped over the head of the user.  Stainless steel shall be used because of it’s inherent ability to be rust resistant in all types of climates, there is no plating to wear off, and it is hypoallergenic so that in most instances it will not create any discoloration to the user’s skin.  The three pieces of cowhide leather will be glued around the edges and sewn together using a polyester thread, a #300 top thread and a #270 bottom thread.  The badge holder shall be dipped into a black professional oil dye to insure even and deep coverage.  Then an acrylic topcoat will be added for further protection of the leather.

b.  Packaging:  All leather neck badge holders will be packaged in individual zip lock plastic bags.  Each bag will consist of the leather neck badge holder and a card that outlines warranty and leather care information.  Leather neck badge holders shall be boxed in groups of 100 units.

7. Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: VOYAGE CHARTER FORCE PROTECTION.

    (1) Owner agrees that u.s. armed forces personnel may board the vessel at any time at any location for U.S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. armed forces personnel in the boarding party.

    (2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to such United States Armed Forces boarding party with respect to the identification of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel, and to permit the United States Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

    (3) Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer, or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly so as not to delay prosecution of the voyage, and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear reasonable costs incurred by the Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

    (4) Owner understands and agrees that members of and equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the United States of America may be embarked aboard the Vessel during the period of the charter.  Charterer reserves the right, at charterer’s sole option, to embark armed U.S. Armed Forces members. The U.S. Armed Forces personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by U.S. Military Authorities, and will operate under the command of competent U.S. Military Authorities. Charterer agrees to reimburse the Owner of cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the charter for Supercargoes.  Owner agrees to provide at Owner’s expense, life saving equipment for up to 12 personnel in accordance with SOLAS and all applicable regulatory requirements.

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide a certified crew list no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the load port (or first designated load port in that case of multiple load ports).  A list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is also required within 6 hours of personnel change. The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (either Microsoft Word or Excel).

ADD: DEMURRAGE DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage, all supporting documents as identified in TANKVOY III(d) (3) Invoices, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage invoices. After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage invoices (with the DD Form 250-1) to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.
ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

MODIFY: IV(i) – add new subparagraph: “(5) Owner must immediately notify Charterer of any changes in the Vessel’s commercial war risk insurance, including but not limited to, extensions of war risk exclusion zones and increases in commercial war risk insurance premiums.  Owners must secure Charterer’s permission prior to entry into any commercial war risk exclusion zones before incurring liability for additional premiums.”

MODIFY: III(p) – add new sentence at the end of subparagraph (1): “The United States of America shall be named as an additional Assured Party with waiver of subrogation on all applicable insurance policies.”

Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.
