5th SIGNAL COMMAND G-3

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

DATE: 24 March 2004

1.0 General. Acquire a contract for Quality Assurance (QA) inspection of the four 11-meter (C-band) satellite communication systems and provide 24-hour per day, 7-days per week (24 x 7) help line to ensure that the systems continue to operate at their optimum performance.

1.1 Introduction.  The United States Army, 5th Signal Command for US Army Europe (USAEUR) has C-band satellite communications systems strategically located that comprise the US Army Kosovo Forces (KFOR) communications network.  Because of the age of these systems, the government and contract technicians do not have the expertise to determine if these systems require a more extensive maintenance.

1.2 Background.  This requirement evolved from the communications package that was specifically designed to operate in KFOR as the primary command and control link between three geographically dispersed camps in KFOR and the point of entry in Germany for a short period of time to a now semi-permanent duration.  The equipment has now aged significantly and reliability is now questionable at best, therefore the equipment warrants an inspection by the system experts. 

1.3 Place of Performance.  Work under this PWS shall be accomplished at the following four sites; Coleman Barracks Mannheim Germany, Camp Monteith (CMT) Kosovo, Camp Bondsteel (CBS) Kosovo, and Camp Able Sentry (CAS) Skopje Macedonia. 

1.4 Hours of Operation. The Contractor shall perform work during normal workday hours (0730 to 1700 local time) Monday through Friday excluding holidays.

1.5 Period of Performance.  The Initial inspection shall be between 15 April 2004 and 30 May 2004 by a mutually agreed upon schedule by the Contractor and the Government.  Follow-on inspections per site may be on or about 6-months intervals after the initial inspections by a mutually agreed upon schedule with the Government. Two additional inspections per year per site will be reserved for unexpected troubleshooting as required. Only one inspection per year, per operational site will be guaranteed. 

1.6 Privacy Act.  Work on this project may require that personnel have access to Privacy Information.  Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552A and applicable agency rules and regulations.

1.7 Security.   This project is classified Secret.  A DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and an USASC FORM 755-R-E, Visit Request and Clearance / Access Certification form, for each employee performing the tasks shall be initiated and submitted to the Government Security Officer to accommodate this requirement.  

1.8 Personnel.  The Contractor shall identify personnel in the technical proposal regardless of the type of task. Personnel shall not be removed from the task without express approval of the Government.  Substitution of key personnel must be of equivalent skills as the initial proposed personnel and pre-approved by the Government.

1.9 Quality Control.  The Contractor shall provide a description of their Quality Control (QC) Plan in the technical proposal. The QC Plan’s main purpose is to ensure all tasks are completed and minimize the reduction in performance quality of the C-band systems. 

1.10  Applicable Documents. 
 
-	DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification,
-	USASC FORM 755-R-E, Visit Request And Clearance / Access Certification

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a modification under sole-source firm-fixed price contract N00019-03-C-6554 with Honeywell International Inc. - Defense Avionics Systems, Defense & Space Systems, 9201 San Mateo Blvd., Albuquerque, NM for the acquisition and development of testing stations to support the Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract with Honeywell for displays.  The testers will enable repairs of AMC&D displays including the Advanced Multi-Purpose Color Display (AMPCD) for the AV-8B and F/A-18C/D/E/F/G aircraft. The testers will be located at the contractor repair depot (Phoenix Support Center) operated by Honeywell. Deliveries shall be required within 14 months of modification award.   Estimated quantities are 2 each testers.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Honeywell has developed and produced all displays for the AMC&D system and is uniquely qualified to assess test station requirements for repairs of these same units. Honeywell is currently the prime contractor on two full-rate production contracts with the Naval Air Systems Command for AMPCDs. This acquisition directly facilitates integrated logistics support for these units. Stringent performance requirements are imposed on the display because of the extreme environment in which carrier-based tactical aircraft operate.  These performance requirements include (but are not limited to) exceptional daytime and nighttime luminance tolerances, night vision devices compatibility, and extreme thermal, shock and vibration environment compatibility. As manufacturer of the AMPCD, only Honeywell understands these performance requirements and the repairs necessary to modify broken units to meet performance specification. While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their technical capability to respond to this requirement and may submit information that shall be considered by the Naval Air Systems Command. Any inquiries may be directed to Clare Carmack, Contracting Officer, phone 301-757-5919, or sent via email to: clare.carmack@navy.mil. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, New Iberia Research Center (NIRC), 4401 W. Admiral Doyle Drive, New Iberia, Louisiana, under existing contract N01-NS-9-2302, for an additional 105,000 hours of labor effort to the current contract term, October 30, 1998 through October 31, 2003.  The contract is entitled Study of Slow, Latent and Temperate Virus Infections of the Nervous System caused by Conventional and Unconventional Viruses; and, Maintenance of a Breeding Colony of Rhesus Monkeys for Intramural Research. The current contract requires support for the work needed for the veterinary care, technical support care, treatment and housing of a research animal colony of approximately 73 nonhuman primates involved in the study of slow, latent and temperate infections of the nervous system caused by conventional and unconventional viruses.  Included in the nonhuman primates are 65 chimpanzees, 1 gibbon, and 7 New World monkeys.   In addition, the contract requires support for the work needed for the animal housing, veterinary care, management and maintenance of the NINDS specific pathogen free rhesus macaque breeding colony. The present population of the rhesus monkey breeding colony is approximately 128 monkeys.  This new work will require NIRC to continue performing all of the aforementioned tasks.  NIRC provides on-site veterinary care, extensive knowledge of and experience with infectious diseases, and is well versed in the prescribed guidelines on the use and care of laboratory animals.  In addition, NIRC provides AAALAC accredited state-of-the-art facilities, which includes indoor and outdoor caging for the animals noted above.  The research animal colonies at NIRC are housed separately by species, and supporting clinical examining and treatment rooms, and surgical rooms are adjacent to the housing areas, all of which are AAALAC accredited. A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  NIRC has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff’s familiarity with the various NINDS on-going studies supported by the NIRC.  To move the animals to a new location would be very disruptive to them, since a number of them have been at NIRC for over twenty years.  In addition, relocation may jeopardize the research activities, and it would be very expensive to the NINDS to move the animals to a new facility.  NIRC has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their experience to date under the contract.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for the additional labor effort unfeasible.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to develop new technology leading to a matrix resin with high fire resistance and other properties required for use in primary and secondary composite structures on future subsonic commercial and general aviation airplanes.  The Contractor shall conduct appropriate research to develop new technology leading to a cured resin with high fire resistance that provide composites with properties similar to those in Boeing Material Specification 8-276.  The fire resistance may be attained by the incorporation of phosphorus and/or some other element that provides fire resistance to the resin.  Additives and halogenated compounds shall not be used to obtain fire resistance.  NASA Langley Research Center shall provide 250 grams each of up to 4 different fire retardant compounds such as phorphorus containing diamines and epoxies for evaluation.  Other approaches and/or compounds leading to a fire resistant resin may be considered by the Government.  Each promising epoxy formulation and cured epoxy molding shall be characterized for fire resistance, mechanical and physical properties.	The two most promising formulations shall be used to prepare unidirectional tape using an intermediate modulus carbon fiber.  Flat laminates shall be fabricated and tested.	The best performing formulation shall be scaled-up to prepare adequate intermediate modulus carbon fiber unidirectional tape and fabric prepreg for more comprehensive laminate evaluation.	 NASA/LaRC intends to award a cost-sharing contract for this effort. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,500, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about April 9, 2004 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about May 10, 2004. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>As a result of an unsolicited proposal, NASA/HQ plans to negotiate and award a contract to improve the modeling of detailed sea ice mechanics of fracture and lead formation through the use of newly available data sets produced from the RADARSAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.	NASA/HQ intends to negotiate with NorthWest Research Associates (NWRA) on a sole source basis.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented at FAR Part 6.302-1.  Pursuant to 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), NWRA has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique capability to provide the research services, offers a concept and service not otherwise available to the Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition.  NWRA proposes to implement, test and validate a new sea ice dynamics model that will treat the ice cover as an anisotripic elastic/plastic strain-hardening material in the permanent pack.  These data will focus on the thin frazil/pancake ice, which is poorly represented in current models, but can likely be greatly improved through careful analysis of high-resolution RADARSAT data, as the investigators plan to do.  NWRA's unique capability to perform the required research services is based upon the ability to provide over 30 years of experience in sea ice research, with particular expertise in the mechanics of sea ice and experience in the analysis of ice motion/deformation products generated by the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System.  Only a limited number of scientists have the specific expertise in this area to insure the success of the endeavor.  NWRA and its collaborators are uniquely qualified to merge the strengths of the remote sensing capabilities with the most advanced mechanics modeling capabilities to yield the desired results.  NWRA is currently the only source known to possess all of the knowledge, experience and other capabilities necessary to complete the effort without a substantial duplication of costs to the Government and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling NASA's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 7, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program. The proven technology is a non-invasive ultrasonic sensor that can be easily installed, operated, and maintained on the outside of a conduit to measure in real time the density or solids concentration of a slurry within the conduit.  By using multiple reflections of the ultrasound within the conduit wall, the acoustic impedance (defined as the product of the density of the liquid and the velocity of sound in the liquid) is determined. Thus, the wall is part of the measurement system.  The density is obtained by coupling the acoustic impedance measurement with a velocity of sound measurement. The instrument contains a critical self-calibrating feature whereby the measurement of the acoustic impedance is independent of changes in the pulser voltage. The ultrasonic sensor can be attached permanently to a pipeline wall, possibly as a spool piece inserted into the process line, or clamped onto an existing pipeline wall and be movable to another location. The versatile sensor platform further allows the evaluation of other physical properties of the slurry such as viscosity, particle size changes, and interfaces between constituents.  The technology is patent pending (US20030172734A1).  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for the High Power Microwave Technical Area and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETARDEHPM program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 32 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between an HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

This is a request for information from interested parties.  We are interested in whether or not you have the capability to fulfill the potential requirement that follows and a rough order of magnitude relating to price.

The Coalition Provisional Authority, Iraq is considering entering into contract for the security of convoy’s between CSC Navistar, Kuwait (long. 47.71E, lat. 30.09N); CSC Cedar, Iraq (long. 46.42E, lat. 30.61N); Scania, Iraq (long. 44.73E, lat. 32.31N) and the following depots: Latifiya, Iraq (long. 44.37E, lat. 32.55N); Mushada, Iraq (long. 44.12E, lat. 33.65N); Rasafa, Iraq (long. 44.52E, lat. 33.48N); Diwaniya, Iraq (long. 44.89E, lat. 31.98N); Hilla, Iraq (long. 44.44E, lat. 32.51N); An Najaf, Iraq (long. 44.32E, lat. 32.01N); Kut, Iraq (long. 45.81E, lat. 32.50N) and Nasiriyah, Iraq (long. 46.19E, lat. 31.04N).


The contractor will provide all labor, rations, equipment and weapons to safely escort humanitarian fuel convoys from the Kuwaiti border to various fuel depots from Nasiriyah to just north of Baghdad.  There will be approximately 8 convoy packages per day departing from NAVSTAR at the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border to the following depots: Latifiya, Mushada, Rasafa, Diwaniya, Hilla, An Najaf,  Kut and Nasiriyah.  Typical convoy round trip time is currently 8 days, with overnight stays possible at Cedar and Scania as well as various fuel depots.  Coalition Forces provide security at Cedar and Scania.  Ministry of Oil provides security within the perimeter of the depots.  The contractor is responsible for all security between these points.

The contractor shall provide security for each convoy, usually 20 to 30 trucks per convoy, with at least two vehicles; one in front and one in the back.  Contractor vehicles will be marked to allow clear identification by Coalition Forces.  Each vehicle will be manned by three personnel.  Each vehicle shall have a Government approved automatic, mid to long range weapon mounted such that it can provide 360-degree coverage around the vehicle.  Additionally, each security person in the vehicle shall have a personal automatic rifle that is approved by the Government.  

Each vehicle shall have the ability to communicate via radio and Thuraya or equivalent communication with each other and each of the staging points (Scania, Navistar, and Cedar).  

The contractor is responsible for having a representative at these sites that will act as a liaison with the military and maintains communication with the convoy escorts at all times.  Coalition Forces are responsible for providing a quick reaction force if the contractor notifies the military that the convoy has come under attack.

The contractor is required to display or wear any uniforms designated by the government and display colors, tape, radar reflectors, or markings on their vehicles as dictated by the government.  The contractor shall coordinate all movements with the military liaison designated by the government.

The contractor is responsible for all maintenance, fuel, ammunition, etc for their vehicles.  Convoys will operate exclusively during daylight hours.  The military reserves the right to determine when a convoy can leave and enter compounds.  The contractor is not required to escort during periods of darkness or severely reduced visibility.  

The Government will be held harmless, and is not liable for any damage caused by acts of war, aggression or natural disasters effecting contractor vehicles or personnel.

The contractor is responsible for their own supply and re-supply of ammunition.  Quantities and types of ammunition on hand must be approved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to disallow convoy movements if the preparation of the contractor is deemed inadequate.

The contractor is responsible for providing first responder medical care to its own personnel.  The contractor shall be given military medical care in the event of an emergency and is authorized to utilize the emergency medical frequency.

The contractor shall be paid based on the number of convoys escorted to final destination.  These prices shall be fixed price and not subject to redetermination.

This is not a request for quote.  Information provided is completely voluntary.  This RFI does not in any way constitute intent by the Government to form a contract.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology is a low-cost and non-invasive liquid level sensor that can be easily installed, operated, and maintained.  The liquid level sensor comprises a single transducer mounted to the outside surface of a storage container. The single transducer employs either multiple piezoelectric elements or mechanical impactors to generate acoustic burst signals with transverse or oblique propagation paths. The transverse propagation path is directed across the tank at the height of the transducer location. The time-of-flight of this echo depends mainly upon the transverse distance (e.g., vessel diameter), the liquid temperature, and the acoustic properties of the liquid. The oblique paths are directed at angles toward the top of the tank so that they reflect off the liquid surface in order to return to the transducer. Accordingly, the time-of-flights of these oblique echoes depend upon the height of the liquid surface above the transducer.  The liquid level, and its precision, is estimated from these time-of-flights using a physical model and rigorous mathematical algorithms. The level of the liquid is estimated by comparing the ultrasonic traces from one or more oblique paths to the ultrasonic trace from the transverse path, and in particular, by comparing the distinct burst travel times from the oblique and transverse paths. Preliminary laboratory studies show a fill level accuracy of 2 to 5%.  The technology is patent pending.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The IPV contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances & supply chain management capability to support planned & un-planned requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA & its customers.  These sophisticated logistics solutions require a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier & DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state-of-the-art information technology & assured communications is essential for optimum support & total asset visibility.  This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair & overhaul of Army ground weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial & government DLA sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contract may also include provisions in support of Worldwide Demand (WWD) requirements for selected items; Just-in-Time support & at least 98% fill rates for all schedule of items requirements.  This solicitation's customer base are two Army bases located in Anniston, AL (ANAD) & Red River, TX (RRAD).  The approximate scope includes 10,057 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated annual price, absent WWD, of approximately $12,042,253.00.  The Market Basket shall consist of commercially sourced items & DLA sourced items, which are expected to represent the profile of commercially, & DLA sourced items for the contract term, which is a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items may be designated WWD & some for the site-only use.  Unanticipated non-repetitive requirements will be supported by Spot-buys which are procurements based on urgency.  For each NSN on the Market Basket and subsequent contract offerors are required to provide a unit price & a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: All estimated prices are fully burdened to include Material cost, Profit & F.O.B. Destination).  It is the Government's intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Priced with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with two 2-year term options & one 3-year term option.  The solicitation will utilize 'Best Value Source Selection' procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit; Experience & Past Performance; Socio-Economic Consideration; Javits-Wagner-O'Day considerations & DLA Mentoring Businesses Agreement Program.  Just-in-Time deliveries to Army sites will be required.  Offertory will be required to submit a delivery schedule for the WWD quantities for each of the items listed on the Market Basket.  Note: Deliveries may vary among product lines; offerors are required to provide a delivery schedule for each.  The deadline for receipt of proposals will be sixty (60) days from the solicitation issue date.  DSCP plans on conducting site visits approximately two weeks after the solicitation issue date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Additionally, all analysts can work side-by-side with government analysts and other support contractor analysts; can clearly communicate complex technical and engineering conc epts with personnel who have technical expertise. The scope of this effort will be provide AFCAA/FMS with technical and cost estimating support including specialized cost analysis, estimating support, data collection, methods development, and model development to augment and enhance the ability of AFCAA/F MS to meet its mission of providing a wide range of cost analysis in support of the acquisition of DoD space systems.   The effort requires the appropriate skills and experience mix to perform in all of the following areas: i.	Development of realistic space system life cycle cost estimates in support of AFCAA/FMS independent cost estimates (ICEs), independent cost assessments (ICAs), budgetary support activities, trade studies, source selections, and other special studies as required by the AFCAA/FMS, and associated documentation to support all work. ii.	Development and documentation of the cost and technical infrastructure and estimating processes that enables the AFCAA/FMS to provide enhanced cost estimating support to Air Force and other DoD space programs and organizations. iii.	Collection, organization, normalization, analysis, and documentation of cost, technical, and programmatic data related to a wide spectrum of space systems. This requires routine time-critical support, as well as regularly scheduled meetings. iv.	Identifying areas for collection of data and/or development of methods that are needed to improve AFCAA/FMS cost estimating methodologies and cost risk assessment techniques. Assist in the methods development, data collection effort, and documentation associated with each. v.	Management, performance, and reporting of the following activities: cost estimating, data collection, cost estimating methods development including risk analysis, and support to database administration and operations (entering data into the database and  using data from the database.) vi.	Utilize the Earned Value Management process. vii.	Maintain knowledge of state of the art space system technologies and their relationship to program costs. For cost and technical support, the AFCAA/FMS envisions the assigned cost analysts to be able to reach back to the company and utilize their staff of analysts and engineers who are experts and specifically familiar with state-of-the-art spacecraft bus, spa cecraft payloads, ground segment, and production issues.  The contractor must maintain knowledge of state-of-the art technologies and their relationship to program costs, schedule and performance, and be able to relate this knowledge to estimates for curre nt space systems.   We envision utilizing their reach back capability based on 5% - 10 % of hours expended by their on-site, full time staff. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available around 01 April 2004.  The solicitation number will be W74V8H-04-R-0034.  The period of performance will be for a twelve month base period with three, twelve month option periods.  When  available, solicitation will be available at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.asp

<DESC>NAICS Code: 484121   The purpose of Amendment 1 to RFQ-OH-04-00073 is to provide offerors answers to relevant  questions that have been asked regarding this procurement. The due date for quotations has been extended to 12:00 PM NOON EST, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 2004. The questions and answers are as follows:   Q1. Will the iron be shipped in flatbeds or vans?  Answer 1: Either or both.  Q2. If the iron is shipped on a flatbed, do you require tarps to cover the iron?  Answer 2: The iron must be protected from inclement weather, as reflected in the SOW.  Q3. Can large businesses big  on this requirement?  Answer 3: No. This is a small business set-aside, as stated in the synopsis.   Q4. What forms are needed to bid on this requirement?  Answer 4: There are no formal documents required to submit a quote. However, quotes must include a copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. This clause may be found on the Internet at the following site: http://www.arnet.gov/far Q5. Does the iron metal aggregate contain hazardous material?  Answer 5: No.  Q6. Is the 72-hour window for delivery flexible? What if we run  into bad weather on the way?  Answer 6: There may be some flexibility here. For example, if you were to pick-up on a Thursday morning, 72 hours later would be Sunday, and there would be no one available to receive the iron until Monday morning. Also, delays due to inclement weather would be  reasonable. However, if you cannot accept the government's delivery requirements you must stipulate this in your quote.    Q7. What is the exact pick-up/drop-off address for the iron?  Answer 7: This will be made available at the time of purchase order award.  Q8. How many truckloads do you  require?  Answer 8: As specified in the Fedbizopps announcement, based on input from the Iron Metal Aggregate Supplier, the government believes it needs 17 trucks to transport 380 tons of iron metal aggregate. If, however, it is to the government's benefit to have more or less truckloads, quoters  should make this known in their quotes.  Q9. Can I bid only on the transportation? Or am I required to bid on both the iron and the transportation?  Answer 9: This requirement is for transportation ONLY. The iron has already been purchased under a different EPA contract.  Q10.    Does the EPA.  have a problem with my business sub-contracting the trucking?   Answer 10: No, however the quoter/awardee is responsible for completing the work.    Q11. What will EPA do if fuel prices fluctuate?  Answer 11: Nothing. This will be a fixed-price purchase order. Since we are so close to the ship  date of April 19, you should have a realistic idea of what fuel prices will be.

<DESC>I received approximately 45 responses to this notice. Thank you. From that set we should be able to arrive at a subset to survey and/or conduct a focus group. No additional volunteers are necessary. Regarding timing, we are first intending to conduct surveys of government agencies to determine if there is demand for a SDVB GWAC, or if existing vehicles (i.e. the GSA Federal Supply Schedule 70) already address the matter from a procurement vehicle perspective. I'm keeping the contact information from those who volunteered, and we will be in touch - probably in late April.

Thanks - Matt.

The projected number of surveys required each year is 0 to 20 in any location. The total expenditure each year of the BPA will not exceed $200,000.00. There is no guaranteed minimum number of surveys to be ordered in any year of the BPA. 

The work consists of performing land surveys, preparing and furnishing plat maps, electronic (digital) survey files, written descriptions of land surveys, marking of easement boundary and any other items as required by the specifications.

Firms will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Licensed Land Surveyor in Kentucky, 2) Experience and recent performance, 3) Equipment submitted for use, 4) Training and Experience of support personnel, 5) Location of permanent employees and their knowledge of the project area.   All will be equally weighted in the rating criteria.

<DESC>DISTRIBUTED NETWORKED FORCES (DNF), RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND COMPLEX ANALTICAL TOOLS & METHODS
•	Explore and develop analysis, which uses universal scaling laws, adaptive computational tools such as non-linear dynamics, and genomic algorithms, and apply these tenets holistically across the force, to empirically understand the power law relationships represented in a distributed networked force and possibly needed for future defense related force architectures. 
•	Insight into networked behavior, structural topology, and the dependency of interconnectivity on organizational relationships for effective command and control of a geographically dispersed networked force (not the LANS, servers, nodes or electronic connections). 
•	Roles, metrics, and impact needed to incorporate autonomous assets such as UUVs, USVs, and UAVs as part of the Distributed Networked Force.
•	The use of very fast hull forms (>60 knots), scale free attributes, high numbers and the modular aspects that affect the operational capability of Distributed Networked Forces.
•	Understand the micro and macro organizational relationships between National Security Council, DoD, OSD, the Services and Combatant Commands from top to bottom when using distributed networked forces.
•	Create co-evolutionary options, using agent based models and methods, for the kinds of forces needed to operate in a complex adaptive environment. 
•	The structure and analysis, which may reduce C2 overhead when commanding, controlling and manipulating the complex behavior of high numbers of geographically dispersed interconnected forces (Distributed Networked Forces).
•	Provide and determine modular principles, and the trade offs between integration and modularity at the lowest scale (construction) to recombination of assets at the highest operational level.  Determine how these affect Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL), as well as the advantages of incorporating a dynamic and adaptive Command and Control structure for the employment of Distributed Networked Forces.
•	Create or adapt software tools, algorithms, and methods for determining the function, scale, application and management of modular transport systems.  Determine the aspects of dimensionally related cargo and the metrics needed to determine the principles of modularity when applied to Distributed Networked Forces using a Sense and Respond neural network.
•	Provide and determine the necessary Real Option analysis qualities and metrics that are needed for strategic, operational, and tactical decisions imbedded in a Distributed Networked Force which; Preserve Flexibility – For adapting to uncertainty; Hedge against Contingencies –For reacting to the unexpected; and Mitigate Volatility – By continuously creating new options.  Determine how these items are quantified for Real Options analysis, and how these values provide options in a complex uncertain environment endemic to conflict.  Quantify and present, in mathematical form, the Real Option variables for defense analysis.  Determine what are the right Real Option valuations, produce the computational framework, generate analytical software tools as applied to defense and compare them to financial options for validity. 
•	Using Real Options analysis, evaluate the future value of today capabilities and the present value of tomorrow’s capability.  Assess the values that are needed to create reliable (skewed or broadened) distribution data sets that can be tested by experimentation or by evolutionary agent based models.  Create the histograms necessary for assessing the value of flexibility in current and future capabilities.  
•	Adapting command and control relationships to distributed networked modular forces will be needed to manage the uncertainty produced by the high transaction rates of operating these geographically dispersed forces in complex adaptive environments.  Determine the metrics and analysis needed to lower C2 overhead and as a consequence reduce latency to improve three key information age metrics:  Faster Speed of Command, Higher Quality of Effects, and Increase in Shared Awareness.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center is conducting market research only to identify companies who may have experience and capabilities in the development and production of a miniature coherent radar and a point-to-point high rate data link at mmW.  The radar/data link is expected to be enclosed in a small volume approximately 250 cu. in. and operate in a marine environment.  The antenna must have high gain and be capable of beam steering to compensate for minor platform motion and, for the data link, remain aligned with a slow-moving data link partner.  The average transmit power will be approximately 5 watts or less.  The Government is interested in using software radio techniques in the design of this radar and data link.  The Government has done preliminary design work in this area and is interested in a company that would work closely with the Government to complete the development for production.  Production quantities are anticipated to be approximately 100 units.  The company should be able to manufacture, maintain, and upgrade systems over time.  Companies must be able to obtain and maintain a facility security clearance and handle classified information and equipment.  Potential rough order of magnitude cost/schedule information is also desirable, if available.  Submissions should include past and present projects and experience in the following areas:  radar, data link, signal processing, antenna design, land, air, and sea testing, and manufacturing capabilities.  Submissions should also include company name, facility clearance level (if applicable) or ability to obtain and maintain a facility clearance, point-of-contact information, and company size.  The Government is not interested in general company capability information and will not accept such submissions.  All replies should be five (5) pages or less and interested sources should submit replies by email only no later than 4:00 p.m. PST on 16 April 2004 to Jennifer.Kerns@navy.mil.  The point of contact for this RFI is Jennifer Kerns, (760) 939-4526.   Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this RFI.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Navy in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included in one or more RFPs, which will be released to industry.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify interested potential sources capable of providing proven, yet contemporary, approaches to accomplishing B-52 radome testing requirements.  It is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.

The Government has the requirement to functionally test the B-52 radomes listed below:

NSN: 1560012568390FG, P/N: 35-30179-604, Nose Radome
NSN: 1560012733145FG, P/N: 35-30355-514, R/H Side Radome
NSN: 1560012733146FG, P/N: 35-30355-509, L/H Side Radome

The current government test facility, located at Building 3507, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, is antiquated and requires extensive refurbishment or replacement.  The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center anticipates conducting a B-52 Radome Testing Industry Day to investigate future options for accomplishing this critical testing requirement.  The Air Force is seeking aerospace industry inputs from responsible sources, with demonstrated radome test capabilities, to evaluate the current facility, the B-52 radome test requirements and offer approaches for accomplishing the testing of B-52 radomes to include the refurbishment or replacement of equipment in the existing on-base facility, or the use of off-base commercial facilities.  

Industry Day is scheduled for 9 March 2004 in Building 3001, LH Conference Room, Post 2AH192B, to review the B-52 radome testing requirements and to tour the current Far Field Radar Test Range (FFRTR) facility.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event. Seating is limited, therefore advance written requests for admittance are required not later than COB 5 March 2004 and each contractor is limited to four (4) representatives.  All attendees must be cleared at DoD SECRET level, in order to participate.  All written responses and visitor clearances should be addressed to Della Wyatt, OC-ALC/PSKCB, (405)739-5797, email at della.wyatt@tinker.af.mil or faxed to (405)739-4452.  Technical information regarding B-52 test requirements will be forwarded upon request.

Upon completion of the Industry Day, interested parties will be given an opportunity to submit questions until COB 15 March 2004.   Answers will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.   Interested parties should provide a brief written response and description of potential approach(s) for accomplishing testing of B-52 Radomes for review by the Government by COB 31 March 2004.  Responses should also include the offerors’ radome testing qualifications, with respect to the key features discussed above, as well as examples of projects where goals similar to those listed above were achieved.

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code has not yet been determined and the small business set-aside, if any, has not been determined.

<SUBJECT>46 -- Silos 1 & 2 Mobile On-Site Water Treatment Support
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-B13019
<RESPDATE>042304
<ARCHDATE>05082004
<CONTACT>William Hensley, Procurement Manager, Phone 513-648-4478, Fax 513-648-5235, Email william_hensley@fernald.gov - William Hensley, Procurement Manager, Phone 513-648-4478, Fax 513-648-5235, Email william_hensley@fernald.gov
<DESC>Fluor Fernald, Inc. (Fluor Fernald), the prime contractor at the United States Department of Energy’s (U.S. DOE) Fernald Closure Project (FCP), is seeking on-site support for the treatment of wastewater resulting from Silos 1 and 2 waste treatment operations.  Silos 1 and 2 were constructed in 1951 and were used for storage of radium-bearing residues that are the solid by-products of the processing of uranium ore. In the process to be implemented for treatment of the K-65 residues, the contents of Silos 1 and 2 will be removed by sluicing and then decanted for temporary storage in a Transfer Tank Area (TTA).  The Silos 1 and 2 K-65 residues will be retrieved from the TTA tanks by sluicing and transferred to the treatment facility.  K-65 residues treatment will consist of addition of chemicals and pozzolanic materials to form a solid grout that meets various physical criteria, waste disposal criteria, and leaching criteria for RCRA metals.  

Fluor Fernald anticipates that between 0.5 and 2.6 million gallons of water requiring treatment could arise as a result of being residual or excess water from the above operations, from safe-shutdown operations, and from decontamination and dismantlement (D & D) operations.  The primary contaminants to be removed from that wastewater are radium-226 and soluble lead compounds.  Soluble lead is expected to range from 200 to over 6,000 ug/L, while dissolved radium is expected to have activities ranging from 1.0 to 30 nCi/L.  The wastewater will range from low total dissolved solids (on the order of 300 to 500 mg/L) to high dissolved solids (on the order of 10 to 40 g/L).  The dissolved solids in the latter case will be comprised mostly of sodium, potassium, and magnesium nitrates, and sulfates.  Lastly, suspended solids are expected to be present but most likely will be in low concentrations.  These solids however will have high concentrations of lead oxides (on the order of 10%) and high activity concentrations of radium-226, lead-210, and thorium-230.

Fluor Fernald anticipates that a dedicated, temporary, mobile water treatment system will be needed to treat the wastewater expected from the Silos operations.  This system should include all necessary modules for the primary removal of radium-226 and lead from the wastewater, all necessary water polishing modules, modules necessary for the treatment of any sludge generated, and radon emanation control modules if deemed necessary.  The lead concentration in the effluent from the proposed treatment system should not exceed 73 ug/L, the radium-226 activity should not exceed 100 pCi/L, and suspended solids should not exceed 1.0 mg/L.  

Fluor Fernald anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to mobilize a temporary water treatment system sufficient to handle the above tasks to the FCP, located about 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The water treatment system shall employ proven technology comprising fully equipped, stand-alone modules. The RFP will require that the Contractor provide experienced personnel to perform any necessary treatability or jar tests.  The RFP may contain an option for the Contractor to provide qualified on-site personnel to operate the treatment system.  
With this announcement Fluor Fernald is seeking expressions of interest from Potential Offerors who 1) have experience with mobilizing/demobilizing temporary modular water treatment systems to various sites, 2) have experience with treating radioactive waste water, 3) have experience with providing systems to treat wastewater for soluble lead and radium-226, and 4) have experience working at U.S. DOE sites.  Interested vendors are invited to submit the following information: 1) an overview of the company, 2) a brief technical description of the water treatment system employing proven technology that would be mobilized to the FCP, 3) a brief summary of system specifications, 4) a one-page block flow diagram, 5) a one-page general layout diagram, 6) a rough order of magnitude cost estimate of the system and services that are anticipated to be provided, 7) a description of the company’s experience and expertise with treating waste water for lead and radium-226, 8) a brief listing of projects involving treatment of waste water with such a system, 9) a listing of the company’s experience in performing work at U.S. DOE sites, and 10) the availability of the treatment system to the FCP from February 2005 through December 2005.

Potential Offerors who respond to the RFP for water treatment support will be required to address all the key tasks from mobilization of the water treatment system through demobilization of the system.  Additionally, the RFP will require the Contractor to operate in conformance to all FCP health and safety, radiological control, quality assurance, and other site procedures and programs. 

This announcement does not constitute a RFP nor does it guarantee that a RFP will be forthcoming.

PURPOSE:  The Navy seeks to identify responsible, capable sources in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 and the Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum of October 09, 2002, “Revised Guidance for the Utilities Privatization Program.”  Commander, Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC EFD PACIFIC PEARL HARBOR) is seeking interest and information specifically for the potential privatization of the electrical distribution system and the wastewater system for the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH), which provides service to its customers at MCBH, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  Interested parties shall provide an expression of interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 30 pages in length).  Separate expressions of interest are required for each system, the electrical system and the wastewater system, if submitting information for both systems.  A single submission for both systems will NOT be accepted.  Potential sources may submit expressions of interest for one system and not the other.  This sources sought is not a formal Request for Proposal.  If sufficient credible interest is received, a formal Request for Proposal may be issued.  The Government shall not be held responsible for the cost of a party's expression of interest.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the utility systems, which provide quality electrical distribution and quality wastewater services to customers in the MCBH, Kaneohe Bay area.  

Electrical Distribution System

MCBH Kaneohe Bay purchases electrical power from Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO), which provides power for MCBH Kaneohe Bay through one main service point at 11.5 KV.  All 46/12 kV transformer capacity is provided by HECO, while MCBH Kaneohe Bay owns and operates the electrical distribution system (EDS) on base including the 12kV feeders from the HECO transformers to the Main Switch Station.  The system is comprised of 52 miles of overhead and underground lines and has an aggregated system peak of 18MW.  Emergency backup power is provided to vital facilities via portable or permanent generators, which are not part of the EDS.  Major Customers served include Family Housing, Commander Patrol Reconnaissance Wing 2, 3rd Marine Regiment, Marine Air Group 24 (MAG-24), Combat Service Support Group 3, 3rd Radio Battalion, Marine Corps Air Facility, Marine Corps Community Services, Branch Medical/Dental Clinic, Mokapu Elementary School, and Unaccompanied Personnel Housing.  Main facilities at MCBH Kaneohe Bay include a rifle range, aircraft hangars, headquarters and administrative facilities, ground unit maintenance facilities, training facilities, warehouse facilities, mess hall, exchange, child development center, Mokapu Elementary School, police/fire/medical facilities, gymnasium, golf course, ball fields, approximately 2000 family housing units, approximately 36 Bachelor Enlisted Quarters buildings, airstrip operations, wastewater plant, water pumping, commissary and various food service facilities.

Wastewaster System

Wastewater is collected through an extensive sewerage system throughout MCBH Kaneohe Bay and is delivered to the Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) for secondary treatment.  The plant is designed for an average daily flow of 2.0 million gallons per day (mgd).  Current flow to the plant averages 1 mgd.  Areas not served by the centralized collection system use cesspools.  The remainder is pumped to the effluent pump station of the City and County of Honolulu Kailua Wastewater Treatment Plant for conveyance to the Mokapu Deep Ocean Outfall.   The New Owner is prohibited from using chlorine gas at the WRF.  The wastewater system includes approximately:  30 miles of gravity sewer and force main, 750 manholes, 19 pump stations, secondary treatment facility, reclaimed water pumps and transmission main, and effluent pumps and transmission main.  The system collects wastewater from residential, commercial and operational areas. Sludge is treated through an anaerobic digester followed by a decanting tank. Solids that are dried in the WRF sludge drying beds are disposed at the MCBH landfill. The WRF generates approximately 25+ dry metric tons of solids per year.  Treatment and discharge activities for the MCBH WRF are regulated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and Hawaii State Department of Health through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), permit number HI 0110078. The State of Hawaii annually inspects the WRF and collection systems. The MCBH WRF is surrounded by the environmentally sensitive areas of Kaneohe Bay and Nu’upia Pond. The effluent pipeline from the WRF to the Kailua Effluent Pump Station traverses these environmentally sensitive areas. 

RESPONSE:  The expression of interest shall, at a minimum, include following information for each system: 

(1) Company name, address, telephone and facsimile number, point of contact and email address.
(2) Interest in purchasing these utility systems at a fair market value (do not include any pricing information); 
(3) Capability and experience in ownership, operation and maintenance of similar utility systems (please include a comprehensive description of the system, the dollar value of the contract, period of performance of the contract and points of contact with telephone/facsimile numbers and email addresses); 
(4) Financial capacity to purchase, expand, maintain and operate the utility systems on a long term basis (please submit financial statements for the past 3 years and statements of cash flow projections for the next 12 months); and, 
(5) Business size of the firm (e.g., large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned, etc.). 

RESPONSE DATE:   Please respond no later than April 16, 2004, 1400 HST.  Expressions of interest may be submitted by email to pacdivutil@efdpac.navfac.navy.mil.   Please entitle your electronic submission as follows:  “HI 03-1112 MCBH Sources Sought – Wastewater System” or “HI 03-1112 MCBH Sources Sought – Electrical Distribution System” as applicable.  You may also submit expressions of interest by facsimile transmission to (808) 471-5881.  Your interest is appreciated.

<SUBJECT>Integrated Installation Information Architecture
<DESC>Future Business Opportunity Announcement Statement of Requirement: Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) has a requirement for services to support the assessment, analysis, and planning associated with the development of an Integrated Installation Information Architecture (I3A) for the Navy-wide shore installation infrastructure. Background: CNI was established in October 2003 with a clear mandate to enhance the effectiveness of shore installation management.  The current CNI business environment is comprised of nine major business areas which are further divided into 32 sub-functional areas, each with its own set of applications and data sources.  CNI is working to significantly reduce the number of its applications and associated data sources and servers.  Other major CNI and Navy initiatives are already underway that are impacting the CNI IT environment.  CNI desires to take immediate action to develop a vision for a viable I3A end state in order to ensure that, as the CNI IT environment continues to evolve, all efforts are effectively aligned. CNI Vision: CNI?s future IT architecture (I3A) will support a robust decision support capability.  It will be expected that the I3A enable the transformation of integrated data into management information, provide data accessibility and situational awareness within and across functional areas, and support improvements in business processes by making available output-driven metrics via a significantly reduced number of standard applications.  The foundation of the I3A will be an effective and efficient integration of the NMCI network with the ?to-be? CNI infrastructure. Major objectives of I3A related initiatives include, but are not limited to: 1) standardization of applications to support establishment of common business practices; 2) alignment with Federal/DOD/Navy IT initiatives, mandates, and guidelines; 3) reduction of IT infrastructure costs and the CNI total cost of managing and operating Navy shore installations; 4) enhancement of management decision support systems; and 5) establishment of authoritative data sources. The I3A initiative will be a carefully planned and phased multi-year effort. Business Opportunity: CNI requires industry expertise in the areas of IT architecture, application rationalization, server consolidation, enterprise application and sensor integration to support the transformation of CNI?s ?as-is? environment into a more effective, efficient, and integrated enterprise IT infrastructure (?to-be?).  This business opportunity is a first step.  Contractor support will be required to: 1) conduct an analysis and assessment of the ?as-is? CNI IT environment in order to create an understanding of the relationship between business processes, applications, and organizations; 2) build on this understanding to develop a framework for the ?to-be? I3A; 3) develop a high-level migration plan using ?gap analysis? or other analytical methods to describe the ?way ahead.?  The migration plan will be supported by prioritized, actionable work packages that provide sufficient information for CNI to make implementation decisions.  Specific attention to identification or development of standards or criteria for sensor integration will be required.  The contractor will also perform analysis related to server consolidation planning and develop an approach that enables CNI to initiate actions that align with evolving Navy plans.  During the performance of work, the successful bidder will be required to integrate and work with other government organizations and support contractors engaged in supporting ongoing Navy and CNI IT initiatives. Contractual Approach: The planned acquisition strategy for this initial effort will be a competition among existing GSA Schedule holders, which will result in an award of an FFP order for a six-month period of performance.  At completion and acceptance of the contract deliverables, CNI will assess the viability of the solutions offered and formulate a plan to execute the CNI I3A initiative. Pre-Solicitation Conference: To further publicize and clarify the scope of the CNI I3A initiative, a ?Pre-Solicitation? Conference will be held on Thursday, 25 March 2004, from 1000 ? 1300 at the Crystal City Hilton Hotel.  Further information concerning the CNI IT Initiative and contractual approach associated with this FBO will be presented.  Additionally, a brief presentation of the current CNI IT projects and other identified government IT initiatives which will impact the CNI I3A initiative will be provided.  A question and answer session will follow. Further detailed information on this conference will be posted on the CNI Clearinghouse website.

<SUBJECT>D -- Industry Day Conference Announcement Federal Asset Sales (FAS) Real Property e-gov initiative
<DESC>Industry Day Conference Announcement Federal Asset Sales (FAS) Real Property e-gov initiative

On April 5, 2004 starting 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. the General Services Administration will hold an industry day conference providing details on the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) Real Property e-gov initiative at the American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292.  The purpose of the briefing will be to provide potential commercial sector bidders with an overview of the FAS Real Property egov business case analysis, program objectives, and the upcoming schedule for the solicitation and award regarding the disposition of federal real property assets.  All prospective contractors are encouraged to attend. Background:  Conceived in November of 2001 by the Quicksilver E-Government Task Force, the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) program is designed to improve and optimize the way that the federal government reuses and disposes of all types of federally owned assets, including real property and personal property.  Each year the Federal Government disposes of and sells billions of dollars of surplus under- and un-utilized property and forfeited assets. Today’s government real estate sales activities can be improved, via e-commerce and other process enhancements, to maximize the government’s net sales proceeds while increasing sales velocity, and by facilitating the active participation and bidding by citizens. FAS seeks the services of a Service Aggregator (SA) that can assist Federal agencies with selling and disposing of real property assets, including the strategic planning and analysis necessary to maximize net sales proceeds and accelerate disposal velocity. Although the SA will have the responsibility of determining the most appropriate method(s) for selling agencies’ excess real property, its level of autonomy may depend on the SA-proposed business model chosen to dispose of the specific property. The SA will work closely with agencies to develop the necessary marketing and disposal plans in order to most effectively and efficiently dispose of their property.  Sales disposition alternatives can include public outcry, sealed bid, and online marketplaces.  In some situations, agencies may empower the SA with the autonomy to invest in a property and otherwise make strategic asset and portfolio decisions designed to maximize sales proceeds and accelerate disposal.  This solicitation is focusing on three component services: Sales Solution Development (One-Time Creation of the efficient Marketplace solution); Marketplace Operations (Continuous sales transactions through multiple online, offline, and simulcast auction Marketplaces); and Value-Added Services (VAS) Operations (Provide interested agencies with optional services to strategically analyzed disposition options, channel and parcel assets to the most effective online/offline sales venues, and support pre- and post-sales activities). 

These optional VAS may include but are not limited to: Refinement of Asset Descriptions and Standardization of Asset Conditions, Strategic Analysis of Property Disposition Alternatives, Buyer Qualification, Property Due Diligence, Bid Deposits, Property Marketing, Conveyance Document Preparation, Site Inspection Support, Zoning, Parceling, Asset Valuation and Appraisals, Maintenance and Upgrades, and Settlement and Closing Support. The VAS component, as proposed, will be offered to agencies in a multi-level staged approach. Each level of VAS will be optional for the agency and will be proposed based upon that agencies’ specific needs regarding property disposal. The SA will present their recommendation of VAS in its property disposal plan to the agencies. In certain instances, the SA may choose to provide the cash flows necessary to fund the VAS that will maximize net sales proceeds. This optional multi-level staged approach will allow agencies and the SA to work together to determine the most appropriate actions needed to improve the efficiency of the federal real property disposal process and offer the opportunity to maximize net sales proceeds while accelerating sales velocity.  While the typical sales transaction will have the objective of selling the property immediately, in certain instances the SA may provide strategic recommendations, either from a portfolio sales perspective or based on asset-specific situations, that are designed to maximize sales proceeds.
 Capability Statement:  The Successful awardee and its sub-contractors must have a broad range of capabilities for fulfilling the needs and outcomes of the FAS initiative. Successful Offeror will:  Perform marketing analysis and advertising; effectively channel and parcel (where appropriate) property to the most beneficial sales venue; charge competitive and reasonable rates for real property sales channels and services; provide strategic VAS as listed above, use established channels (i.e. e-Marketplaces and a network of VAS providers) to leverage existing commercial best practices, and create new channels as appropriate; market to Federal Agencies, buyers, and new or emerging marketplaces; provide buyer and agency customer service and sales management; and  supporting the disposition of additional properties.  FAS’ Real Property Objectives:  Increase agencies net proceeds from real property sales when appropriate, while increasing sales velocity; help federal agencies determine the most effective channel available for real property sales; decrease agencies’ expenses related to real property sales; and make it easier for citizens, businesses, and government agencies to find and buy government real property assets.  Conference Address:  1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292. Point of Contact: Kathy W. Corley, Real Property Asset Class Manager, Kathy.Corley@gsa.gov.  RSVP required via email to the POC by 12:30 EST, Thursday, April 1st with notice of your intent to be present at the conference.

<SUBJECT>J -- Provide Tower Space and Maintenance Services for the NOAA Weather Radio System in the State of Alabama
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) to negotiate with the Alabama Educational Television Commission, located at 2112 11th Avenue South, Suite 400, Birmingham, AL  35205-2284, for tower space and preventative and remedial maintenance of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at seven (7) AETC owned and operated tower sites located in Alabama in 
Anniston, Demopolis, Montgomery, Florence, Huntsville, Louisville, and Dozier.  In addition, AETC, will provide the same maintenance services in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa at non-AETC tower sites.  Tower space at these two sites are contracted by NWS separately.  Each of these sites have limited access.  The separate contracts permit AETC access for maintenance services only.   BACKGROUND: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA’s NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate requires uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Since 1978, the State of Alabama has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and AETC. SCOPE: This procurement is for a follow-on contract for tower space and maintenance services.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a three month base period of performance, followed by four 1-year option periods, followed by one 9-month option period for a total of 5 years. SOLE SOURCE: NOAA/NWS has determined that AETC is the only contractor that can provide 1) tower space on strategically located towers and allow for placement of antennas at the needed heights to provide the required NWR broadcast service coverage. 2) AETC is the only contractor that can provide the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year maintenance services since no other contractor can have access to the towers and equipment for maintenance after hours due to Homeland Security issues. Since outages and emergencies can occur at any time day or night, access to the sites for maintenance must be available 24 hours a day. This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice. The acquisition is a commercial item acquisition. See note 22 except 45 days is changed to 15 days for commercial items/services.

<SUBJECT>C -- A/E Design and Planning Services to Update the United States Capitol Complex Master Plan
<SOLNBR>GS11P04MKC0022
<RESPDATE>030504
<CONTACT>Chrischanda Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 358-3573, Fax (202) 708-4964, Email chrischanda.smith@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), National Capital Region, Washington, D.C. announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture.  The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has selected the GSA for this procurement, which shall be conducted pursuant to the laws and regulations applicable to the AOC, and the resulting award shall be made by the AOC.  The GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Design and Planning Services to update the Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex.  The most current Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex was completed and published in 1981.  Since its completion, the 1981 master plan has unofficially guided the development of the new facilities in the Capitol Complex.  In recent years, new issues have overtaken the planning assumptions that were made in the 1970's when the current Master Plan was prepared.  Proactive planning to increase safety and security has been the highest priority in the wake of emergency situations that have impacted the Capitol in recent years.  Historic preservation and maintenance liabilities have evolved over the past 30 years to new benchmarks requiring a coordinated approach to renewal and replacement.  There is a recent mandate to bring the Capitol Complex facilities into compliance with current building codes, including fire and life safety measures. Technology and telecommunications have greatly advanced the business of government, and plans are needed to fully integrate this modern infrastructure into the existing buildings.  New facilities to meet the needs of Congress and many of its support functions are under consideration.  In addition to these issues, the Capitol Complex Master Plan will address the location, massing and image of new proposed developments, consider the potential traffic/transportation/parking issues, incorporate landscape/open space/park planning, develop environmental sustainability principles and practices, formulate and development proposals and compatibilities with surrounding development initiatives of the District of Columbia and the Regional Planning Agency.  The updated Capitol Complex Master Plan will be prepared for the Architect of the Capitol and be developed in consultation with Congress, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and other key tenants of the Capitol Complex.  The Master Plan will be updated in accordance with AOC quality standards and requirements.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: (1) A complete review of the principles and outcomes of the 1981 Master Plan which would involve evaluation of each of the Planning Principles contained in the 1981 Master Plan, an assessment of the influence and longevity of these principles on subsequent initiatives, and the relevance of the principles in today's environment,  (2) Building of a consensus around a common vision for the Capitol, its operations and its development,  (3)  Preparation of  a succinct Vision Statement that summarizes each of four planning themes that will influence the future development of the Capitol Complex and the consensus that was reached as a result of consultations, discussions, and reviews,  (4)  Recommendation of a set of updated Planning Principles incorporating the relevant materials from the 1981 Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol and adding any new principles that are appropriate for the Master Plan update,  (5)  Development of  a facilities Plan for each jurisdiction within the Capitol complex:  Capitol, House of Representatives, Senate, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, Botanic Garden, and General Services (including US Capitol Police and several support functions) with each Facilities Plan providing a building statistics summary and utilization for each facility within the Jurisdiction's control.  The Facilities Plan for the House of Representatives has been initiated by separate contract and will be provided to the awarded A/E/Planning firm for integration with the Master Plan for the Capitol Complex.  (6) Development of a space needs assessment, deficiency report and projects facilities profile with a 10 year and a 20 year planning horizon for each Jurisdiction (the House space needs assessment will be provided from the prior study).  (7) Development of an "Area Plan" for each Jurisdiction which evaluates the infrastructure and support facilities (e.g. parking areas) and landscape improvements that are adjacent to, or a part of the Jurisdictional responsibilities, (8) Development of Precinct Plans to analyze and address issues of common concern and functionality among the Jurisdictions, and to identify specific impacts that might affect the surrounding neighborhoods.  The Precinct Plans will also identify ways to improve the symbiotic relationship of the Capitol with its neighbors, analyze the plans that have been developed by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the District of Columbia Office of Planning (DC-OP), and coordinate plans for the development of the Capitol Complex with local and regional planning initiatives, as appropriate,  (9) Development of narrative and graphic summaries for  the support functions that are served by remote offsite campuses/facilities and document the interconnecting systems (deliveries, couriers, transportation, information technology, etc.)  that connect these sites to the Capitol Complex,  (10)  Preparation of  the Capitol Complex Master Plan as a summary of the component planning that is done at the localized level, integrating the various individual planning efforts, establishing a framework for infrastructure and major land development systems, and developing an overall consolidated plan for the Capitol facilities. The Capitol Complex Master Plan will address updated Planning Principles, historic preservation and stewardship goals, traffic/transportation/circulation and parking system issues, landscape/open space/parks, environmentally sustainable principles and practices, permanent security, utilities and related infrastructure, facilities renovation and new development proposals for the Capitol Complex.

Quantities may vary. Contractors are requested to submit their proposed delivery sche dule. The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable requ ired delivery period specified above, may be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required deliver y schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply. (b) Attention is directed to the Con tract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an awa rd or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting  Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the o rdinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is l ater than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. Offerors shall submit their proposal in CD ROMs to include: Unit price of each commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main parachute canopy; Repair/Spare Pa rt(s) for the proposed item; technical drawing and hour of engineering support. Pricing for economic order quantities (i.e. 70 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1,000; 1001 Ã¢Â€Â“5,000, etc.); Completed copy of provision FAR 52.212-3, DFARS 252.212-7000; Past Performance information  (2 pages or less) describing OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s recent, relevant experience in providing similar items to Commercial/Government customers with contacts/phone numbers; proposal describing how proposed item meets requirements stated herein, include product lite rature commercially available on proposed item, and commercial warranty terms offered; Certification and testing results or analysis showing offered product meets requirements stated above; One copy of the packing and maintenance instructions for offered p roduct.  Offerors shall submit their proposals on two separate CD ROMs.  One CD shall be labeled as Techinfo and shall contain two (2) separate files containing Volumes I (Technical), and II (Past Performance). The second CD shall be labeled as CostInfo an d shall contain Volumes III (Price), and IV(Small and Small Disadvanted Business Utilization).  The electronic version shall be in Microsoft Word, Version 97/2000 or PDF (Portable Document Format) and Microsoft Excel (.xls) readable format.  The text type shall be Times New Roman, with a font size of 12.  Each page shall contain as a header the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s company name, address, solicitation number, date, volume number, and page count.  A Table of Contents for each Volume shall be provided.  OfferorÃ¢Â€Â ™s shall submit 2 CD ROMS for the Technical and Past Performance (identified as such) and 1 CD ROM for Volume III (Cost) and Volume IV (Small and Small Disadvanted Business Utilization).  Government may determine a proposal is unacceptable if proposed pric es relative to any economic ordering quantities are materially unbalanced.  A proposal may be rejected if Contracting Officer determines lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. The following Areas will be evaluated and are stated in o rder of importance (Technical is more important than Price, Past Performance and, Small and Small Disadvanted Business Utilization). (Price is more important than Past Performance and Small and Small Disadvanted Business Utilization). (Past Performance is more important than Small and Small Business Utilization). All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or pr ice.  Upon receipt, the proposals will be reviewed for completeness and compliance with the solicitation requirements.  The proposals will receive a detailed evaluation employing the criteria identified. NOTE: With regard to Area I: TECHNICAL: All initial proposals will be evaluated utilizing Factor (a) Proposed itemÃ¢Â€Â™s capability to meet synopsis requirements as demonstrated by, written proposal, product literature, computer analysis, test data, computations, other supporting data, and Factor (b) Offer or shall identify facilities and equipment to be used for commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main parachute canopy production only prior to determination of a competitive range. Factor (c) actual testing of the item, will only be utilized to evalu ate those proposals within the competitive range following said determination.  Areas to be evaluated based on a 332 lb. Mannequin less parachute system weight include ROD less than or equal to 20 fps, altitude loss to stable, oscillation angle, obstacle a voidance and subject matter expert engineer assessment of logistical/support requirements. Technical area will receive an adjectival rating of: Excellent, Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  PRICE: Pricing for economic order quantities will be averaged for evalu ation purposes only. Price for the Repair/Spare Parts will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness for each part offered as determined by the Contracting Officer.  PAST PERFORMANCE: OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s past performance with Government/Commercial customers in t he area of producing products like the commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main parachute canopy will include demonstrated technical and schedule performance, responsiveness to contract requirements, and customer satisfaction with emphasis on recen t and relevant experience.  Past Performance will be rated:  Low, Moderate, High, or Unknown, based on the relative risks associated with the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s likelihood of success in accomplishing this effort. SMALL AND SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZAT ION: The OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization will be evaluated to assess the extent to which the Offeror identifies and commits to the use of Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and U niversities, and/or minority institutions for performance of this effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  This area will be evaluated in accordance with DFAR 219.704 and AFARS Appendix DD. This requirement is not applica ble to Small Business Concerns. Government anticipates evaluation testing of main canopies to begin 30 days after selection of viable candidates.  Offerors must be present for 5 of the 6 days of drops.  Offerors will arrive with the systems packed.  Drops will occur in the morning with repacking etc. occurring in the afternoon.  Offerors will leave on the 5th day leaving a packed system for testing on the 6th day.  While at the evaluation site, no offeror personnel will be allowed on the flight line or the drop zone since competing  commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main parachute canopies will be loaded, dropped and recovered on the same flight mission.  The intent is to prevent any offeror from observing, up close, the design of their competitorÃ ¢Â€Â™s commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main canopy.  The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent is to have color-coded badges for all personnel who are supporting the pre-award test program.  A specific color will be given to one offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s personnel.  A  different color will be assigned for other offerors.  Specific areas will be identified for each offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s operations, and will be secured by the assigned offeror.  Offerors will be restricted to the area assigned to them. Government personnel will b e issued badges with a color assigned to that group of personnel.  Government personnel will be allowed on the flight line and drop zone if their official dutie s require access to these areas.  Government contractor support personnel will be issued badges with a color, which identifies them as Government contractor support personnel.  Before issuing any badges to Government contractor support, each individual wil l be required to sign a Ã¢Â€ÂœProcurement Integrity Statement and Certification Concerning Nondisclosure and Outside Financial Interest FormÃ¢Â€Â.  As with Government employees, Government contractor support personnel will be permitted on the flight line and drop zone, only if their official work assignment requires their presence at that location.  Offerors will be able to participate in the pre-flight briefings held prior to an actual airdrop mission.  Post drop test results reviews will not be open to o fferor personnel.  Government personnel will recover the systems from the drop zone, and return them to the specific offeror area for offeror servicing and repack. Government will not be liable for any damages to main parachute canopies during testing.  Of ferors are cautioned that their product must comply with Berry Amendment restrictions (See DFARS Clause 252-225-7012) in order to receive award.  Contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal and product represents the best overall value to the  Government based on the Areas stated within 90 days after the start of evaluation testing. To receive consideration for award, overall evaluations of not less than Acceptable must be achieved in all Areas. An evaluation rating of Unacceptable at the Area level will cause the entire Proposal to be evaluated as Unacceptable. This is a best value acquisition. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest-priced offeror.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH) on behalf of the Specialized Information Services (SIS) division to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Insuractive, Inc, Virginia.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire professional services to support NLM’s Tox Town web site.  The period of performance is for a base period of one (1) year with two one-year option periods.

Specifically, the contractor shall: (1) Develop interface concepts – The contractor shall draw on discussions with SIS staff and a review of current children-focused web sites to develop a pictorial user interface depicting a game-like scenario that highlights everyday and commonly encountered chemical substances.  Product-to-be-delivered will include an information presentation of ideas and will include simple conceptual sketches to illustrate ideas.  Experience with development of multi-media web applications and experience in working with biomedical content is required.  In addition, familiarity with SIS databases is desirable because integration with the other SIS databases will be a component of this concept. (2) Chemical-oriented scenario and prototype user interface – Based on direction from the government, the contractor shall develop a storyboard(s) with artist drawings/sketches to support a children’s chemical-based scenario for “Tox Mysteries”.  Development of the storyboard will be through an iterative design process, working closely with the government information specialists.  If the storyboard design is approved for implementation, then the contractor will develop a web-based prototype of the scenario.  Formal training in Fine Arts as well as experience in rendering drawings in the digital web environment is required.  Experience in teaching and preparation of educational materials is highly desirable.  Experience in development of children’s education computer games or interactive, learning web sites is required.  Expertise in programming and software design and development, plus state-of-the-art multimedia IT technologies used in software development is also required (e.g., Flash, Java programming language).  Experience in development of biomedical application, particularly with chemical-oriented focus is highly desirable.  (3) Consulting services for information visualization – The contractors shall provide consulting services as needed related to the implementation of the SIS Information Visualization plan and other tasks and projects associated with SIS responsibilities with respect to visualization.  Expertise in multimedia technologies and graphic design is required for this task.
 
NLM has determined that Insuractive, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  The company has working knowledge and experience with chemical and biomedical applications.  The staff includes Ms. Mary Higgins who was the original web developer and creator of the Tox Town graphic portal developed for NLM.  Ms. Higgins, as the system architect, has an in-depth understanding of the computer architecture of this software and a demonstrated knowledge of the environmental health content related to this application.  Her involvement in the conceptual design and initial implementation of Tox Town gives her a unique understanding of the application.

This proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within seven (7) calendar days from the publication date of this notice (modified - new due date for capability statements being submitted in reference to this requirement will be due on April 2, 2004).  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-099/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the following questions we have received:

Question 1:  Is it required to have a GSA Schedule?  Answer 1:  No, we did not solicit through the GSA Schedules.  Question 2:  We provided a response to the RFI for solicitation number: EDOFSA-04-000375 with your organization.  In the follow-up solicitation notice it was stated that:  "Federal Student Aid (FSA) has completed its market research on training registration systems/services, including conversations with select companies who submitted information in response to our Request for Information that was posted February 2-6, 2004."  Does this mean that the companies that were selected via contact have an award consideration?  Or were they contacted because their solution was more advantageous for the Department of Education, Federal Student Aid?  Was the contact similar to a down select?  Answer 2:  The RFI was not a solicitation and so indicated.  The quoted language from the only solicitation issued for this requirement means what is says – "Federal Student Aid (FSA) has completed its market research on training registration systems/services, including conversations with select companies who submitted information in response to our Request for Information that was posted February 2-6, 2004."  Conversations with select companies means we sought additional information from a subset of RFI responders.  We took this step for the same purpose as all other market research steps – to make the Department an educated consumer.  The only competition being held in regards to an FSA Registration solution is the current one EDOFSA-04-000375 and, as such, no down selection has occurred.  Question 3: Will the contractor provide hosting services for the application or will it be deployed on government's infrastructure?  Answer 3: The offeror should propose what they think the best solution would be.  Question 4:  For "Offerors are to provide access to a demonstration site accessible via Internet Explorer 6.0 from FSA which demonstrates the functionality outlined in this solicitation. Offerors are to explain the process and timeframe to transition and implement the solution they propose."  Does the government want a site which guides the user through the demo or does the government want the contractor to provide: 1)  a link to a functioning registration form; and 2) access to the Administrative interface to view how to process registrations?  Answer 4:  The Government needs access to a site which guides the user through the demo.  We want to see what the customer will see.  Once a particular system is chosen, then the Government would want to know all about the administrative side.  Question 5:  Our technology is new, and we believe it has significant flexibility and other advantages over conventional software packages.  However, since it is new, we cannot address:  "Offerors are required to submit at least three references for evaluation of past performance of same or similar services or items which have been successfully completed by the offeror within the past two (2) years".  Does that rule us out as the main provider?  If so, we would be interested in subcontracting for a modeling phase of the work. Answer 5:   Vendors without a record of past performance will be rated as neutral for this criteria/factor.  Question 6:  Does the 10 page limit include the Cost Proposal? Does the 10 page limit include the Cover Page. Does the 10 Page limit include a Table of Contents?  Answer 6:  The ten page limitation is the limitation set up for your technical portion of your quote.  If you choose to provide a cover page and a table of contents then they will count against your ten page limitation.  Question 7:  Is this web site to be hosted by the Department of Education or the Contractor?  Answer 7:  That is up to the offeror to propose in their quote.  Question 8:  Will the contractor be required to provide hardware (i.e. servers) and software (i.e. SQL Server, ColdFusion, iPlanet) or will the Dept of Ed provide?  Answer 8:  That is up to the offeror to propose in their quote.   Question 9:  Do we need to include the cost of the hardware/software in our proposal? Answer 9:  Yes, we are asking for cost information to be part of your quote submission.   Question 10:  Is the time for submission of the above referenced solicitation EST?  Answer 10:  Yes.  Question 11:  Technical portion of Quotes shall be no longer than ten (10) pages in length; two-page description of effort and contact information shall be provided for each Past Performance reference.  Does this mean that of your technical portion submitted, six pages of it will be past performance information?  Answer 11:  Yes.  Question 12:  How many years is this for?  The RFQ does not mention period of performance or option years.  Answer 12:  The base period of performance is from the date of award of the contract for 12 months with 2 one-year option periods. The services performed during the option periods will be the same as in the base period.  The following provisions/clauses are included by reference and apply to this solicitation:  52.217-5, Evaluation of Options and 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract--(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 1 year; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 36 months. 

ED will accept clarification questions until 11:00 AM EST on Friday, March 26.  After this date, ED does not guarantee that a response will be given.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS05, and to correct a clerical error in Amendment 0001 to the referenced RFP.
1.0. Reference Paragraph 2 of Amendment 0001 to RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS05.  Offerors interested in attending the site visit referenced in Amendment 0001 shall provide a list of attendees to the NRL-SSC Contracting Office Point of Contact no later than close of business 25 MAR 2004.  The Security Office point of contact telephone number for visitor processing is 202-404-6179.  2.1. Question 1: Can we obtain the existing schematics and plumbing diagrams for the vacuum chambers? Answer 1: If necessary, the Government will respond to requests for specific drawings, diagrams, schematics, etc., after the scheduled site visit.  2.2.  Question 2: Since a PROCIDIA controller and Siemens display were recently implemented, are these devices to be retained and integrated into the new system? Answer 2: Not necessarily.  Proposal of solutions against the stated Government requirements are solely the responsibility of the offeror.  2.3. Question 3: Is there a preference in using Siemens vs. Allen-Bradley? Answer 3: No.  2.4.  Question 4: What are the normal ambient temperatures and humidity levels where the PCs are to reside? Answer 4: Conditions associated with a normal office environment.  2.5.  Question 5: Does this work include supplying new electrical enclosures with contactors, relays, etc. to run the equipment?  If not, is the current control system located in the enclosures along with the connectors and relays. Answer 5: Yes, as required.  2.6. Question 6: Our control scheme would be based on using a programmable controller to provide direct control of the equipment, with the PC acting as the MMI.  Would you entertain an optional price by having one PLC control all three vacuum chambers in an effort to reduce cost?  There would still be a PC at each chamber.  Answer 6: Refer to the Requirements.  Proposal of solutions against the stated Government requirements are solely the responsibility of the Offeror.  2.7. Question 7: Is it correct that all of the existing thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow meters are not to be replaced? Answer 7: No.
2.8. Question 8: Is the work on-site to be performed by union or non-union labor? Answer 8: The Government has no preference for either union or non-union labor for this acquisition.  2.9. Question 9: What hours and days are available for work on-site? 
Answer 9: 0630–2100, Monday through Friday.  Also see the publication entitled REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-SITE CONTRACTORS, available at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/9onsite.htm
2.10. Question 10: Can the work be performed on all vacuum chambers simultaneously or do we need to phase in each system individually? Answer 10: South and Big Blue are tied together and would need to be done at the same time.  North could be done separately.  2.11. Question 11: Under Requirement Item F) the solicitation states that the Acoustic chamber controls shall be moved.  What is the acoustic chamber and associated controls? Is this chamber one of the other chambers mentioned in the solicitation or is it separate? Answer 11:The Acoustic controls consist of Blower Start Switch, Nitrogen Flow Start Switch, and a Burner start switch that controls a sub-X nitrogen vaporizer.
2.12. Question 12: Are there drawings, plans, schematics, etc. available for the current control arrangements and facilities to facilitate accurate bids? Answer 12: Yes.  See 2.1, above.
2.13. Question 13: Is there currently a time scheduled for on-site surveys by potential bidders? Answer 13: See Amendment 0001 to this RFP and 1.0, above.  2.14.

Statement of Objectives
Asbestos Labeling 
Altus AFB, Oklahoma

1.	Background
Past building inspections have identified asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in many facilities at Altus AFB (AAFB).  These inspections were conducted utilizing the Air Force Guidance for Rating and Assessing Damage and Exposure (GRADE) System, USAFOEHL Report 89-072EH0021HGA.    Current records indicate approximately 47 facilities at AAFB have mechanical rooms containing ACM.  Many of the GRADE 1 or 2 materials are known to be located in crawlspaces, attics, or other confined areas.  Re-assessment of the condition of these materials was performed in 2003.  
Information developed during the 1995 inspections has been input into an in-house database system known as Personal Computer View 3 (PCV3) for managing both asbestos and lead-based paint (LBP).  Altus AAFB has converted this database to an ACCESS based database.  The 2003 reassessment is contained in a separate report maintained by 97 CES/CEV. 
2.	Objectives
The objective for this project is to label all ACM located in the mechanical rooms in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001 (j) (4).2.1	Labeling of ACM in the Mechanical Rooms
The Base will provide a list of targeted facilities requiring labeling.  The Base will provide the contractor with the latest asbestos data on all targeted facilities.  This data will be in either electronic form data or hard copy form dependent on the needs of the contractor.
Contractor will develop plan for labeling all identified ACM within the mechanical.  This plan will be submitted to the base for review to ensure access to all facilities can be coordinated in a timely manner. 
Contractor will provide requested information to AAFB on all visiting contractors, prior to arrival, to allow for security clearances to be conducted.
Contractor will perform the requested labeling of those materials agreed on by both the contractor and the base.
2.3	Reports

·	Altus AFB will provide information on the known current status of asbestos material not in the existing database.
·	Altus AFB will provide a list of the approximately 47 facilities containing ACM within the mechanical rooms.  
·	Altus AFB will assign a project liaison to assist the Contractor in gaining access to restricted, locked, or otherwise inaccessible areas within each facility where re-assessment will be conducted.
