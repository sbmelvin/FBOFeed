<DESC>The Air Force Surgeon General's Office, in conjunction with the Office of Homeland Security, has a requirement to obtain expert medical consultation services on public health disease using epidemiological and public health methodology surveillance, analysis, and reporting of disease outbreaks, applying Center for Disease Control (CDC), Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) and public health and procedures.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Air Force Surgeon General's Office, in conjunction with the Office of Homeland Security, in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.   The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ScenPro Inc. for this requirement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii).  ScenPro Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the products and services.  SCENPRO personnel have extensive experience with the AFMS and its deployment of Silent Guardian I.  This experience includes familiarity with the ABI 7900 HT fast real-time Prilimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system that can simultaneously test eight (8) patients for 20 pathogens on the Advanced Technology Concept Demonstration (ACTD) list of pathogens for diagnostic and surveillance assay development within four hours.  The test results data will be web-based, enabling integration between the USAF and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  This experience is unique to SCENPRO as the only current contractor capable of providing this expertise to DoD through their cooperative effort with Applied Biosystems (ABI), the developer of the PCR capability.    Applied Biosystems (ABI) is the unique provider of the fast real-time PCR capability.  As discussed in Paragraph X, Interested Sources, a notice of contract action will be posted.  Interested parties will be given appropriate time to respond if they feel they can offer the same or similar capability.  However, the ABI system is proprietary and is the system used by the AF SGR during Silent Guardian I.  Applied Biosystems' technology is the most mature technology currently available for fast, real-time surveillance of biological threats such as Avian Flu.  Award to another company or seeking a competitive acquisition would result in substantial harm to the Government, as it would significantly delay the Air Force's ability to monitor for the infectious and potentially deadly influenza viruses or other deadly diseases.  SCENPRO is the only current contractor capable of providing this expertise to DoD through their cooperative effort with Applied Biosystems (ABI), the developer of the PCR capability.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  If you have questions or comments, please email Louis.williams@mms.gov by COB March 17, 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center (USGS) has a requirement for the collection, processing, and dissemination of satellite tracking data using the Argos Data Collection and Locating System (DCLS).  The goal of this project is to satellite-track a variety of free-ranging wildlife species worldwide using contemporary transmitters and receivers that are based on Doppler-shift principles. Since 1985, scientists now affiliated with the USGS' Alaska Science Center have conducted satellite tracking studies of numerous free-ranging arctic wildlife populations to ascertain new knowledge about their annual migrations, seasonal distributions, and population status.  Satellite tracking allows data collection that is safer and more cost-efficient than traditional aircraft radio-tracking missions, and satellite tracking is not constrained by political borders, weather, and daylight.  For large to medium-sized animals (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, etc.), satellite tracking has evolved from experimental to operational in terms of transmitter technology and predictable project success.  Continuing developments in reducing transmitter size and extending transmitter life-span continue to afford new possibilities for acquiring scientific information about species of concern to USGS clients.  To this end, it is expected that satellite tracking will continue to be a fundamental tool for wildlife research at the Alaska Science Center for many years to come.   The USGS is contemplating an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of five (5) years.  Under this IDIQ, task orders will be issued for each individual researcher and/or project that requires satellite tracking services.  The sum of these task orders over the five year period will not exceed $400,000.00.   CLS America, Inc. (formerly Service Argos, Inc.) of Largo, MD, the North American subsidiary of Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS), owns and operates the satellite receivers that are fundamental to tracking wildlife using the Doppler-shift principles and the aforementioned transmitter technologies.  Therefore, the USGS intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with CLS America, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming solicitation (06WRSS0006) will be made available through the GPE, whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified.   For further information or to obtain a copy of the proposed Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort, please contact Jeff Caravelli at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health,  Office of the Director to procure genetic testing from the University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory.  

Since 1996, the primary mission of the University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory has been to develop and implement genetic testing for rare genetic disease.  The CLIA certified laboratory uses cutting edge technology for the development of genetic tests.  It has implemented denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing for the mutation analysis of certain genes.  In addition, staff has developed and validated tests based on techniques such as real-time PCR and multiplex ligation probe amplification for gene deletion analysis (e.g. imprinting center deletion analysis, MECP2 deletion analysis and deletion analysis of X-linked genes in females) that are used on a clinical basis.  This allows for comprehensive testing for various rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases, especially cortical malformation, and brain developmental and growth and overgrowth disorders.  This Service is Commercially Available.

The following information may be entered into a notice of intent synopsis for a noncompetitive (sole source) acquisition:

1.	The Contractor period of performance shall be one year from the date of award.

2.		The Contractor shall be experienced in developing genetic tests for other 	lissencephaly and cortical malformation disorders as they become identified.  

3.		The Contractor shall provide comprehensive testing (mutation and deletion 	analysis of the NSD1 gene) for Sotos syndrome. 

4.		The Contractor shall be a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist with at least 	8 years experience in the field.

5.		The Contractor’s primary focus shall be on neurogenetic disorders, with an 	emphasis on cortical malformations, growth and overgrowth disorders, and 	disorders of brain development.

6.		The Contractor shall, depending on the complexity of the test and test issues, 	develop four to six tests within one year after award.

7.		The Contractor shall, once the tests are available to the public, provide structured 	feedback to ORD about the use of each test for five years.

8.	The Contractor’s laboratory staff shall develop a report mechanism and 
	report for five years to the Office of Rare Diseases on the numbers of  tests 	undertaken for each rare genetic rare condition.  That report shall address:

	.	Who requested the test,
	.	What queries the laboratory received on the understandability of the test,
	.	Who had questions about the test and/or test results (e.g. healthcare provider or patient/family), 
	.	What kind of questions were asked,
	.	Any other information that would be helpful to know for ORD to improve the future process of developing tests for rare genetic diseases.

8.		The Contractor shall identify the need and content for additional or different 	educational materials.

It is the Government’s belief that these requirements may only be met by the University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory.  This is not a formal solicitation, however, concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above.  Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.  Information furnished shall include enough material to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Manufacturing Technology Division of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, (AFRL/MLM ) solicits research proposals for  the Affordable Weapons' Datalink Insertion (AWDI) Program.  The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate and implement advanced Manufacturing processes and practices that demonstrably reduce cost and mfg. cycle times associated with the transition of emerging weapon data link systems into Air Force munitions SDD/LRIP/FRP programs.   Focus will be toward the pursuit of aggressive product and process technologies that can dramatically reduce WDL fly away costs from their current baseline to below $5000/unit by FY10.  The primary transition target for this effort is Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB-II).  However, solution applicability to multiple systems is a premium and interim transition onto other PGM systems (i.e. JASSM) prior to FY10 is also highly desirable.  A successful program will result in commitment to fully implement the developed processes and practices as well as a transition plan with SPO buy-in to incorporate the improved WDL product and processes onto their respective system.   . Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA  solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/.

<ARCHDATE>06162006
<CONTACT>Harrison Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-2314, Email harrison.smith@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been tasked to ensure that the United States remains safe from attack by the illicit importation, development, or procurement of a nuclear or radiological device.  In recognition of the catastrophic risk posed by the use of a nuclear weapon within the United States, DHS has integrated all nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support into a single office: the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.  The DNDO will develop the global nuclear detection architecture; conduct research and development; and acquire and support the deployment of the domestic nuclear detection system.
The DNDO established the Office of Transformational Research and Development (OTR&D) to conduct, support, coordinate, and encourage an aggressive transformational program of Research and Development (R&D) that will dramatically improve national capabilities to detect and report attempts to import or transport a nuclear device, Special Nuclear Material (SNM), or radiological materials intended for illicit use.
Towards this end, OTR&D is conducting an aggressive program of exploratory research to make significant advances in basic detection technology and to reduce the costs and manpower required.  Priority is placed on R&D that has the greatest enabling potential for filling the capability gaps in the nuclear detection architecture.  Transformational R&D will undertake those efforts that dramatically improve system performance and reduce technical, performance and/or cost risks in achieving DNDO objectives by bringing innovative new concepts to a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration before transitioning them to a more advanced technology demonstration or a final commercial system development phase.
DNDO is soliciting proposals under the attached Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Transformational Research and Development in Nuclear Detection Technology that directly supports the DNDO mission.  Specifically, this BAA solicits proposals in the following areas of Exploratory Research (ER): Innovative Detection Materials, Innovative Detection Techniques, Advanced Special Nuclear Material (SNM) Interrogation and Verification, and Algorithm Development.  The Government encourages participation from private industry, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations.  The submission deadline for (optional) white papers is March 30, 2006, and for full technical and cost proposals is June 1, 2006.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) BAA 06-23, Super Resolution Vision System (SRVS); CLOSING DATE: 3 March 2007; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12:00 NOON (EST), 17 April 2006; POC:  Dr. Jennifer Ricklin, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA 06-23@darpa.mil; Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/SRVS/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for  the Super Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program.

The objective of the SRVS program is to design, build, and field a prototype man-portable optical system that will credibly extend the range for target recognition and identification over existing systems.  The key technical innovation is to exploit an atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon that creates high-resolution “lucky” image regions through collection of a stream of high-speed images to generate better-than diffraction limited images.   DARPA is interested in proposals that utilize state-of-the-art optical and computational technologies to exploit this turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon, which will facilitate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces.  Proposals must culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype system scaled to in-service system size, weight and power. 

DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

Primary technical challenges include the development of image quality computational algorithms for on-the-fly local image quality analysis and fusion (image quality map estimation and fusion of “lucky” high-resolution image regions); rapid, on-the-fly local region shift/jitter removal combined with on-the-fly “lucky” region fusion; image stabilization and local image shifts removal; and the interface between the high-speed camera and computational hardware. Integration challenges include incorporating the resulting system into a compact, man-portable package; system size, weight and power; power management (use of standard batteries); and environmental packaging.

The SRVS program will build and test a field prototype man-portable optical system that will:
•	Credibly demonstrate improved recognition range over existing systems
•	Be less than 2 kilograms
•	Be less than 35 cm in length
•	Have an optical aperture less than 6 cm.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn: BAA 06-23) on or before 12:00 NOON (EST), 17 April 2006.   

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 105-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA; the Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received.

DESCRIPTION

The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new proposals for PREventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT). This will be a highly aggressive program aimed at protecting our warfighters from traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from explosions, such as those from an improvised explosive device (IED). The first phase will be a six month period with the goal of identifying the mechanisms, physical and biological, which cause the injury. The second phase will include development of medical treatments and protective countermeasures that directly address the cause of injury as well as further refinement of the models predicting the injury. 

BACKGROUND

The focus of this program is on traumatic brain injuries that result from non-kinetic explosive effects resulting in non-penetrating brain injuries. Although previous efforts to understand such injuries have focused on a single explanation, blast overpressure, it appears that IED- induced injuries in Iraq cannot be completely explained by blast overpressure alone. Thus, proposals must fully consider all physical forces associated with blast exposure that could potential explain the observed pattern of neurologic injuries. Factors which must be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:  blast overpressure, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), thermal shock, chemical components, and shockwave.  Additionally, proposers must consider the mechanisms of action across multiple biological scales, and the range of injuries incurred from those interactions (for example, apoptosis, cell lysis, edema, gliosis, impaired neurogenesis, and perturbation of biochemical and physical function through disruption of neural signaling and vascular perfusion, etc). 

Phase I of this program will comprehensively evaluate the physics of interaction between an IED blast and the neurological system and determine which component(s) are causally associated with neurologic injury. Phase I will also establish the general neurological injury mechanisms resulting from blast exposure. It is expected that the development of test systems and predictive models will be required to characterize the modalities, methods and results of interaction subsequent to blast exposure in order to optimize treatment paradigms, explosive blast mitigation, and protective strategies in Phase II. The phase I milestones shall be the description of physical, biological and molecular mechanisms that result in observed neurological injury. Phase II of this program shall focus on prevention of injury and guide the development of passive and active mitigation strategies, the engineering and development of personal protective armor, and therapeutic interventions for those injured. 


Programs should generate a nominal model in Phase I with the following characteristics: 

1.	Addresses mechanisms of explosive blast injury at the molecular as well as the macroscopic scales including, but not limited to cellular, tissue level, organ level, and organ system level.
2.	Characterizes the injury over the pathophysiological evolution ranging from primary injury resulting directly from the insult, to the consequent secondary pathophysiological cascade, extending beyond biogenic responses into psychogenic outcomes.
3.	Isolates the spectrum of physical mechanisms in explosion environments and determine their coupled or potentially uncoupled effects on the central nervous system (CNS) by utilizing appropriate model studies.
4.	Verified against data observed from in vivo specimens. 

Models should be able to replicate:

•	Histology
&#61607;	apoptosis following initial injury
&#61607;	axonal damage and degradation 
&#61607;	microscopic necrosis
&#61607;	indications of microvascular disruption or abnormality
•	Epidemiology 
&#61607;	grading the severity of injury at various ranges and levels of exposure
•	Cognitive impairment
&#61607;	appetite
&#61607;	ability to perform cognitive tasks
•	Functional impairment 
&#61607;	sleep 
&#61607;	gait and movement patterns


In addition, models should be able to explain injuries sustained through repeated exposure to indirect forces created by explosion and cognitive deficits that occur even when subjects are directly shielded from the outputs of explosions but still exposed to potentially reflected energies (e.g., behind walls or around corners). 

Finally, it is critical that models are correlated with clinical observations of injury in military personnel returning from theater. Proposals that do not specifically address the pattern of injuries observed in the warfighter population will not be considered. 


PROPOSAL PROCESS

Programs should be submitted as twenty four month efforts encompassing both Phase I (6 mos.) and an optional phase II (18 mos.).  At the end of phase I, there will be a downselect. In order to be considered for phase II, performers must have demonstrated replication of injury specific to the model guidelines provided above. Proposals must include an outline of a both phase I and phase II budgets that includes resources, labor, and material to complete this task. 

Successful proposals must have an identified systems integrator (SI). The SI will lead a multi-disciplinary team of performers who can meet the milestones, including both the ability to characterize the explosive environment, characterize the injury resulting from exposure to one or more of the components of the explosive environment, develop predictive models and create mitigation and treatment strategies. As such, successful team composition should include, but is not limited to, specialists from the medical and physical sciences as well as the mathematical and engineering sciences. In addition, team members with the capability to innovate, design, and fabricate sophisticated instrumentation, sensors, and material systems may also enable programmatic success. 

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  


1. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT

The objective of this criterion is to assess the extent to which the proposer has an innovative, high payoff, and comprehensive technical approach based on sound scientific principles. 

Proposals will be evaluated as follows: The effort will add to understanding of neuro-trauma resulting from physical forces occurring in an explosion with potential for advances to the prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injury. It will include an exploration and assessment of the current state of the art. The approach matches program objectives. Means of mitigating, preventing, or treating TBI based on the results expected in phase I will be identified and explanation for reduction in injury through these means provided. 

2. VALUE TO DEFENSE

The objective of this criterion is to assess the extent to which the proposer has a credible and feasible scientific solution that best meets or exceeds the operational vision and provides a path of application of the technology to DoD. They must demonstrate a clear knowledge of desired military capabilities and indicate the manner in which the technology will transition.

Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Research has the potential for mitigating, preventing, and assisting in the recovery of the warfighter from blast related traumatic brain injury. Models will be relevant to clinical observations of traumatic brain injury as observed in warfighters returning from theater. 


3. CAPABILITY OF THE PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES TO PERFORM THE PROPOSED EFFORT

The objective of this criterion is to assess the extent to which the proposer’s team has the requisite experience, skills and resources necessary to perform the proposed program. This includes an assessment of the team’s management construct, key personnel, facilities and past performance in conducting similar efforts of the proposed scope.

Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Interdisciplinary composition including biology, engineering, medicine, physics, and mathematics capable of completing proposed work. Systems integrator that is present and responsible for ensuring that the team meets all milestones and metrics and integration of all proposed research. Facilities should be detailed with discussion of any unique capabilities pertinent to the research.


4. COST REALISM

The objective of this criterion is to assure that proposed cost is consistent with proposed effort. The proposed cost will be evaluated as follows: 

Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Costs are justified in relation to the scope of the proposed program. Other funding sources and activities are taken into account. A budget for an optional second phase is provided and includes justification of all costs. 

TEAMING AND INFORMATION SESSION

Teaming is encouraged, especially where interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are 
required.

A teaming and information session will be held on March 26, 2006 at the Westin Arlington Gateway. This day will provide an opportunity for those interested in proposing to seek clarification on the proposal and partnerships critical to programmatic success. A full announcement detailing meeting specifics can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/sn06-20.htm. In addition, for those unable to attend the session, notes, posters, and presentations will be made available at http://www.preventblast.com upon completion of the meeting. This will also serve as a teaming website for all interested parties. Registration is required in order to view information presented at the Teaming and Information Session website. 


PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES

Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of April 28, 2006, at 4:00 PM, ET. Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and a proposer will be notified either that: (1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or (2) the proposal has not been selected for funding. Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process. If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired. One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, including those that do not strictly adhere to the division of technical and cost sections. The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases. Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The proposer must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).

Cost or pricing data is not required if the proposer proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction). The requirements for submission of cost or pricing data are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far).

OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

TEAM COMPOSITION

Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified. The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.

Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. 

Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, 
Organizational Conflicts of Interest. Consequently, all proposers and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports and identify the prime contract numbers. Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION

Proposals that have currently identifiable commercial or military end-product are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers. The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military. Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research. This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

All proprietary information should be marked on the full proposal. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a nondisclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY appears on the cover sheet. In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 

GUIDANCE FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND DATA

The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified. 

In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.

Proposals may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). HOWEVER, DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION 
SYSTEMS. 

Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals should contact DARPA security at (571) 218-4842 (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation. Proposers must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose. 

Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award. 

Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA. An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately. 

For instructions on submitting Classified Full Proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4842.

RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN USE

Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.

For proposals involving greater than minimal risk to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve greater than minimal risk after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

<CONTACT>Irie Clarke, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1421, Irie.Clarke@HQ.DOE.GOV;Lynnette Desorcie, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1435, Lynnette.Desorcie@hq.doe.gov
<DESC>Description: The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA) intends to extend the period of performance of contract number DE-AC01-04SO20188 with CSC Systems & Solutions LLC  (CSC) on a sole source â€œbridgeâ€ basis to provide uninterrupted support while a new procurement is competed that will replace the CSC contract (a solicitation for that procurement, synopsized under solicitation number DE-RP01-06SO20218, is expected to be released in the near future).  The extension will be for two (2) three-month option periods, the first performance period  starting March 21, 2006 and the second to cover the period beginning June 21, 2006. This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(1)(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame.  To DOEâ€™s knowledge and belief, only CSC has the requisite number of â€œQâ€-cleared personnel with the highly specialized technical experience to ensure that the SSAâ€™s requirements are met within the required delivery schedules.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized technical support without interruption. The present contract with CSC ended on December 21, 2005; it was extended after issuance of a notice and review of submitted capability statements. Pursuant to a recommendation of the Government Accountability Office, DOE is re-issuing the notice with additional information and will consider the capabilities of interested sources, if any, in response to this revised notice. THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. CSC currently provides specialized technical, analytical and administrative support services in support of:  a) the development, revision, review and production of classification and control guidance; b) the development, revision, and review of policy and procedures, including supporting appraisals of the Departments classification and controls programs; c) support in the development of education coursework and the provision of training related to classification and control requirements; and d) general administrative, file room, and mail room management support involving classified materials.  All support provided is required to be in accordance with DOE Order 471.1A, Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; DOE Manual 470.4-4, Information Security; DOE Manual 475.1-1A,  Identifying Classified Information; the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, including implementing regulations; the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, including implementing regulations; Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, including implementing regulations; 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter XX, Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration; 10 CFR Part 1017, Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; and 10 CFR Part 1045, Nuclear Classification and Declassification. The level-of-effort for each three-month option period is expected to be 19,015 Direct Productive Labor Hours (38,030)  total for the six-month performance period, and is estimated to have a total ceiling price of $ 2.6 million. It is estimated that the level-of-effort will require approximately 42 full-time equivalent personnel: Key personnel: one (1) Program Manager; one (1) Senior Technical Analyst; one (1) Senior Policy Analyst; and one (1) Senior Trainer. Non-key personnel: Policy Analysts, Technical Analysts,  Administrative Assistants,  Training Specialists,  File Room Clerks,  Document Reviewers, File Room Supervisors,  Security Assistant,  and Training Assistant. All personnel performing under this effort are required to possess a current DOE â€œQâ€ access authorization (security clearance).  Personnel supporting the policy and procedures effort are required to have a high level of expertise relative to classification/declassification and  unclassified controlled information policy.  Technical personnel supporting the classification and controls effort are required to have specialized nuclear-related classification experience, and must be authorized Derivative Classifiers, Derivative Declassifiers or Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) Reviewing Officials.  Training personnel must meet similar qualifications as the classification and controls personnel, but must also have training experience in the classification and controls area.

The following areas of expertise will be required to respond to current and likely future work during the option time periods: â€¢ nuclear materials production, material control and accountability inventories/ nuclear material inventories â€¢ isotope separation technology/atomic vapor laser isotope separation technology â€¢ gaseous diffusion technology â€¢ gas centrifuge technology â€¢ proliferant enrichment technology â€¢ fissile material fuel processing â€¢ nuclear weapons design and testing â€¢ arms control and nonproliferation â€¢ radiological emergency response â€¢ radioactive dispersal devices â€¢ improvised nuclear devices â€¢ international programs such as the URENCO centrifuge â€¢ United Kingdom material transfers â€¢ North Korean nuclear activities â€¢ space nuclear reactors â€¢ safeguards and security â€¢ radioactive waste transportation â€¢ chemical/biological technology Experience with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Framemaker software will also be required. Any responding party must provide a proposal demonstrating its capability, as discussed above, which must include  the following, as these items are necessary to demonstrate that the responding party is capable of performing the contemplated work without interruption: (1)  (a) a statement that proposed personnel are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or (b) a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other synopsis of the educational and experience qualifications of personnel proposed for the contemplated work; (3) a chart or other synopsis demonstrating that proposed personnel currently hold a â€œQâ€ access authorization; (4) a copy of any teaming, subcontract, or other agreement between any parties that would be performing the contemplated work as part of a team; and (5) a certification that the responding party possesses a facility security clearance and complies with the Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) program.

<DESC>REPOSTING OF SYNOPSIS BECAUSE OF DELETION 
Synthesis of Non-GMP Small Molecules

Draft CBD Synopsis


The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is soliciting organizations with expertise in organic synthesis to perform resynthesis of compounds needed for the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID), Rapid Access to NCI Discovery Resources (R*A*N*D) programs, other NCI/NIH programs, Exploratory IND Studies or “Phase 0"clinical trials, and  biological evaluations as potential anticancer agents. http://google2.fda.gov/search?client=FDA&site=FDA&oe=&lr=&proxystylesheet=FDA&output=xml_no_dtd&getfields=*&q=G%3A%5C7086fnl.doc&as=GO
http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/7086fnl.pdf
 The offeror will synthesize target compounds as prioritized by NCI and deliver the synthesized compounds (4-8 per contract year) in amounts of 100 mg to 100 grams to the NCI repository.  An option to increase the number of compounds from 8 to a maximum of 12 assigned for synthesis (not to exceed a maximum of 12 compounds per contract year) may be included in the resultant contract. 

The Contractor will be responsible for the synthesis of both known and new compounds as requested by NCI, and the shipments of compounds in required amounts to the NCI repository.  The synthesis assignments will include syntheses of the potential target anti-cancer  agents of high purity and may include parallel synthesis of selected analogs. This solicitation is anticipated to result in multiple awards.  The Offeror will prepare Material Safety Data Sheets for all single compounds and libraries which are delivered, and check the purities of compounds when requested.  

The contract type is a multiple award, work assignment, completion type contract for a period of four years with three one-year options.  The Government reserves the right to award new Contractors a two-year base contract with 5 one-year options.

The following mandatory qualification criteria will apply: 1) the Contractor cannot be a commercial pharmaceutical, chemical or biotechnology firm or their subsidiary since the assignments might include agents of a commercially confidential (discreet) nature; 2) as many of the compounds assigned for resynthesis may be of a hazardous nature, the Contractor will have the necessary licenses in place at the time of application, required by Local, State and Federal Governments to handle, synthesize, store and ship such compounds and dispose of toxic waste. 

This is a recompetition of the present contracts N02-CM-07116, N02-CM-07117, N02-CM07115 and N02-CM-07004.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Wing Inflatables, Inc., 1132 Somoa Blvd., Arcata, CA 95521, on a sole-source basis for 6 sets of Wing Sponsons, part number WG9300025 (11 meter split bow air-droppable tube).  The sponsons will be specifically incorporated into the 11 Meter Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat  (11M NSW RIB).  The 11M NSW RIB is a high-speed combatant craft used by the Special Boat Teams to support the Maritime Special Operations mission. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition because the government does not own the technical data package or specifications for the sponsons and the sponsons manufactured by Wings Inflatable are the only sponsons that have been tested, certified, and approved by the US Navy for use on the RIBs.  Firms desiring to have their product certified for future requirements must contact Mark Brinkerhoff at Mark.Brinkerhoff@navsoc.!  navy.mil, phone 619-437-0840.  The certification process would take between 12 and 18 months and would require the contractor to provide approximately 5 complete sets of sponsons, at no charge to the Government, for testing.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to place a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-04-G-0016 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company. The delivery order will be for the upgrading of spares, such as DC power supplies, RF/LF switches and power switches, DMMs and frequency time interval counters, to the current Boeing RTCASS configuration. The Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS), an avionics test set, developed to support the MV-22, CV-22, F/A-18A-D, EA-6B and AV-8B platforms, both deployed and ashore. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture has a requirement for Disclosure Methodology Consultant Services per the following Statement of Work.

1.0 BACKGROUND:

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) requires technical services to provide  network/minimum cost flow disclosure limitation methodology and the associated network/minimum cost flow disclosure FORTRAN programs.   These services are required for the development of this methodology and these programs at the agency and their application to the census of agriculture and its follow-on programs.  The NASS Datalab performs special tabulations upon request from data users and this methodology must be applied to these products as well.  These technical services are required so that the agency can meet the confidentiality requirements mandated by U.S. Code, Title 7.  These technical services must be completed in accordance with the Agency’s time schedules for the census of agriculture and its follow-on surveys.  Datalab services must be completed in a manner to ensure prompt customer service.  The period of performance for these services is April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007.
	
2.0 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

2.1 Technical Expertise and Guidance

2.10.  Provide technical guidance during the conversion of the entire FORTRAN disclosure analysis system and its associated programs into the SAS program language.

2.11.  Provide technical guidance including assistance with file creation and parameter settings during the first application of the SAS disclosure analysis system for the Census of Aquaculture.

2.12.  Provide technical guidance for the initial file creation and parameter settings for the SAS disclosure analysis system for the 2007 Census of Agriculture.

2.13  Provide technical expertise for defining and developing methodology and programs for disclosure limitation for special tabulations performed by the NASS Datalab.

2.2 Methodology Development, Implementation, and Validation

2.20.  Work with other Agency professionals to throughly test the SAS disclosure analysis system to ensure that the results are identical to the FORTRAN system.

 
2.21.   Work with Agency professionals to run the parallel test of the SAS and FORTRAN disclosure analysis system on the Census of Aquaculture.

2.22.  Develop a generalized framework for disclosure analysis methodology for the special tabulations performed by the NASS Datalab.

2.23.  Review the disclosure analysis methodology for congressional districts and related products to determine if a simpler methodology can be developed that adequately protects the data.  

2.24.  If the review indicates that a simpler methodology is acceptable, then, working with Agency professionals, fully develop, program and test this methodology. 

2.3 Technical Liaison

2.30  Work with other Agency professionals to thoroughly document the network/minimum cost flow disclosure methodology for the census of agriculture and follow-on Surveys.

2.31.  Work with Agency professionals to thoroughly document this generalized disclosure analysis framework for the NASS Datalab including descriptions on file creation and parameter settings.

2.32.  Conduct workshops at the USDA Facility located in Washington, D.C. to transfer knowledge to Agency professionals to ensure NASS staff can execute disclosure systems and that adequate backups are trained.

Task 4

Provide technical guidance through onsite consultation for the file creation and parameter settings for the SAS disclosure analysis system for the 2007 Census of Agriculture. (September 29, 2006)

Task 5

By surveying the scope of the various datalab requests, develop a disclosure analysis methodology and corresponding software specifications for a single generalized SAS disclosure system that will process the vast majority of these requests.  (March 30, 2007)

Task 6

(a)	Conduct research to determine if a less complex methodology for congressional district disclosure analysis can be developed. (November 30, 2006)

(b)	If the work in (a) indicates that a better methodology exists; then, fully develop, program, test and document the new methodology. (March 30, 2007)

Task 7

 
Currently there are several documents pertaining to disclosure theory, various applications, implementation, flowcharts, etc.  Develop a Microsoft Word document that merges all of the information contained in the various documents into one document.  (March 30, 2007)

Task 8

Conduct meetings and training sessions to train agency staff whose work involves census summarization and disclosure.  No special equipment of additional support would be required from the agency.  (Quarterly)

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Oregon is requesting quotes for appraisals of agricultural land located in Lane, Linn, and Marion Counties of Real Property for the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP). 

The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value, as defined below, of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised.  What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest. 

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement.  The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered by the WRP Warranty Easement Deed, the after value.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research of North Carolina to provide regular updates to a software system that identifies physicians located in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) who are eligible for HPSA bonus payments.
                                  
Section 413(a) and 413(b) of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 require revisions to the current HPSA bonus process.  Currently, Medicare carriers pay the HPSA bonus based on the inclusion of a modifier with the service when it is billed.  Designations of the HPSA bonus areas are based on determinations of primary care and mental health rural and urban whole and part county geographic HPSAs made by The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  These designations may be by county, census tract, township, etc.  Based on the legislation, that policy will be revised to no longer require the modifier for services rendered in zip code areas that fully fall within a designated HPSA area or are classified as dominant according to the United States Postal Service (USPS).  Services provided in areas that are eligible for the bonus, but do not fully fall within a HPSA bonus area must still be submitted with the modifier.  In order to pay the physician bonus The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide to the Medicare carriers and standard systems lists of the zip codes for which the bonuses may be paid.  Under an existing contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research developed a product to identify zip codes for which physicians will automatically be eligible for bonus payments.

                                        
CMS intends to issue a sole source contract for the continued support of this system.  Under this contract, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research will be required to provide regular updates to the product that can easily be utilized by the Medicare standard systems and carriers and also be added to the CMS website, as well as develop a process to test the zip code files to verify that the zip codes are correctly linked to the geographic areas.  It is imperative that CMS have a contractor that has total knowledge of the development of HPSAs as well as the geography of both HPSAs and zip code areas, experience with the relational file structure of the HPSA designations and corresponding Geographic Information System (GIS) files, how each is defined, and how each changes over time.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 1 year with 4 option years.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence.  The Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Request for Quotes; RFQ6025.  This RFQ is not a small business set aside. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325998 and the small-business size is 500.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is soliciting quotations from offerors to acquire suitable Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to be use in tissue culture for the production and evaluation of numerous viruses.  The objective is to ensure that viral vaccine candidates produce in tissue culture containing FBS are safe for the eventual administration to humans.  The contractor shall provide a lot of four hundred (250) bottles of five hundred (500) ml each of traceable United State origin serum to be close system collected at least three times 0.1um filtered and then pooled prior to bottling.  It must be non-irradiated and non-heat treated, bacterial, fungal and mycoplasma contamination must be below 15mg/dl and it must be bovine virus panel tested negative.  Two (2) or more lots must be available for testing in the labs assays for selection of a good lot.  If initial tested lots do not prove to be adequate for the labs assay and growth requirements, additional 250 bottles of FBS.  FBS is both a critical and widely variable component, which is added to media for supporting the growth of cells and viruses in the laboratory.  Due to variations in the source, collection and processing FBS lots vary widely within companies and between companies.  That means each lot must be tested individually to check for the necessary characteristics for the laboratory requirements.  It is critical that a large amount of serum is purchased from a single lot to maintain the reproducibility of research experiments and avoid variations caused by variability between lots.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Item; FAR 52.212.3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  The Government intends to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with California Institute for Mental Health, Sacramento , CA.

Purpose:

For many years, the treatment of behavioral health (i.e. mental and substance use conditions) has been a relatively neglected issue in public policy for most if not all western nations. Services for people with mental illness or substance abuse have suffered from under-funding, difficulties in workforce capacity and competency, lack of coordination and a history of discrimination and stigma amongst other factors.  At the same time there is increasing recognition of the significant impact on health, disability and morbidity associated with these conditions and their impacts on general health and health care costs, productivity, social capital and other indicators of societal well-being. 

Although guided by different financing systems and influenced by national politics and social traditions, many industrialized countries are now recognizing the problems that exist in their behavioral health sectors and are facing similar issues redesigning their health care systems and experimenting with innovative service solutions to address these concerns. New concepts, such as recovery and consumer activism, and an increasing mental illness as growing cause of disability, along with other factors drive these new agendas and create an unprecedented international momentum towards mental health systems reform.  

At the same time there are current initiatives to promote international exchange amongst behavioral health stakeholders who are positioned to lead systems change within their own countries.  These efforts are intended to promote a better understanding of the differences and similarities in national policy and create  opportunities for sharing these new visions  and comparing strategies for systems development and reform.  These exchanges hold much promise for all who might participate.  

Systems change of the magnitude proposed presents numerous challenges in leadership at all systems’ levels. A thorough evaluation of international trends and alternatives, building evidence in support of effective policies, and guiding the planning of future services has the potential to stimulate and expedite change in many countries. International comparisons might also promote the development of common indicators that countries could use to assess the performance of their behavioral health system.

The research agenda related to international mental health services and policy is limited. To date there have been few if any attempts to compare the analysis of current systems’ performance and the transformation plans adopted in different countries and highlight similarities and divergences in their themes, recommendations  and strategies The proposed project will provide CMHS and SAMHSA, as the leading agency in the transformation of the American behavioral health system, with a valuable perspective and has the potential to further inform policy, launch an important research agenda, and at the same time stimulate international collaborations with countries facing similar issues.
The California Institute for Mental Health (CIMH) was established in 1993 with a declared mission to "promote excellence in mental health services through training, technical assistance, research and policy development." It was the specific intent of the mental health directors who founded CIMH that CIMH would work collaboratively with all mental health system stakeholders. The commitment to collaboration has led the board to reorganize itself, expanding board membership to consumers, family members, and other interested persons representing the public interest.  CIMH is uniquely positioned with their affiliations with potential stakeholders including but not limited to the governmental agencies in Scotland, England, New Zealand, and Canada. CIMH is the only national organization to maintain these working relationships with demonstrated effectiveness in mental health policy, service exchange, and knowledge transfer abilities.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY

ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  The Court Registry Investment System (CRIS) is a cash management system for court registry funds developed and tested by the Clerk, hereinafter called “CRIS Fund Manager”, of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas (TX-S), which is located in Houston.  The system began operations in 1988.  Currently there are twenty-three participating courts around the country.  As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractor’s reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasury’s General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about March 27, 2006.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This procurement is restricted 8a competitive.  The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has a requirement, which will necessitate contractor support for services to support Government personnel in executing financial management responsibilities.  Contractor shall provide information management services that include analyzing customer requirements; developing reporting tools; providing access to information; reconciling information among multiple financial systems; and maintaining necessary support systems; and other non financial or administrative services as required by the Financial Management Office (FMO) to  meet Picatinny requirements.  Individual tasks will be defined using Performance Based Service Acquisition techniques.  Background:  The FMO plans, develops, analyzes and coordinates Research Development Testing and Evaluation (RDTE), Ammunition Procurement Army (APA), Operations Maintenance Army (OMA), and Military Construction Army (MCA) funds for planning, programming, budgeting  and execution for Picatinny and geographically remote sites.  FMOâ€™s primary activity is to determine, obtain and distribute program authority/financial resources required to accomplish mission efforts.  In addition, the FMO develops and monitors the execution of the ARDEC operating budget, including development of burden rates and financial analysis of financial statements and related reports. ARDEC uses a variety of computer-based applications to execute its mission.  Data processing capability enabling immediate access to current data and our financial applications is vitally important. The existing system is predominantly IBM-PC compatible, running M.S. Windows 2000, 2003 and Windows XP. The FMO data communications architecture is composed of the web servers connecting the individual desktop clients to a workgroup/departmental server, and through that server to the Picatinny web based intranet (PicaNET).  Additionally, some desktop users use their desktop clients to access and download financial data from SOMARDS DB2 based Army standard applications and financial databases. Data is analyzed and studied to present analytical financial management information to ARDECâ€™s senior staff. Microsoft Exchange provides mail capability.  Desktop client computers use the Microsoft Office Suite for common workplace automation tasks and customer support interaction.  FM uses the web based SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system enabling immediate access to current data and FMO financial applications. COGNOS Report Suite complements report tools and On Line Analytical Program tools for best use practices.  There are no plans to upgrade the infrastructure supporting this system at this time.  This system must be capable providing services to our customers within budget, on schedule, and with minimum disruption. Information processes and reports are required in daily transactional analysis. Financial information must remain available while changes are implemented to the system. Since other processing and reporting systems use as inputs the information provided by this system, care must be exercised that network and data interfaces are not inadvertently modified. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) five-year task order type contract is contemplated, and is anticipated to be awarded to the best overall value to the Government, cost and other factors  considered.  It should be noted that each offer shall be responsive in accordance with the informational requirements and evaluation criteria set forth in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).  RFP is expected to be posted on or about 4/3/06.  Contractor will be required to perform work on site at Picatinny Arsenal.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) has a requirement for a noncommercial engineering effort to train government personnel in the safe and proper ope ration of the Vigilante Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  This training shall include both ground-based classroom and simulation training in the proper operation of the Vehicle, as well as actual flight training time for each designated Government employee.   AATD intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis for award of a firm fixed price contract under the simplified acquisition threshold.  The effort is entitled,   Vigilante Ground and Flight Operations Tr aining. The sole source contractor is Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), 1710 SAIC Drive, McLean Virginia 22102-3703, an aircraft research and  development firm and the Vigilante Flight Software developer. The training shall include bo th ground-based classroom and simulation training in the proper operation of the Vehicle, as well as actual flight training time for each designated Government employee.  Training Government Personnel in the operation of the Vigilante VTOL UAV will improve  AATD's effectiveness in demonstrating various payload integration concepts on the Vigilante UAV testbed.  The Vigilante is AATD's testbed demonstrator for UAV technologies.  Using trained government personnel for vehicle operation will greatly reduce cost s and level of effort required to test various UAV technologies, both planned and unplanned, on this aircraft.  Based on our market research, SAIC, as the Vigilante Flight Software developer, is the only available source to provide Vigilante flight trainin g.  SAIC is the only source with the knowledge, data rights and experience to use the combination of hardware and software to instruct others how to fly the Vigilante.  The SAIC team is uniquely qualified based on its sole access to the proprietary Vigilan te technical design data software, simulator, flight vehicle and flight trained personnel to provide the Army with a Flight Training plan, classroom and simulator time, as well as actual flight training time.  It would not be economically viable to attempt  to acquire this training by other means.   The likelihood of an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  A solicitation document is not available.  The resultan t contract will consist of a two (2) month performance period.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this research and development effort is 541710. The size standard is 1500.  No options are anticipated for this program . While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal, which shall be considered. Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Sandra Schuck, 757-878-4819, Building 401, Lee Blvd, Ft  Eustis, VA 23604-5577).  Contracting Officer is Ms.Lauren Sebring.

<DESC>This modification provides for a change from the original synopsis to decrease the number of services required for this project and decrease the estimated maximum dollar value accordingly.  The small business size standard has also been corrected.  This modification provides additional clarifying language concerning the Mentor-Protégé Program and the Stafford Act.  The original synopsis is replaced with the following:  This procurement is set-aside for eligible Section 8(a) firms pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) §19.805, Competitive 8(a).   Potential offerors are encouraged to consider the Mentor/Protégé Program for this procurement and should contact their Business Development Specialist for assistance.  SBA’s mentor-protégé program allows an 8(a) firm to serve as the protégé and an experienced firm to serve as the mentor.  Candidate mentor firms may include large business prime contractors.  Under SBA’s mentor-protégé program, a mentor and protégé may joint venture (not merely team or have a prime contractor/subcontractor relationship) and be considered small for any federal procurement if the 8(a) firm meets the definition of small for the NAICS code assigned to the project.  Under the Mentor/Protégé Program, a Mentor/Protégé Agreement must be approved by the Small Business Administration (SBA) prior to the proposal due date.  Joint ventures must meet the requirements of 13 CFR §124.513 to compete for these 8(a) competitive procurements, and the Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract.  FAR clause 52.219-14 “Limitations on Subcontracting” applies to all 8(a) contracts and specifies that the 8(a) firm must perform a certain percentage of the work with its own resources.  The joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required and the 8(a) partner to the joint venture must perform a significant portion of the contract.  In joint ventures under the SBA’s mentor-protégé program, the contents of the joint venture are specified by SBA and the agreement must be fair and equitable.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The small business size standard is $32.5 million.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§5121 et seq.)(Stafford Act), to provide assistance to applicants of Presidentially-declared disasters and emergencies.  FEMA’s Individual Assistance (IA) Program provides temporary housing assistance to disaster applicants in accordance with the Act.  In order to accomplish its mission, FEMA requires nationwide Individual Assistance-Technical Assistance Contract (IA-TAC) services, to include but not limited to, the following tasks: (1)  Site Assessment for potential group sites related to placement of temporary housing; (2)  Site Inspections for potential placement of temporary housing on applicants property; (3)  Staging area support for temporary housing units; (4) Installation of temporary housing units; (5) Group site design for building and placement of temporary housing units; and (6) General construction services (e.g. temporary housing of disaster workers or applicants, refurbishment of existing housing units to make habitable).  The period of performance will be five years from date of award.  FEMA intends to award resulting Section 8(a) competitive, Performance Based, Fixed Unit Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), multiple award contracts.  FEMA anticipates that approximately four (4) contracts will be awarded.  The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $500,000,000 ($100 million per year).  Task orders issued (in response to a disaster) under any resulting contracts will be subject to Section 307 of the Stafford Act; this means that the successful contractors will utilize local firms to the maximum extent practical for subcontracting opportunities.  Conifteen (15) days following publication of this announcement.  Potential offerors that do not have the capability to download from FBO, may request, in writing, a copy of the solicitation, including any attachments or amendments.  Potential offerors making this request must include in their written request an adequate justification for not obtaining the solicitation via the Internet.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests may be made via e-mail addressed to nancy.costello@dhs.gov or faxed to Nancy Costello at 202-646-3239.  Offerors are cautioned to include Solicitation number HSFEHQ-06-R-0025 on all documentation submitted in response to this requirement.  A pre-proposal conference will held and due diligence will be conducted as specified in the solicitation.  Technical proposals and business proposals will be required approximately thirty (30) days following the RFP issue date.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation may be accessed at www.arnet.gov.

Do you desire your contractor's facility to be at or near China Lake?  A: It is not anticipated that there will be a full-time on-site presence required, however the Contractor may require access to intelligence data, including the SIPRNET at the government activity.

A: At this time the known minimum quantity is $50,000 and the anticipated maximum quantity is 75,700 hours, however the estimated number of task orders to be awarded per year is not known.

A brief description of the program follows:  DSCP intends to provide our customers with a viable commercial-based delivery program for laboratory supplies.  The purpose is to maintain an industry standard "Just-In-Time" (JIT) inventory approach for any or all laboratory ware/supplies.  The objective of the LIDS is to develop "Total Catalog/Total Delivered Price" ordering, payment and administration of lab ware and lab supplies.  The program will provide DoD customers total access to product in peacetime and mobilization, improve the industry's ability to provide nearly all products under one contracting arrangement and significantly improve industry's ability to respond quickly to a wide range and type of military mobilization and deployments.

As part of your response to the solicitation you will be required to submit a catalog which will be published on a DSCP System known as ECAT.  The catalog must reflect total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as total cost of item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  There will be two communication strategies available for ECAT, Web Supplier Interface or American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 EDI standards.  You will have to be capable of doing one or the other.  

This solicitation is considered a standing solicitation and will remain in effect unless replaced by an updated solicitation.  Closing date and time for receipt of proposals has been established as 3:00 PM/EST on the last business day of March, June, September and December.

<DESC>The objective of the AWDI Program is to develop, demonstrate and implement advanced Manufacturing processes and practices that markedly reduce cost and accelerate technology insertion associated with the transition of emerging weapon data link systems into munitions SDD/LRIP/FRP programs.   Focus will be toward the pursuit of aggressive product and process technologies that can dramatically lower WDL acquisition costs from their current baseline toward an ultimate production cost goal below $5000/datalink by FY13.  The primary transition target for this effort is Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB-II).  However, solution applicability to multiple systems is a premium and interim transition onto other Precision Guided Munition (PGM) systems (i.e. Joint Air to Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM)) prior to FY10 is also highly desirable.  A successful program will result in commitment to fully implement the developed processes and practices as well as a transition plan with System Program Office buy-in to incorporate the improved WDL product and processes onto their respective system(s).  The total period of performance for the basic effort is 44 months:  40 months for the technical effort and 4 months for completing the final report.  Reports are the primary deliverables on this contractual action.   Some prototype hardware may be developed as process test articles, deliverable to the Government at the end of contract.

Point of Contact: Glenn McCarthy, (718) 553-3085 Date Closed:  10MAR06 ________________________________________________________________________ Purpose This Screening Information Request (SIR) is for two separate projects, one at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Virginia, and one at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma, New York.  This Screening Information Request (SIR) is the first step in obtaining qualified potential offerors for award.  Contractors who qualify under this SIR will receive the Request for Offer.  Prospective offerors must fax a letter of interest and all pertinent information to Glenn Fox McCarthy at 718-995-5685, and indicate in their letter of interest which project they would like to be considered for.  The letter and qualifications must include information on at least three (3) projects within the last five (5) years, similar in size, scope and complexity.  The information shall state in a clear and concise manner all the specialized experience necessary to convey the offeror's understanding of, and capacity to accomplish, the required project.  The information shall be so clear and unambiguous as to negate the need for further explanation.  Screening decisions will be based on the evaluation criteria stated below on a pass/fail basis. The first five (5) offerers to be deemed qualified for each project, based on the evaluation criteria, will receive the Request for Offers (RFO).  Separate vendor lists will be created for each project.  Failure to provide all of the information requested shall eliminate the contractor from participation in the evaluation process and receiving the RFO. In addition, failure to meet the requirements of this announcement shall result in the downselection of the offeror, and the offeror will not receive a copy of the RFO.  All offerors who receive a passing score on the evaluation will then move on to the second level, and will be sent a copy of the RFO.  Those offerors will then submit a price, and the offeror submitting the lowest price will be awarded the contract. Project Description Scope - New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, Ronkonkoma, New York This project consists of renovations to architectural, mechanical and electrical systems, fire detection/suppression systems and hazardous materials abatement.  The estimated price range for this construction is $3,000,000 to $4,000,000.    The areas affected include offices, cafeteria, and basement.  The project covers an area of approximately 35,000 square feet.  Because the Air Route Traffic Control Center operates continuously some work will need to be done during nights and weekends to avoid interruption of facility operations. Scope - Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, Leesburg, Virginia This project consists of renovating architectural, mechanical and electrical systems, hazardous materials abatement and adding fire suppression & fire/smoke detection system in an area of approximately 33,000 square feet consisting mostly of office space, but also including a cafeteria, kitchen and other ancillary spaces.  The estimated price range for construction is between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000.  Because the Air Route Traffic Control Center operates continuously, the work is to be done in a phased approach.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Consumables for DNA Sequencing Using ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer Instruments
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-PB(HG)-2006-049-KLW
<RESPDATE>011306
<CONTACT>Kesha Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-2605, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email kw139c@nih.gov - Debra Hawkins, Chief, Procurement Branch, Phone (301) 435-0367, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email dh41g@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting a market survey to determine if there are commercial small businesses capable of providing support to the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) through the purchase of consumables for fluorescent DNA sequencing using ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer instruments.  The basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct molecular genetics research. The NIH Intramural DNA Sequencing program has developed and released capillary-based sequencing instruments that employ automated stackers for continuous loading of plates. These highly sensitive instruments are revolutionizing large-scale DNA sequencing. After careful and systematic investigation, NIH has made a major commitment to utilize the instrument recently released by Applied Biosystems, called the ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer. To date, a purchase of twelve ABI 3730 instruments has been made and the instruments are being used on a 24 hour basis in production.

The purchase of a standard suite of consumables that are required for use on the ABI 3730 instruments to perform DNA sequencing can be broadly divided into four major categories: 

(1) Capillary arrays (the small, thread-like pieces of glass-like material into which the matrix and DNA samples are injected for separation)

(2) Separation matrix (the material injected into the capillaries for separating DNA fragments; called ‘POP’ matrix by Applied Biosystems)

(3) Running buffer (a specially formulated salt solution for performing DNA electrophoresis)

(4) Fluorescent sequencing reaction mixes (BigDye Terminators)

Based on the anticipated DNA sequencing program at NISC, large amounts of each of these four classes of consumables will be required. This requirement is intended to allow NISC the ability to purchase sufficient quantities of the above consumables for using their set of ABI 3730 instruments to meet their DNA sequencing production goals. Note that the above four classes of consumables capture the general range of materials required for using the ABI 3730 instrument for large-scale DNA sequencing. Because the instrument is so new and because the technology of fluorescent-based DNA sequencing is constantly evolving, improved consumables are routinely introduced by Applied Biosystems. Similarly, reformations and variant forms of these consumables, in particular the fluorescent sequencing reactions, are frequently introduced by Applied Biosystems. The intent is to provide NISC the ability to purchase sufficient quantities of consumables required for using their ABI 3730 instruments, including their ability to quickly change the precise consumables purchased when new substitutes or alternatives are offered. 
	
The estimated number of consumables to be supplied are as follows: 1) #4337458 BigDye Terminator Kits (10 each); 2) #4336357 POP 7 Reagent (12 each); 3) #4316357 POP 6 Reagent (20 each); 4) #4316355 POP 4 Reagent (50 each); 5) #4319899 Array for 3100 (10 each); 6) #402824 Running Buffer for 3100 (90 each); and 7) #4335611 POP 7 Reagent (30 each).   All of these consumables are tailored for use on ABI PRISM 3730XL instruments, in most cases with Applied Biosystems owning the patent rights.  Use of the listed consumables must result in the ability to generate high-fidelity sequence data (<1% ambiguous bases over 800 pb reads) using the ABI 3730 instrument.  Sequencing reagents must be capable of using cycle-sequencing protocols with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios starting with minimal amounts (e.g. <100 ng) of starting DNA.  Consumables must be tailored for use on ABI 3730 instruments for performing DNA sequencing.  They must not compromise the warranty or service contract of these instruments.  Additionally, the primer cycle sequencing ready reaction kit must be a single energy transfer molecule using a donor fluorescein and an acceptor dichlororhodamine coupled by a highly efficient energy transfer linker to give the brightest signal for the longest read lengths.   This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and one is not currently available.  All interested small businesses, 8(a), Hubzone or disabled veterans are requested to submit capability statements demonstrating their ability to provide the required quantity of consumable items.  The NIH intends to negotiate a one (1) year contract with four (4) subsequent one (1) year options. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 325414.

The capability statements must be submitted not later than January 13, 2006 and must reference number NHLBI-PB(HG)-2006-049/KLW. Four (4) copies of your capability statements should be delivered to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Room 6137, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attn.: Kesha L.

<CONTACT>Paula Frickey, NOAA Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-4791, Fax 301-427-2164, Email paula.frickey@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) intends to extend an existing sole-source contract with Harris Corporation effective May 1, 2006, through April 30, 2007, for a period of 12 months due to significant resource issues at the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) from November 2004 to the present time.  However, it is the government’s intent to conduct a competition after this bridge contract.  The purpose of this contract is to provide Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) support for the DOC/NOAA/NESDIS/NPOESS program.  Further, the Government requires an enduring and survivable capability to provide the United States military with accurate worldwide weather information. This capability is provided by the DMSP, which collects and disseminates global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  The DoD also needs a capability to collect and disseminate other specialized meteorological, terrestrial, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical data to users.  Users require these services through all levels of conflict in which they are capable of surviving.  DMSP consists of a space segment, link segment, ground segment, and user segment.  
Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit: two are designated primary, two are secondary, one is partially operational, and one is reserved for testing only.  The DMSP mission is expected to continue until 2019.  
The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.


GROUND SEGMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Support for the ground system will include hardware and software component supply, repair, test, maintenance, upgrade, and technical support.  System upgrades, which include new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) components, shall be integrated into existing legacy systems in such a manner as to ensure requirements for timely and enduring data delivery are met.   Current software/OS consist of:  Open VMS, Windows NT/2000, Unix, Oracle, MS SQL, PVWAVE, EPOCH, and What’s Up Gold.  Programming languages consist of Fortran, C++, Ada, and PERL.  Network protocols consist of TCP/IP and DECNET.  

The Command Control and Communication (C3) system uses COTS and custom built hardware and software to provide satellite S-Band (2207.5—2252.5 MHz) command up-link and data down-link capability.  This includes equipment such as the Telemetry and Command System (TCS), Dual Decommutator and Command processor (DDCP), System Communications Unit (SCU), ARTS Interface Unit (AIU), Aiken Switch, and Data Quality Monitor (DQM).  The TCS is a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) platform running custom code that maintains satellite telemetry and command databases, generates satellite loads and commands, archives data and logs for engineering analysis, provides information for display on operations consoles and controls overall ground system function.    The DDCP is a custom designed device that provides decommutation and time-tagging of DMSP real-time and stored payload telemetry and outputs data via TCP/IP to the TCS via custom developed code.  It performs DMSP satellite command and load formatting, authentication, and echo check verification as well as provides KG control. Command and control, telemetry, and mission data up-link and down-link flows through cryptographic processors including KG-61 and KG-144.  The SCU is a custom designed device that provides point-to-point and broadcast inter-site communications via a TDM scheme and specialized formatting to ensure the reliable delivery of DMSP mission, telemetry, and commanding data between DMSP ground locations. The AIU is a modified, commercially available command processor that provides a direct interface with AFSCN tracking sites.  The Aiken Switch is a 20+ year old legacy component that provides switching and routing of DMSP DOMSAT links, SCUs, and TCS strings.  The input and output of all DMSP commanding and telemetry routes through and is controlled by the Aiken Switch.  DQM is a Windows XP based custom coded tool that allows users and operators to monitor data quality as it is down-linked.  DQM will provide the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) with a robust switching capability for multiple DOMSAT streams for its ingest processors.  The DMSP ground system network provides interconnectivity between all sites, users, and operations centers with TCP/IP based communications systems, DOMSAT links (3.2256 Mbps), and T1 connections.  The network is presently divided into three subsystems:  Communications, Switching, and Processing.  Many network components are integrated into more then one subsystem.  DMSP C3 support shall include in-depth comprehension of the DMSP C3 system, from operator interface to satellite command, control, and data recovery through to data receipt, quality monitoring, and ingest at AFWA and FNMOC.  DMSP C3 support will also include sustainment engineering for mission unique software, independent test analyses and problem isolation.  

The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment shall be less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions shall not exceed 3 hours.  AFWA and FNMOC shall receive 100% of global smooth data within 10 minutes of downlink, and 100% of find data within 4 hours of downlink.  


SERVICES INFORMATION:

Required services will include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP will need supply storage at a Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor shall furnish all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program will require on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications will be needed.  Modifications will include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment will include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland MD.  Interaction with government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system will be required.  In addition, the contractor shall be able to send and receive equipment to CONUS and international locations, work with foreign governments and contractors to track, inventory, and/or transfer custody of equipment.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Services will include part-time availability of a knowledgeable engineer with access to Schriever AFB, CO, and a full-time engineer in Suitland, MD.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  DMSP requires investigating new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies, and then testing and integrating these new acquisitions into the current system.  The Contractor will be expected to develop a long term system engineering and sustainment plan for DMSP C3 and provide the government with recommendations and milestones to sustain the ground network.  All hardware and software upgrades will meet the Department of Commerce’s Information Technology security requirements.   

Steps are near completion to begin replacement of the System Communications Units (SCUs) within the DMSP ground system.  These steps included tasks needed to identify, test, and demonstrate potential commercial equipment that can enable NOAA to potentially transform its data handling of DMSP bit stream data to an IP switched packet network.  It also included the associated design work to integrate the selected replacement device into the ground system with the least possible impact.  Work to procure, install, integrate and test the SCU replacement devices within the ground system will need to be started during this effort.

All responses, which must have substantial documentation that addresses the requirements in this announcement in order for the Government to determine if your company is able to do the work required, must be received within 45 calendar days for the posted date of this Notice of Intent and addressed to Paula Frickey, POC, Phone 301-713-4791, Fax 301 427-2164, Email Paula.Frickey@noaa.gov.  This is an on-going effort and no down time will be acceptable for any of the segments.

<DESC>This is a request for information purposes only.  AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, and as such any request for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking sources capable of providing services to implement a centralized, online system for the management of Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) pledges and their distribution and to provide customer support to Federal employee donors. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilities, it is suggested that your package be sent by commercial delivery service.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to ask interested business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements to evaluate the feasibility of maintaining an online workplace donation system designed to promote electronic CFC donations from Federal donors, provide those donors with central access to all CFC participating charities, and eliminate current CFC geographic restrictions to donating only to national and local charities eligible in the donor’s local campaign.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this notice, however, a separate synopsis will be released prior to any such solicitation.  

Potential contractors should provide information concerning: (1)  software applications and support services for assigning unique identification codes for the estimated 15,000+  participating CFC charities; (2) software applications and support services to maintain a National CFC Charity Registry/Database and profile of all CFC charities; (3) software applications and support services that will allow over 1 million potential users to access the system during peak hours and to pledge electronically to charities located outside of the campaign corresponding to their official duty station; (4) software applications and support services that allow interface with local campaign fiscal agents (Principal Combined Federal Organizations (PCFOs)), Federal payroll offices and CFC charities; (5)  telephone-based voice recognition system for employees without internet access; (6) software applications and fiscal management services to support accountability on multiple levels (i.e. between contractor and donors, contractor and charities and contractor and PCFOs, and contractor and OPM); and, (7) information as to how a proposed contractor would respond to CFC regulatory and reporting compliance issues. 
Potential contractors would not be required to provide both the software and operations support, but must have the infrastructure and capacity to manage the entire system.   

The CFC program allows contributions from September 1 to December 15 of each year, therefore the software requirements for receiving on-line pledges is cyclical.  It is anticipated that information about the participating charities could be accessed year-round.  The overall system must comply with the regulatory requirements of the CFC found at www.opm.gov/cfc.  
 
OPM requests business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements that include a description of the organization’s ability to meet the above requirements.  It is important that submitted capability statements include complete information addressing each of the above information requirements and should include:  estimated price for development and implementation (including pricing per transaction), and estimated product development cycle for implementation.  Interested businesses should also submit information concerning the size, type, structure, and governance of the organization, and information and regarding experience with similar programs.  Capability statements will be reviewed to determine capacity to handle the scope of services required and pricing alternatives.  Responses to this synopsis must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. on April 3, 2006.  Please submit two copies of your response to: Sharon Phillips, Contracting Officer, Contracting Group, MS-CCFAS, U.S Office of Personnel Management, Room 1342, 1900 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20415. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilitis, it is suggested that your package be sent by a commercial delivery service.

<SUBJECT>68 -- Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Chemical and Allied Products
<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Chemical and Allied Products. 
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Ammonia (except fertilizer material) merchant wholesalers; Chemical gases merchant wholesalers; Chemicals (except agriculture); Compressed gases (except LP gas) merchant wholesalers; Dry ice merchant wholesalers; Gases, compressed and liquefied (except liquefied petroleum gas), merchant wholesaler; Ice, dry, merchant wholesalers; Industrial chemicals merchant wholesalers; Liquefied gases (except LP) merchant wholesalers; Organic chemicals merchant wholesalers; and Welding gases merchant wholesalers.
 According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply this class of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
 

DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.§ 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR §121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
 

     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR §121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on a six digit coding system. The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Ammonia (except fertilizer material) merchant wholesalers; Chemical gases merchant wholesalers; Chemicals (except agriculture); Compressed gases (except LP gas) merchant wholesalers; Dry ice merchant wholesalers; Gases, compressed and liquefied (except liquefied petroleum gas), merchant wholesaler; Ice, dry, merchant wholesalers; Industrial chemicals merchant wholesalers; Liquefied gases (except LP) merchant wholesalers; Organic chemicals merchant wholesalers; and Welding gases merchant wholesalers
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 424690.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICAITON IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].

<DESC>Special Notice 06-20:  PREventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) Teaming and Information Session DATE: March 27, 2006, REGISTRATION DEADLINE: March 17, 2006, TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4974, URL: www.preventblast.com



PREVENT Teaming and Information Session, SN06-20.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a teaming and information session for PREVENT, a potential new DARPA program.  This potential program would explore innovative research into the causes of traumatic brain injury resulting from exposure to explosions.  Traumatic brain injuries are especially prevalent among soldiers that have been exposed to improvised explosive devices, in some cases absent of any other injury.  Traditional methods of correlating the overpressure “blast” wave to injury fail to explain this result.  DARPA/DSO recognizes that mitigating, preventing, and treating these injuries is of vital importance to soldier health.  Of particular interest to this program are complete analyses of all the physical forces released by an explosion and correlated to biologically relevant models of injury, from the cell to the whole body model.  Innovative and revolutionary research that is multi-disciplinary and led by a strong systems integrator is strongly encouraged.    

The teaming and information session will be held at the Westin Arlington Gateway, 801 Glebe Rd., Arlington, VA, on March 27, 2006.  The goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the PREVENT program vision and goals; and (b) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential research organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the PREVENT program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the teaming and information session participants.  Additionally, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.preventblast.com. 

Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to an anticipated DARPA PREVENT solicitation.  Teaming and information session participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session.  Posters must be submitted by March 17, 2006, at 4 P.M. ET.  A maximum of 100 4ft. by 4 ft. posters can be accommodated.  Teaming and information session details (including registration information and poster submissions) are given on the PREVENT website at http://www.preventblast.com. 

There is no fee for any teaming and information session activities.  Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 attendees) and early registration is strongly recommended.  The registration cutoff date is March 17, 2006, at noon ET, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.    Further administrative information is available from Michelle Mann (mannm@sainc.com).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Geoffrey Ling (gling@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the “PREVENT Teaming and Information Session” in correspondence.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The solicitation document is available at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa06-24.html.  

Material presented at the teaming and information session, including posters presented at the poster session, DARPA presentations, and any DARPA response to clarification inquiries, will also be available at http://www.preventblast.com for those interested in BAA06-24 but unable to attend.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [U S EPA] Environmental Sciences Division [ESD] intends to award a fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR] Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items and FAR 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition  The purpose of this research is to use novel methods incorporating SSURGO soils and NLCD land cover to map the existence of tile drains in the state of Illinois. Information is needed on the spatial co-occurrence of riparian vegetation and tile drainage systems because tile drains obviate the nutrient filtering capability of riparian vegetation. The tasks required to accomplish project objectives are listed below.  All work shall be completed within 
Tasks
A.) In collaboration with EP A, develop two-class soil maps for counties in east-central Illinois where SSURGO data are available. The two classes will be: 1) soils where tile drainage is likely and 2) soils were tile drainage is not likely. The two-class maps will be developed through conflation ofNLCD land cover and SSURGO soils. The two-class soil map will then be conflated with the NHD to identified stream segments where tile drain outlets are likely and streams segments where tile drain outlets are not likely.
B.) In collaboration with EP A, develop as sampling strategy to sample the two-class maps developed under Task A. The sampling strategy should stratify by the map classes identified in Task A and include adequate geographic dispersion so that samples are included from the following counties: La Salle, Grundy, Kankakee, Marshall, Livingston, Ford, Iroquois, Tazewell, McLean, Logan, De Witt, Piatt, Champaign, Vermillion, Sangamon, Macon, Moultrie, Douglas, Edgar, Christian, Shelby, Cumberland, Clark, Fayette, Effingham, Jasper, Crawford, Carrol, Adams, and Alexander. The sampling strategy should account for access issues.
c.) Conduct site visits for the locations selected under task B. The purpose of the field visits will be to confirm the existence (or lack thereof) of tile drainage systems. Results will be compiled in a spreadsheet that identifies the geographic location of the site, the map class identified in Task A, county, and the existence (or lack thereof) of tile drainage systems.
EP A personnel will participate in the field campaign to the extent practicable.
D.) A brief report that documents methods and sampling results (including spreadsheet). The report and sampling results should be delivered in paper and electronic format, using, Microsoft word and excel.
Project completion time will be 6 months after receipt of order.
2. Technical Evaluation Criteria
A.) Technical Approach
The successful applicant will be able to demonstrate: 1) detailed knowledge of agricultural practices in east-central Illinois; 2) detailed knowledge of SSURGO soil mapping in east-central Illinois; 3) detailed knowledge of the interactions between agriculture and wetland soils that lead to the use of tile drainage systems in east-central 
Illinois; 4) novel ways to overcome access issues during site visits, and; 5) adequate staffing to conduct Tack C (field campaign).
Items 1 through 3 above will be evaluated based on: I) papers published in the peer-reviewed literature, and; 2) submitted curriculum vitas. Item 4 will be evaluated by a brief (e.g., one-page) written response submitted by the applicant on possible ways to overcome access issues during the field campaign. Item 5 will be evaluated based on the staffing roster proposed by the applicant. The roster should include curriculum vitas.
B.) Qualifications of Personnel
The successful applicant shall describe specific, relevant experience, and availability of personnel needed to provide services similar in scope to those described in the Statement of Work. The successful applicant will be able to demonstrate a well-developed research record in the subject areas of agriculture and agricultural use of subsurface drainage in east-central Illinois, water quality modeling as it relates to subsurface drainage in Illinois, and soils mapping and GIS.
C.) Past Performance
Demonstrated successful past performance of the successful applicant and any major subcontractors as evidenced by information gathered concerning the identified list of contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three (3) years and those currently in process for similar work. The successful applicant shall include client names, addresses, telephone numbers, contact persons, and nature of work performed.
D.) Price
Price is equal in importance to the technical evaluation criteria.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE [RFQ] IS AVAILABLE.  Vendor must provide Federal Tax Identification Number, Dun and Bradstreet Number, and Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for award.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690.  Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA’s requirement as stated herein may submit a response which, if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

Description:  412 TW has a requirement to sustain and replace aging network media distribution equipment utilized to distribute test data into Mission Control Room Areas.  Existing distribution of mission critical Time Space Position Information (TSPI) data for display on Test Evaluation Command and Control System (TECCS) display clients located in RMCC Mission Control Rooms and support areas is performed using dozens of standalone media converters, each with an individual power source.  Consolidation of these media converters into multiple unit media centers is needed to centralize data distribution, increase available network bandwidth, simplify power and fiber/copper distribution, patching and circuit problem isolation. 

The media converters being utilized at this time are manufactured by Versitron.  These media converters hold cards specifically made for the media racks (Versitron part numbers MCC-16R and M7273S).  No other manufacturer’s cards will fit into the racks.  

Market research was conducted reviewing product literature published by manufactures, distributors, and dealers available on the internet.  Information was also gathered through communication with industry and government personnel.  No other known manufacturer’s band was found that could meet the specifications needed for this requirement.  It was found Versitron does have distributors that sell the media converter

Place of delivery, performance, and acceptance is FOB Destination to Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

•	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

•	If editing is required, update the first submission; don’t create a second invoice submission.

•	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

•	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don’t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

•	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

•	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. “R” to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

•	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

•	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month’s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

(ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Description:  412 TW has a requirement to sustain and replace aging network media distribution equipment utilized to distribute test data into Mission Control Room Areas.  Existing distribution of mission critical Time Space Position Information (TSPI) data for display on Test Evaluation Command and Control System (TECCS) display clients located in RMCC Mission Control Rooms and support areas is performed using dozens of standalone media converters, each with an individual power source.  Consolidation of these media converters into multiple unit media centers is needed to centralize data distribution, increase available network bandwidth, simplify power and fiber/copper distribution, patching and circuit problem isolation. 

The media converters being utilized at this time are manufactured by Versitron.  These media converters hold cards specifically made for the media racks (Versitron part numbers MCC-16R and M7273S).  No other manufacturer’s cards will fit into the racks.  

Market research was conducted reviewing product literature published by manufactures, distributors, and dealers available on the internet.  Information was also gathered through communication with industry and government personnel.  No other known manufacturer’s band was found that could meet the specifications needed for this requirement.  It was found Versitron does have distributors that sell the media converter

Please list any references you might know regarding the contractor's performance:
5.  Block #11 has missing instruction on all previous SF30s.  SF30 for amendment 08 can be used to identify the instructions in all previous SF30’s issued.

6.  Responses to questions received are as follows:

6.1  Who is the incumbent?  Has their performance been satisfactory?

Response:  The incumbent is Computer Packages, Inc.   I can not release information on another contractor's performance.

6.2  How much of the work has to be done on site?

Response: The work is not performed at our site.  

6.3  Are there sample reports available for those that are required?  Are there
other sample reports that may be desired?  Do all reports have to be in
paper - or can queries be provided via a secure web site?

 Response:  No sample reports.  The fedbizopps posting identified all our required
reports.  Offerors must tell us how they will provide reports. 

6.4  What is the present form of the database of patents?  Who has been updating
it?  Is it certified as accurate?

 Response:  The contractor responsible for maintaining the database.  The database file is in “Word” format.

6.5  What is the format of the docket from the lawyers?

 Response:  The docket from our lawyers is in WORD format.

6.6  The quality form indicates "client complaints".  Who is the client?

 Response:  The client is the COR, our attorneys, could be scientists.  
  
6.7  Does contract expect the contractor to prepay any fees with follow on
reimbursements?  If so, is there an interest fee calculated if the payments
from the government are not timely?

 Response:  Yes.  For interest, see FAR Part 32.614-32.616 and clause 52.232-17.  According to The Federal Contracts Report the US Treasury Dept is allowed under the  Prompt Payment Act and Contract Disputes Act a 4.5 interest rate for the reporting period ending in December 2005.

6.8  Are the fees associated with the wire transfers recoverable?  Or are they
expected to be included in the price quoted?

 Response:  Your question is not clear.  The payment of annuities and taxes are paid
out of the NTE line item.  All other cost must be included in the other line
items.

6.9  There would be 2 receipts: one for the wire transfer; one from the foreign
PTO for the fee. We'd need to handle both.  Is that correct?

 Response:  Yes, contractor handles all receipts.





6.10  Who is responsible for currency exchange, and potential currency exchange
losses?

Response:  The contractor is responsible.   

6.11	I would like some clarification on the NTE amounts do these represent the amount of annuity fees to be paid by the contractor initially and reimbursed by the government?

Response:  The NTEA is to cover the cost of annuity payments and taxes.  It is what the government is estimating those costs to be.  The Contractor will make the payments and will be reimbursed by the government for actual cost incurred for that line item.
   
6.12	Can you identify any of the case numbers for the foreign cases to be renewed?

Response:  The case load is identified under "estimated quantity".  Please clarify you question.  If you are asking for case numbers to foreign patents currently being processed, please provide an explanation as to how this information will assist in developing your offer.  I do not currently have that information.  
   
6.13  This is a full and open competition with a size standard of $6 Million. Does this mean you have
to be a business doing about $6 Million worth of sales each year?

Response:  The size standard was changed in amendment 6 to $6.5.  This means the firm's earnings can not exceed $6.5 million dollars over a three year period.  The NAICS Code website should have a telephone number for contractors to call for assistance.  

6.14	We were asking for an extension of the due date.

Response:  There will be no extension to the proposal due date.  Offerors were given 37 days to submit offers.  The FAR requires only 30 days.

6.15  What is the present form of the database of patents?  The information about
the patents and payments are presently in some kind of electronic format.
What is it?  

Response:  The database or electronic format is in “Word”.

6.16  Form 1449:  On items 23 and 24,  are you asking for cost per case(Unit
price) and total cost ( Amount) =  cost per case X estimated number of
cases ?

Response:  You do not have to put anything in block 23 of the SF1449. That information goes in Section IA Price Schedule.  Item 24 is self explanatory.  It is the total cost for each period identified in block 20.

6.17  Item 27a.  Refers to attached documents.  Are these the SF 30 forms?

 Response:  Item 27a on the SF1449 refers to the clauses in the RFP which was posted in amendments 2 and 5 of  the combined synopsis and solicitation.  The full text of the clause can be found by accessing the FAR website, which is referenced in the solicitation posted.









6.18  SF 30 forms:  Looks like part of item 11 is cut off on all forms.    Also,
which items need to be filled out by us on these forms?

Response:  Offerors can use the SF30 for amendment 8 to view the instructions noted in block 11.  Just follow the instructions on the SF30 that apply to the “Contractor”. 

SF30 for amendment 09 is not up loadable.  Send an email to request copies of the SF30 which requires the return of one (1) signed copy with the offer.  Copies will be emailed to you once your email address is received.

All other terms and conditions remains unchanged.

<DESC>Purpose of this modification to the solicitation is to provide the following information: 1. Will MEDCOM provide an automated invoice file (preferably in ASCII text format) in addition to providing lists of vendors and their addresses with contact points? Also, will MEDCOM provide lists of credits established against vendors as an audit analysi s tool to assure that auditors do not pursue credits already entered on government records?  We do not have a consolidated procurement system therefore we can not provide an automated invoice file that a contractor can run their proprietary software system  against.  We will provide an EXCEL sheet of the names of all the vendors we have done business with and a list of all our activities.   It will be up to the winning contractor to contact the companies to determine if they have any open accounts payables o wed to an Army activity.  2. What is the MEDCOM procedure to allow the contractor to be reimbursed for offsets? The solicitation references the fact that they will pay based on credits turned in by vendors.  Offsetting credits was not considered a part of the soliticaiation.
