<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for repair services for Power Supply Modulators (PSM), P/N 1764, NSN 6130-01-525-9960 with an estimated annual quantity of 20 per year. The requirement includes a base period and option provisions to renew for four additional 1-year periods. The National Airway Systems Engineering Group (ATO-W) modified the original Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3) to incorporate the PSM as part of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) in June 2005.  This equipment monitors Airport Surface operations (Ground Movements of Aircraft) and provides an effective means of directing and moving surface traffic.  The PSM contains high-powered pulse traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which replaced the grid modulators and inverter assemblies with each of the two transmitter channels.  These repair services are only known to be available from Quarterwave Corporation, Rohnert Park, CA, because they hold the proprietary data rights and repair specifications for this item.  The government does not have the test capability, evaluation criteria, or technical documentation available to allow other sources to repair these items.  To receive consideration as a potential repair source, any other interested party must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans, part lists, and proof of rights to use the data.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.   Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.   Vendors must respond directly to the contract specialist identified.  Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements and have access to OEM data called out in this market survey must respond with their documentation in writing to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center Attn: AMQ-210/Brandon Iven P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK  73125 Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey File AC-07-58650, to arrive by October 11, 2007.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<DESC>USAID/Uganda intends to award a one year contract to JSI Research and Training Institute, Inc. (JSI), 44 Farnsworth Street, Boston, MA 02210-1211 under the authority of FAR 6.302 and as supplemented by AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.

JSI has served as a key USAID implementing partner supporting PEPFAR as well as the Government of Uganda (GOU) in meeting national HIV counseling and testing (HCT) and palliative care (PC) targets since 2002.  For the past five years, JSI has done this through direct support to the local governments and civil society organizations in the districts they support as well as through subawards to national NGOs.  JSI and its partners has contributed 40% of USG PEPFAR HCT targets and at least 25% of palliative care targets since 2003.

USAID has the need for a new mechanism that grants USAID more direct control of the implementation process to help USAID/Uganda achieve targets approved in the FY07 country operating plan (COP) by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, which are expected no later than September 2008.

JSI?s current relationships with various local governments and key HCT and PC implementing partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) is essential to meet the above FY07 targets within the acceptable implementation framework. It would not be feasible for USAID to competitively source a new partner, who would require at least six months start-up, would not have data to report in the semi-annual report and would not be able to meet the targets for the annual report for the period ending September 30, 2008. 

USAID and the USG PEPFAR team are currently in the planning phase prior to a process of a full and open competition for PEPFAR II activities.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm may submit capability information to demonstrate the ability to satisfy the Government?s requirement in the timeframe required. Responses from firms received will be evaluated: however, USAID will not reimburse the respondent for any costs connected with providing such information. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Program Office will be conducting a limited competition for the Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, and production options, between Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control – Orlando, and McDonnell Douglas, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, the two incumbent contractors.  

SDB is a miniature munition weapon system intended to increase loadout for fighter, bomber, and unmanned aircraft while minimizing collateral damage. The SDB system consists of the all-up-round munition, carriage system, and support system.  The SDB will provide a near precision capability against fixed/ fixed-relocatable targets. The SDB program will design, develop, integrate, test and produce weapon systems for the F-15E and F-22.

<DESC>This activity will work on building the trade and business enabling environment in Haiti by providing support to the Government of Haiti and private sector associations.  The work carried out under this activity will support the Government's efforts to engage internationally on trade policy and increase the private sector's capacity to advocate on trade and investment issues.  It will build on on-going USAID projects in the areas of association development and maritime security, as well as on the important USAID initiative underway to facilitate investment in Haiti.  Increased public-private dialogue will be a key element to I-TRADE.  This activity will be expected to complement other USAID activities that seek to enhance production and the development of market value chains by addressing the internal and external barriers to trade.

The performance-based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase trade opportunities as well as the capacity of Haitians to take advantage of these opportunities through access to investment and trade information. As a result, USAID expects to see clear linkages between the I-TRADE project and related USAID development projects in the area of market development, and the resulting contribution to the number of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for one (1 EA) Kulite Pressure Transducer to be used to augment the existing pressure sensors of the exact same type for a planned NASA sponsored flight test.    NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the item from Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc.  Kulite's transducers are identical to the existing NASA owned transducers and will provide amplitude and phase matched response to the existing transducers. These additional transducers will significantly extend the array length possible in defining the spatial characteristics of turbulent boundary layers as a source of excitation for aerospace structures. Any other model transducer from other manufacturers will not provide the required matched response and would render the existing NASA owned transducers useless for the purposes of this test. Sole source authority for this procurement is FAR  13.106-1.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 15, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This RFI is not a formal solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested pharmacy/health care vendors, including small businesses, are invited to respond to this RFI.  The DoD will use information gained through this RFI to assess the fea sibility and cost-effectiveness of establishing GOCO pharmacies on Federal properties.  If the DoD decides to issue an RFP on this topic, more detailed information about specific pharmacy locations, expected volumes, and government interfaces will be made available.  All information currently available for this initiative is contained herein. PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES TO THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://GOCOrfi.fedworx.org (you must cut and paste to your browser) All questions submitted will be posted with answers on a continuous basis.  The last day for submittal of questions will be 15 October 2007.  Responses to this RFI are due 31 October 2007 Intent:   This Request for Information (RFI) is to assess the potential for the Department of Defense (DoD) to contract the management, staffing, and daily operations of DoD beneficiary community pharmacies located on Federal properties and to understand industry le ading practices for operating contracted pharmacies.  The DoD seeks to determine the cost-effectiveness of establishing new government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) pharmacies to better serve the pharmacy needs of the Military Health Systems (MHS) ben eficiaries.  New GOCO pharmacies are not intended to replace or reduce prescription volumes of existing pharmacies located in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).   Expected outcomes of establishing contractor operated pharmacies for the MHS include the ability to: "	Sustain current health care benefit by enhancing TRICARE beneficiary access to prescription drug benefit "	Continue to meet TRICARE beneficiary clinical and pharmaceutical needs in an effective, efficient, and fiscally responsible manner "	Utilize existing Federal purchasing contracts for pharmaceuticals dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries at DoD pharmacies "	Deploy additional licensed, accredited pharmacists and support staff while not reducing the number of uniform and civilian staff at existing Military Treatment Facility pharmacies The DoD anticipates that contracted DoD beneficiary community pharmacies would not serve as full drug stores.  They would operate on government-owned/leased properties including, but not limited to, military installations, DoD facilities, and other Federal  locations and may operate within an existing operation such as a Commissary or Military Exchange.  GOCO pharmacies may utilize a combination of contractor and government-owned systems to support daily operations; contractors are expected to provide near-r eal time archiving of health care treatment data that interfaces with either government or Pharmacy Benefits Manager systems.  Pharmaceuticals dispensed by the contracted pharmacies would be purchased and stocked by the government.  Access to contracted ph armacies would be strictly limited to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. Analysis is currently being performed to determine target locations and potential pilot sites for GOCO pharmacies.  All TRICARE regions (South, West, North) are being considered with the target of identifying up to 10 sites that can attract and maintain av erage daily volumes of 300  500 prescriptions. Background:   The MHS mission is to enhance the DoD and the Nations security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to its care.  One of the components of the MHS is the operation of a heal th care plan for 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries  TRICARE.  The TRICARE program is managed by TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) under the authority of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.  TMA administers an integrated TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program which offers pharm acy services to eligible beneficiaries through direct care pharmacies located at MTF hospitals and clinics, the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) program, and the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy (TRRx) program.  The TRRx program allows eligible beneficiaries to o btain pharmacy services through either TRICARE retail network pharmacies or otherwise authorized retail non-network pharmacies.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, 536 MTF pharmacies filled 49.4 million 30-day equivalent prescriptions, TMOP filled 23.6 million 30-d ay equivalent prescriptions, and over 54,000 retail pharmacies filled 58.8 million 30-day equivalent prescriptions.  In addition, the three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the three channels is the following:  MTF -2.6%; TMOP 8.6%; Retail 11.4% . Despite being the most cost-effective channel for beneficiaries, MTF workload has decreased; most likely the result of several MTF pharmacy access challenges: "	Lack of convenience o	Limited hours of MTF pharmacy operation o	Insufficient parking on military installations o	Long wait times at MTF pharmacies "	Limited MTF pharmacy product inventories and inventory levels "	Retiree and retiree-dependant population concentrations in areas without MTF pharmacies Information Requested from Industry: In responding to this RFI, potentially interested parties are asked to submit information on the following: 1.	Please provide the name of your organization and contact information for your main point of contact for this RFI. 2.	Briefly describe the scope of contracted pharmacy services available in the marketplace and your opinion on how these services could apply to the Military Health System. 3.	If you have experience with managing, staffing, and/or operating contracted pharmacies for government agencies or private sector organizations, please provide a summary of your scope of services. 4.	Based on industry leading practices and/or your experiences, please describe the expected requirements in regards to the following: a.	Time to set up a contracted pharmacy b.	Infrastructure related to square footage, construction, facility design, layout, etc. c.	Staffing models  appropriate mix of pharmacists, technicians and administrative staff d.	Key technologies / processes used (e.g., robotics, telepharmacy, drive-through) e.	Equipment and supplies f.	Typical operating days and hours g.	Average daily volumes h.	Formulary requirements, initial drug stocking and inventory levels i.	Other requirements / variables 5.	Please describe the standard processes for: a.	Supplies and pharmaceuticals procurement b.	Prescription filling c.	Eligibility verification d.	Claims processing e.	Other key processes 6.	Please describe any variations in approach for operating contracted pharmacies that may exist due to differences in the following: a.	Prescription volume b.	Beneficiary population demographics and culture c.	Geographic location d.	Payor mix e.	Stand-alone versus / front-store model (e.g., contained within commissary or Military exchange) f.	Other potential variables 7.	What factors and metrics are typically used to measure the success of a community pharmacy operation (e.g., fully-loaded cost per square foot and/or prescription)? 8.	Briefly describe the technical interfaces typically used in environments with contracted pharmacies.  What recommendations do you have to enable efficient interface between contractor systems and DoD systems?  What additional technical requirements may be necessary for interfacing and implementation? 9.	What should the DoD consider related to legal restrictions, governing bodies, state licensure, zoning restrictions, etc.? 10.	What are the advantages and/or disadvantages of operating multiple contracted pharmacies versus a single contracted pharmacy for a client? 11.	What types of compensation arrangements are typically used for contracted pharmacies?  What would you recommend for the Military Health Sys tem based on expected volumes of 300-500 prescriptions per day?

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 ? Dated October 4, 2007:  The small business subcontracting goal for woman-owned small business has been changed from 5% to 10%.  This is found in Criteria 7.

DESCRIPTION:  This is an unrestricted procurement. There is no solicitation to download.  Architect/Engineer (A/E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Renovation/Repair and New Construction of Facilities. The work for this contract shall occur at various Navy and Marine Corps facilities and other government facilities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.  The preponderance of the work is in California.  
Required services are for Engineering Studies and Site Investigation Reports to support new development on raw land, or re-development of existing developed sites; preparation of Requests for Proposals (RFP) for Design-Build Projects; preparation of fully designed plans and specifications for Invitation for Bid (IFB) projects; other engineering designs, studies, reports, cost estimates, evaluations, and construction support services.
The general scope of this contract includes the preparation of designs,  drawings, specifications, and design-build Request for  Proposal (RFP) packages for repair, renovation and minor construction, demolition and new  construction at various facilities, such as, but not limited to, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters, Food Services facilities, Fitness Centers, Laboratories, Training Facilities, Industrial Facilities, Stores, etc.  Services shall include design of interior and exterior alterations and repair incorporating the coordination of various architectural-engineering disciplines, and the differing aspects of phasing of construction that involves occupied and unoccupied facilities for the purpose of providing construction documentation.  An integrated project design approach shall incorporate sustainable design elements that will lead to substantial improvements in life-cycle operations and reduce life-cycle costs. Task orders may require the preparation of supporting engineering documentation, including Site Investigations, General Landscape and Irrigation, Mechanical, plumbing and Electrical Design Systems, Cost Estimates, and Economic Analyses to develop and define actual costs of construction projects, including special costs for Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems, Anti Terrorism and Force Protection AT/FP, utilities, seismic reinforcement analysis, Blast analysis and structural investigation, and geo-technical engineering requirements.  Projects may also require the identification and removal of asbestos and lead-based paint and other hazardous materials.

The maximum contract value may not exceed $7,500,000 aggregate total.  The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order.  The minimum amount of individual task orders issued under this contract is $500,000.  There is no maximum dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.  Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods.  Each performance period will run 365 calendar days.  The hourly rates will be negotiated for each calendar (12 month period) year and are independent of which option year is in effect.  The government may exercise the option period unilaterally.  Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise.  The estimated start date is March 2008. Brooks Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. This procurement is unrestricted.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 and the annual small business size standard is $4.5 Million.     

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

<DESC>Q. Are you looking at alternative solutions, for example, liquid cooled vests to replace the current MCS in the Paladin Howitzer M109A6? A. The Paladin system is not looking to incorporate liquid cooled vests into the system at this time.  The primary function of the MCS (Microclimatic CONDITIONING System) is to provide NBC filtered air to the crew.  It also has the functionality to provide cooled NBC filtered air.  The purpose of this solicitation is to handle the reliability problems of our current MCS by  upgrading some of the components on the MCS system (completing the conversion to R134a, etc).  We acknowledge that liquid cooled vests are available, they do not completely solve our situation of providing NBC filtered air to the crew and thus are not an acceptable solution to this solicitation. Q. Can you please provide the location of the current MCS within the Paladin? A. The MCS unit is located within the MCS enclosure on the roof of the Paladin Cab.

<SUBJECT>B -- Updating NWCC Document Entitled 'Studying Wind Energy/Bird Interactions: A Guidance Document'
<SOLNBR>REE-8-77581
<RESPDATE>101907
<ARCHDATE>11032007
<CONTACT>Kim Tangler, Subcontract Administrator II, Phone 303-384-7018, Fax 303-384-6901, Email kim_tangler@nrel.gov - Kim Tangler, Subcontract Administrator II, Phone 303-384-7018, Fax 303-384-6901, Email kim_tangler@nrel.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for updating Studying Wind Energy/Bird Interactions: A Guidance Document (see http://www.nationalwind.org/publications/wildlife/avian99/Avian_booklet.pdf), a 1999 document originally prepared for the Avian Subcommittee of the National Wind Coordinating Committee (go to http://www.nationalwind.org/ for information on the  NWCC), now called the Wildlife Workgroup of the National Wind Coordinating Collaborative.

The 1999 document?s purpose was four-fold:
1)	Provide a thorough reference document for use by all stakeholders that would, if followed, result in a body of information adequate to reliably assist in turbine pre-siting assessment.
2)	Provide clear methods, metrics and definitions for use in the study of wind energy/bird interactions.
3)	Promote efficient, cost-effective study designs, methods and metrics that will produce comparable data, reducing the need for overlapping studies.
4)	Provide study designs and methods for collection of information useful in reducing risk to birds in existing and future wind plants.

Studying Wind Energy/Bird Interactions: A Guidance Document focuses on avian activity and the use of wind farm habitats by birds.  It presents tools and scientific protocols for efficient and accurate characterization of use of proposed/operational wind farm development sites by birds.  The document was intended to be exhaustive in nature, reviewing all the latest ?tools,? scientific technologies and accepted research protocols, and published literature pertinent to studying birds at land-based wind facilities nationwide. 

Objective:  The objective of the solicitation is to update Studying Wind Energy/Bird Interactions: A Guidance Document with the best available information.  The revised document must be presented from a neutral perspective with the focus on objectivity and credibility of the material.

This Request for Proposal will seek a strategy to update the original 1999 Studying Wind Energy/Bird Interactions: A Guidance Document with current information. The subcontractor shall, to the extent feasible, evaluate the ability of the techniques proposed in the original document to successfully predict probability of impact or habitat disturbance to birds and other wildlife.  The updated document shall contain information about the value, cost, and practical issues associated with known techniques and will add information about the new techniques that have proven effective predictors of impact.  It will provide information about promising new technologies and associated limitations or qualifications of those technologies, including costs of the technologies.  In addition, the RFP will seek suggestions for other topics to address, such as, for example, which of the methods minimize probability of impact.

The RFP will seek a strategy to update the document, including a proposed approach for evaluating material for inclusion in a revised document.  Suggestions for additions or alterations to the current document will be encouraged.  The proposal should also present a proposed approach for assuring the material in the document is presented from a neutral perspective with the focus on objectivity and credibility of the material.
  
Potential respondents should be aware that in 2006, the NWCC Wildlife Workgroup contracted for a companion document to be developed entitled Methods and Metrics for Assessing Impacts of Wind Energy Development on Nocturnally Active Birds and Bats.  This document addresses: 1) potential impacts on resident and migratory populations; 2) fatality rates on resident and migratory populations; 3) the causes of bird and bat fatalities; and 4) methods for reducing risks to bird and bat populations and their habitats.  The manuscript is complete and is scheduled for publication by the Journal of Wildlife Management by December 2007.  Thus, the updated document being called for under this RFP will NOT need to address nocturnal species; it will be a companion to the nocturnal document.

In addition, subcontractors will not be responsible for final layout, design or printing of the document.  Those tasks will be taken care of by NREL.

Offeror?s qualifications: Desired qualifications of respondents include:
1.	Demonstrated experience in creating guidance documents on studying wildlife species;
2.	Experience in research on birds (and/or birds and bats), and the analysis of that research;
3.	Familiarity with the Methods and Metrics for Assessing Impacts of Wind Energy Development on Nocturnally Active Birds and Bats
4.	Experience or understanding of commercial wind power development projects
5.	Experience in studying wind development?s affect on birds and other wildlife or their habitat;
6.	Strong writing ability and strong organizational skills;
7.	Demonstrated ability to produce on time, and work within a budget; 
8.	Access to library facilities/databases; 
9.	Ability to work in a neutral and unbiased manner with parties representing a cross section of interests; 
10.	Credibility with the various sectors represented on the NWCC and the Wildlife Workgroup.

Solicitation Plan: NREL is planning to release an RFP in Fall 2007.  It is anticipated that the subcontract will be awarded in early 2008.

Selection Criteria: Selection Criteria include: 

1.	high level of objectivity demonstrating a balanced viewpoint;
2.	quality of the proposed approach including thoroughness, creativity, clarity, and project implementation and management plans; 
3.	strong credibility of team, comprised of multiple technical experts with credibility among a diverse group of key stakeholders, based on experience and capabilities; and,
4.	cost.

Consistent with the consensus-based approach used by the NWCC Wildlife Workgroup (WL WG) that resulted in the completion of the document Methods and Metrics for Assessing Impacts of Wind Energy Development on Nocturnally Active Birds and Bats, NREL will be will be looking for, among other things, a qualified individual or team that offers the best plan to meet the project objectives with input from all stakeholder groups represented on the WL WG.  
Review Process of Revised Document:  The NWCC WL WG will play a role by providing input to NREL on the critical review, comments and recommendations for adoption of the final document.  It should be noted that the NWCC WL WG operates on a consensus basis.  This means that the report review process may be more thorough and time consuming than other subcontract activities.  

The subcontractor shall submit a first draft of the document to NREL for review and comment by the WL WG and other selected reviewers.  At least one, and potentially as many as three, additional reviews will likely be required to finalize the document in preparation for publication.  If possible, this document will be submitted to a selected Peer Review Journal.

Expressions of Interest: The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to develop a list of parties interested in participating in this Solicitation and responding to the RFP.

Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving notification when the RFP is released, if they indicate that desire.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and email addresses of the primary contact person; a brief description of the Offeror?s qualifications as they relate to the desired qualifications indicated in this notice; and, a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive notification when the RFP is released. Responses to this notice should not exceed one page.  Responses should be received at NREL by 5pm on 10/19/07.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses (by mail, facsimile or email).

2 DUE DATE:
October 12, 2007, 3 PM EDT
3 INTRODUCTION
The US Small Business Administration (SBA) relies on mainframe based legacy systems to support its mission of providing and servicing small business and disaster loans. These mainframe based legacy systems support the full life cycle (including financial management) of the following loan, loan guaranty and investment programs:
?7(a)
?504
?Disaster (except loan origination)
?Microloan
?SBIC
Details about SBA and its loan programs can be found at http://www.sba.gov/.
These mainframe-based loan processing and accounting systems are inflexible and use obsolete technology. These stove piped systems are very expensive to maintain. These legacy systems don?t meet SBA?s current business needs and are very expensive to change to comply with current and future business needs. These systems are not compliant with accepted Federal security requirements, Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 and Financial System Integration Office?s (FSIO, also known as JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements, Direct Loan Systems Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements. These systems are inefficient, outdated and don?t take advantage of technological advances. They have been in place for approximately 50 years and significantly contribute to the amount of data reconciliation and manual processes required to do business. 
Consequently, SBA has initiated a Loan Modernization effort to modernize its Loan Management and Loan Accounting Systems that will support loan origination, servicing, liquidation and financial management for its loan and loan guarantee programs. 
The scope of the Loan Modernization program is to:
?Incrementally implement a single Integrated Loan Management System to support 7(a), 504, Microloan, Disaster and SBIC programs. The Loan Management system will support the full life cycle - Origination, Servicing and Liquidation - for these loan programs. The only exception is Disaster Loan Origination which is outside the scope of this program.
?Implement a single Integrated Financial Management System by leveraging the investment made in FSIO (formerly JFMIP) compliant Oracle Financials that supports the Agency?s Administrative Accounting.
?Comply with E-Gov initiatives, like FMLoB, to achieve economies of scale by using public or private shared service provider for integration, implementation, hosting and application management.
?The resulting system must comply with:
o Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
o Debt Collection Act.
o Circular A-127 and A-130
o FSIO?s (formerly JFMIP) Direct Loan, Guarantee Loan and Core Financial System Requirements.
o Federal security requirements
o Other federal requirements
SBA will acquire the services of a solution provider who will help SBA modernize and host its Loan Management and Accounting System. 
However, at this point of time, SBA requires Program/Project Management expertise for this effort and this sources sought notice is to identify viable businesses that can perform this work. The Program/Project Management service provider will help SBA plan, manage, execute, monitor, control and closeout this effort.

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) will not issue paper copies of this request.  The information in this survey is being compiled to provide a database of available technologies to be evaluated for benefits to US Marine Corps mobile Auxiliary Power Units (APU).  Additionally, the survey will assist in the identification of science and technology gaps and opportunities available to further advance the state of the art. The data fields included are the basic information that will allow ONR to make accurate comparisons between the various systems and equipments of both current and future technology.  The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of future science and technology development programs.  There is no commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request
<br>
<br>
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) APU:
<br>
<br>
Modular, compact, high temperature fuel cell systems provide a potential for high efficient, silent power for US Marine Corps (USMC) Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) applications. The Office of Naval Research desires to gather and evaluate performance data for high temperature fuel cell technology and compatible energy recovery machinery, having potential application to mobile APUs operating with Navy logistic fuel (JP8) and future alternative fuels.
<br>
<br> 
Survey:
<br>
<br>
The survey provided herein requests quantitative data for systems and equipment that will populate a technology readiness versus performance database.  Performance data for complete power systems, as well as component technology (or sub-systems) is solicited.  Data for existing equipment, as well as projected performance of ongoing research and development efforts is solicited.  Key areas under evaluation include, but are not limited to, fuel pre-processing, fuel reforming, solid oxide fuel cell stack technologies, contaminant mitigation, power conversion, power management, and bottoming cycles including stirling, thermal-electric and other technologies.
<br>
<br>
The study will evaluate current and upcoming technology expected to be available for transition to an ONR sponsored nominal 10kWe Solid Oxide Fuel Cell based APU demonstration effort starting in 2010.  This system is planned to be developed and demonstrated on the USMC Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) platform.  The system should be adaptable to other potential mobile fuel cell APU applications, and be compatible with future fuels such as synthetic diesel fuel and desulfurized JP-8.  
<br>
<br>
This survey effort will define and focus development and critical design efforts towards technologies that provide the best value to performance.  The studies will identify science and technology shortfalls in order to focus exploratory development efforts required prior to initiation of the APU demonstration program.  This undertaking is expected to serve as the foundation for developing a roadmap to achieve a working model for a mobile fuel cell APU.  
<br>
<br>
We request industry leaders and innovators across the spectrum to provide the survey information for systems/equipment you are operating, manufacturing, or developing which could benefit the effort described above.  Responses are requested no later than 26 October 2007.  However, surveys received late will be reviewed if time allows. This RFI is a survey of applicable technologies, and is not a solicitation for proposals.  All data will be treated as proprietary to preserve the intellectual property rights of the participants.  
<br>
<br>
We request that you provide as much data as is possible to allow us to perform comparisons.  All systems, regardless of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) will be reviewed and evaluated. For current systems please provide empirical information as available.  For systems in development or planned for development please provide best estimates for the information.    
<br>
<br>
This survey is divided into five areas of interest, as follows.  Each area of interest has two pages devoted to questions concerning that particular technology area. 
<br>
<br>
(1) Overall System Configuration
(2) Fuel Processing
(3) SOFC Stacks
(4) Air Filtration
(5) Energy Recovery
<br>
<br>
The survey area for each technology requests general information about the technology and the status of the program.  Please provide a Point of Contact (POC) name and contact information for the survey information who can answer questions concerning the data provided.  The survey asks for a brief description of the technology program and the expected benefit of the approach over current or competing technology. For systems currently in use, please describe the primary users of the system, e.g., power utilities, military vehicles, and commercial operators, foreign and domestic.  For system under development or planned for development, please provide a synopsis of the status of the program and the steps required to progress to production and demonstration of the technology.
<br>
<br>
The survey also requests specific physical and operational characteristics.  For items in Development, use projected parameters.  The questions aim to obtain a description of the equipment and provide baseline operating data to determine system capacities and performance characteristics.  Please provide as much detail, including information we may not have requested or oversimplified, concerning the specific equipment technology operating and performance characteristics as is necessary to accurately assess the capabilities and benefits of the technology.  A subset of the questions identify System Interface Requirements.  As in the previous section we have tried to identify some baseline parameters for the different categories of equipment.

<DESC>1. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a comprehensive Special Operations Forces (SOF) C-130 performance enhancement study to meet the growing requirements for weight reduction, increased range, improved power/propulsion requirements and overall aerodynamic performance shortfalls by assessing potential modifications and upgrades for the Air Force Special Operations Command?s (AFSOC) C-130 aircraft inventory to 2025.  Prioritized Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft in this study are the AC-130U, MC-130H, AC-130H, MC-130W, MC-130P, and MC-130E. A range of alternatives is desired, from near-term (fielding prior to 2015) through long-term (2015 to 2025).  The MC-130E/P aircraft will primarily be considered for near-term upgrades only, as they are programmed for recapitalization.  To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.

2.  The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or commercially available solutions to SOF C-130 performance challenges, assess technology and manufacturing readiness, and prepare budgetary planning estimates for possible programming initiatives.

3.  USSOCOM seeks information from responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed systems integration requirements; can be validated by performance testing, including flight test; require minimum modification or upgrade to aircraft systems; address sustainment concerns.

4.  For the purpose of this RFI, the term -proven- means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or higher, preferably TRL 7 or higher.  Adaptation of NDI or commercial solutions is encouraged.  Recommended solutions must improve upon current SOF C-130 capability and be sustainable through the expected life above.  Key performance parameters include loiter time, Cg, and climb gradient in various environmental conditions.

5.  Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the required performance enhancement challenges with low integration risk across the SOF C-130 inventory.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information on all or any subset of the areas listed.  No adverse evaluation will result from responses, which address only those specific areas applicable to one?s core business expertise.

6.  Respondents are to use a minimum number of pages to describe in detail the information requested.  Limit responses to no more than fifty 8 ? x 11 inch single sided pages, including attachments, figures and/or drawings.  

7.  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the -art of the possible- from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for possible uses of platforms within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and protected as such.  All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure.  The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.  

Special Note:  Respondent?s attention is directed to the fact that contractor consultant and advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement integrity laws and shall sign Non-Disclosure and Rules of Conduct/Conflict of Interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submissions in response to this RFI constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government Support Contractors.

8.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms with appropriate Export Control status are permitted to respond to this RFI.  Responses to questions from authorized interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company?s response.  One-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are currently not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to those responders that meet the requirements contained in this RFI.  The purpose would be to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.

9.  Per FAR 52.215-3,  Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Although the terms -proposal- and -respondent- are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal. Any proposed solution must meet all Operational, Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) requirements mandated by the Department of Defense.

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for preparation of working drawings and specifications, cost estimates, submittal review, other construction period services for a variety of Non-Recurring Maintenance (NRM) projects at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse.  It is the intent to complete all designs as soon as possible in Fiscal Year 2008 (FY08) for construction award in FY 08, dependent on the approval of the projects and availability of construction funding.  If construction is not approved and awarded in FY 08, it is the intent to award the construction early in FY 09. There are fourteen (14) separate tasks that may be included in this intended award, dependent upon VA's design budget and the fee schedule negotiated with the most highly ranked firm.  The brief descriptions below summarize those tasks in a somewhat descending order of importance dependent again upon available funding.  Each task may result in a separate construction contract award, but it is much more likely that many will be combined.  During the initial design phase, evaluations will be made as to which tasks might be efficiently combined to result in fewer construction awards.  Please refer to these tasks collectively as "INTERIOR A-E DESIGNS" and use the RFI number VA-528-08-RI-0005 to identify your submission to this announcement. .

<SUBJECT>73 -- Notice of Intent to procure Kitchen equipment for the new Social Security Administration facility in Birmingham, AL using the firm of OPUS South Corporation.
<DESC>The General Services Administration is providing its notice of intent to procure Kitchen equipment using other than competitive procedures for the firm of OPUS South Corporation (OPUS), Atlanta, Georgia, for us in the new Social Security Administration facility in Birmingham, AL.

OPUS was originally selected under a Source Selection process to provide leased space.  The contract also included all the initial space alteration required for the Government to meet its operational requirements and was awarded under contract GS-04B-45056.  The food service equipment and material to be provided under this contract would include shelving, work tables, slicers, mixers, refrigerators, freezers, warmers, heated sandwich slides, carving station, beverage dispensers, toasters, cup dispensers, ice cream dispenser, display cases, dish and glass dollys and other minor equipment require to make a full and functioning cafeteria and dish washing facility. This equipment is to be integrated into to the kitchen and serving area designed by OPUS and must be compatible and integrated with other materials and equipment being provided and installed by OPUS.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, OPUS South Corporation can accomplish the work with favorable results since they are currently responsible for providing all the related material, equipment and infrastructure to make the equipment to be purchased operational and functions.  Having a single source for the entire kitchen build out will ensure a fully integrated and operational kitchen. 

OPUS South Corporation is responsible for the entire initial space alterations of which valued at over $27 million.  This equipment is a small part the initial space alterations.  OPUS has the staffing and manpower to complete the work prior to the contract delivery date.  OPUS utilized competition to select the vendor to install the infrastructure, and fixed kitchen equipment.  As part of the vendor?s proposal they also provided an optional price for the equipment sought under this justification.

The introduction of a new vendor into the job may prevent the equipment from being fully integrated into the custom fabricated infrastructure or fixed equipment.  The single source will also provide a single point of contact for all warranty issues, limiting confusion on time on what equipment is covered by each contractor.  

The expedited performance through their unique project knowledge, experience, and extensive documentation of current conditions, would result in less risk and impact to the government.   The requirement to procure these additional services and equipment under full and open competition would result in increased time, costs and risks to the Government because of the problems involved with additional coordination, mobilization, and multiple contractors working within the same space.  Therefore, this procurement is planned as other than full-and-open-competition-basis on the grounds that OPUS  is the only practical firm that can provide this equipment.  The total estimated range of this action is approximately $140,000 - $160,000.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government intent or obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Wylene Bell, Contracting Officer, phone 404-331-4617, facsimile 404-331-7696, at wylene.bell@gsa.gov or, GSA, Acquisition Management Division (4PGA), 401 W.

<SUBJECT>67 -- Notice of Intent to procure Audio Visual equipment for the new Social Security Administration facility in Birmingham, AL using the firm of OPUS South Corporation.
<DESC>The General Services Administration is providing its notice of intent to procure Audio Visual equipment using other than competitive procedures for the firm of OPUS South Corporation (OPUS), Atlanta, Georgia, for use in the new Social Security Administration facility in Birmingham, AL.

OPUS was originally selected under a Source Selection process to provide leased space.  The contract also included all the initial space alterations required for the Government to meet its operational requirements and was awarded under contract GS-04B-45056.  The equipment and material to be provided under this contract would include projectors, video players, interface devices, processors, touch panels, microphones, amplifiers, racks and software. This equipment is to be integrated into to the system designed by OPUS and be compatible with other materials and equipment being provided by OPUS.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, OPUS South Corporation can accomplish the work with favorable results since they are currently responsible for providing all the related material, equipment and infrastructure to make the equipment to be purchased operational and functions.

OPUS has the staffing and manpower to complete the work prior to the contract delivery date.  OPUS utilized competition to select the vendor to install the infrastructure; the vendors also provided an optional price for the equipment sought under this justification.

The introduction of a new vendor into the job may prevent the system from being fully integrated and create a difficult diagnostic situation if the equipment fails.  There would be two vendors responsible for the operational aspects of the system.

The expedited performance through their unique project knowledge, experience, and extensive documentation of current conditions, would result in less risk and impact to the government.   The requirement to procure these additional services and equipment  under full and open competition would result in increased time, costs and risks to the Government because of the problems involved with additional coordination, mobilization, and multiple contractors working within the same space.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Marine Corps Program Curriculum Development
<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWC TSD) has a requirement to provide contractor non-personal technical support services for the design and development of curricula for all USMC Type/Model/Series aviation training systems and training organizations (FRS, ATS, MAWTS-1, etc). These curricula will establish the requirements for courseware and training systems, which will be procured competitively under TSC II. This requirement is being solicited as a sole source procurement action to Aviation Training Consulting (ATC), Inc.  NAWC TSD awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm-fixed price delivery orders on 18 July 2005 to Aviation Training Consulting, LLC (ATC).  The period of performance is thirty-six months.  The maximum budget for this effort is being increased to $29,000,000.

The contractor will provide the Government curricula in the format necessary to facilitate the Marine Corps goal of achieving a concurrency management process.  ATC has completed the 100 level curriculum for the USMC MV-22 and KC-130J Programs.  The curriculum format is unique, as well as the process of using a comprehensive master task list in its development. The primary purpose for developing common curricula is to enable the use of a Training Concurrency Integration (TCI) process for the Marine Corps.  ATC is currently under contract with NAWC TSD to develop and test the TCI process using the Configuration Database Application (CDA).  In order to ensure that the subject curricula is properly formatted and compatible with the final TCI process, and to ensure that curricula content re-use is maximized where possible, it is in the best interest of the government to contract for all required Marine Aviation curricula and curricula configuration management with ATC until the TCI process and tools are completed, tested, fielded and validated by ATC and delivered to the government.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

To carry out our goals and mandates, NRCS has determined that it will need to acquire through procurement the previously stated services and supplies for a total estimated cost of $44,100. 

Item (4)
The Corvallis Plant Materials Center is located on OSU property and has leased farm land and building space from OSU for decades. The yearly charge of $1 for building space is obviously cost effective.  Being located on the OSU Hyslop Farm, plant materials center staff is free to use OSU specialty farm equipment whenever needed thus saving valuable time and money for the program. OSU is able to meet all of the specifications needed by the Plant Materials Center including building space, on-site irrigation wells, shop services, facility maintenance and equipment operators for the same cost charged to other OSU facilities and programs.

Item (5)
The Corvallis Plant Materials Center has been located on the OSU Hyslop Farm for decades. The land lease rate charged to NRCS is cheaper than similar farm land in the area. NRCS is able to buy local supplies under this OSU purchase order for major discounts because of our association with the college. The Plant Material Center is also able to get field inspections done for free because of our association with the farm, which saves hundreds of dollars. Beside the overall cost advantage offered by OSU, the technical expertise of OSU faculty and staff is invaluable. Because of our long standing relationship, techniques and equipment have been developed over the years that make farming small areas such as ours very cost effective not offered by different locations.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis for Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) Storage and Maintenance of Government Furnished Materials
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command on behalf of the JVAP JPMO intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a one-year extension to a contract line item for storage and maintenance of Government Furnished Materials.  This line item is part  of an advanced development effort that is executed as a cost plus award fee contract.  The purpose of this acquisition is to maintain continuity of services provided by the JVAP prime systems contractor, DVC, in Frederick, MD.  These materials include leg acy materials produced by contractors to the United State Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC).  Appropriate storage, shipping, and maintenance is needed to support activities regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.  The regulated ac tivities include maintenance of Investigational New Drug (IND) status for biodefense vaccines, which requires periodic testing of potency, sterility, and other characteristics.  DVC has provided these service for JVAP for the past nine years.  JVAP JPMO co ntemplated transfer ot materials to another Army program but that other office has experienced delays in preparing for the transfer.  Consequently, the contract line item will be extended while the other Army office completes its effort to effect a hand-of f of stored material.  The JVAP JPMO must ensure uniterrupted access and continuity of its testing program and, unable to transfer the material, is required to consider the most efficient, short-term solution.  This contract action is intended to be accomp lished noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Parties purporting to have the facilities and skills necessary to perform these Food and Drug Administrations controlled services without unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements must furnish, in writing, factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates capability to provide sto rage, shipping, and maintenance services as described above.  This information must be e-mailed to Leo Fratis at Leo.Fratis@us.army.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)619-5069 by close of business October 19, 2007.  A determination not to compete this p roposed action based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the contracting officer.

<DESC>This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an extended field-of-view (FOV) integrating sphere light source for absolute calibration of imaging spectrograph instrumentation.  Requirements are as follows:  Sphere configuration requirements:  The source shall be a 12 in. diameter sphere with a 4 in. diameter exit port. A removable reducer shall be included to limit the exit port diameter to 2 in. The source shall allow operation with the exit port facing horizontally or, optionally, downward. A mounting flange for attaching the source exit port to NASA Ames instrumentation shall be included. The flange is primarily for alignment reproducibility and is not intended to be a load-bearing attachment. The frame supporting the sphere shall be load-bearing for horizontal or downward orientations. Detailed mechanical drawings and mechanical requirements for supporting the sphere in the horizontal or downward orientations shall be included in the offer. Ports for nitrogen cooling and purging shall be incorporated. All power and electronic components shall be housed in standard 19” rack mount cases.  Light sources and spectral radiance performance requirements:  The spectral range of the source shall be from &lt; 250 nm to &gt; 1700 nm. The reflectance coating of the sphere shall have maximum performance and lifetime in the ultraviolet region; offerers shall include documentation of the coating specifications. The sphere shall have a combination of external xenon arc and tungsten-halogen light sources and one or more internal tungsten-halogen sources. The sources shall be independently controlled to tailor the spectral radiance for maximum output over two spectral subregions: ultraviolet to visible (250 - 800 nm) and near infrared (800 - 1700 nm). The sphere source shall meet or, preferably, exceed the following absolute spectral radiance performance specifications consistent with independent (or all) lamp configurations described above: &gt; 35 W/cm3 sr at 300 nm; &gt; 2800 W/cm3 sr at 500 nm; &gt; 6500 W/cm3 sr at 800 nm; &gt; 6800 W/cm3 sr at 1100 nm; &gt; 3400 W/cm3 sr at 1700 nm. The source shall meet or exceed these specifications without the near infrared discrete line output of the xenon lamp; the line structure of xenon emission between 800 nm and 1000 nm shall be filtered or otherwise absent. The stability variation of the tungsten-halogen sources shall not exceed 0.02%; the stability variation of the xenon source shall not exceed 0.2%. The luminance uniformity over the 4 in. dia. exit port shall be &gt; 96%. The expected lamp lifetimes shall also be documented in the offer.  Note: that absolute spectral radiance from the ultraviolet to the infrared is the primary, but not exclusive, technical performance metric to be considered in evaluating offers. See below for further evaluation information regarding best value selection. System performance monitoring and control requirements:  The external light sources shall have motorized variable attenuators. The attenuators shall also act as shutters to inhibit output while the lamps are operating. The variable output shall have linear control under software from 0 to 100%. The sphere shall include a calibrated radiometer for monitoring luminance. A calibrated spectroradiometer for monitoring spectral radiance shall also be included. The spectroradiometer shall, at minimum, cover the range 350-1050 nm. The source absolute radiance shall be scaled to the radiometer and spectroradiometer output to enable quantifiable control of absolute spectral radiance at settings below full output power. The lamp usage shall be monitored automatically, either through control software or the lamp power supplies.  Calibrations:  The source shall have NIST-traceable absolute spectral radiance calibrations and uncertainties for the full-power configurations of the lamp sources (e.g. xenon only, tungsten-halogen only; all). The spectral resolution of the calibration shall be 10 nm or less. At minimum, the spectral radiance calibration shall be certified for wavelengths between 300 nm to 1700 nm. Non-certified spectral radiance calibrations at wavelengths from 250 nm to 300 nm, and from 1700 nm to 2400 nm are also required. A spatial map of source luminance uniformity mapping shall be included. The time over which the calibrations are valid (i.e. lamp hours, calendar dates) shall also be documented.  Warranty and technical support:  Offers shall include terms of post-sale warranty, technical support, and performance guarantees.  Deliverables:  Complete integrating sphere system (sphere, light sources, power supplies, control electronics); Radiometer and spectroradiometer monitors; Calibration certificates; Safety and hazard analyses; Manuals  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-20. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334516 and 500 respectively. The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.16 per hour or $126.40 per week or $547.73 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; and 3 weeks after 5 years. Length of service includes the whole span
of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever
employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar
work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay
in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR
4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS
(as numbered):

1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.


** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state
or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by
an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the
wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance
with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the
actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance
is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors
subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide
collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the
furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all
employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67
cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are
made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other
personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry
cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the
cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,
by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement
that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.


** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **

Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the
Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes,
prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only
upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage
determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract,
adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective
bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that
Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under
section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage
determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits
paid under the predecessor contract.

Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993,
as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise
indicated. This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of
Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Copies of specific job
descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard
Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which
is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the
work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished
the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be
initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such
unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or
fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.
{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a
contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to
which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in
order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for
each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed
wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of
the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no
authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be
submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted
class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a
report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the
Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of
Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to
process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the
contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond
paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in
the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required
tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage
determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or
subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
