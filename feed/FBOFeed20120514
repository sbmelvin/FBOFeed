However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />4. Objectives: This is a contract for work of providing technical and programmatic support to grantees collecting and reporting the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) data, some of whom are using CDC-provided software, to CDC. Implementation, modification, and reporting of NHM&amp;E data will continue during the period covered by this project, so continuing assistance to grantees is essential.</p>
<p>5. Background for the Acquisition. In 2004, CDC responded to the need for more accurate and timely data for monitoring HIV prevention programs by developing and implementing the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) [formerly known as the Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) variables]. NHM&amp;E is a national set of standardized HIV prevention data variables. To assist in the collection and reporting of the NHM&amp;E data, CDC designed and provided optional, secure web-based software for data entry and management and a range of data collection training and software implementation support services. CDC is now in the midst of a multi-year process of transitioning to another, yet-to-be-determined data collection and reporting software system or systems. NHM&amp;E data variables are also being revised, with the revisions going into effect in 2012. Data will include client-level demographics and HIV risk behaviors, community-level intervention data, structural intervention information, syringe exchange information and bio-medical intervention data. Collection of these variables allows for more detailed and comprehensive reporting of HIV prevention activities including fiscal information, client service data, and data required for calculating the program performance indicators. NHM&amp;E data collection and reporting is required of 69 health departments and approximately 200 community-based organizations (CBOs) funded through CDC HIV cooperative agreements to deliver or support HIV prevention services.</p>
<p>To support the successful implementation of NHM&amp;E and to meet federal data reporting and security requirements it is necessary to provide technical support by e-mail, telephone, and other means to grantees reporting NHM&amp;E data and to track and document end-user requests and responses. This technical support is intended to provide accurate, consistent communication concerning programmatic NHM&amp;E and local data usage issues, to identify elements of software needing modification, to identify grantees in need of enhanced technical assistance, to coordinate access to online and other training materials, and to monitor the implementation of the NHM&amp;E data collections and use of the CDC supplied software.</p>

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NHGRI Medical Genetic Branch (MGB) uses both Microscopes throughout the institute and there is an important need to ensure this equipment is operational at all times. The research of this lab involves cell biology and a lot of photomicroscopy. The confocal fluorescent microscope and associated lasers and instrumentation require both preventative maintenance and periodic service for repairs to keep it functioning property. The Service Agreements allows for quick repair if needed and regular maintenance work to ensure continued use of the equipment. Both Microscopes are a sophisticated piece of equipment that enables investigators to make observations that cannot be made by conventional fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, the microscopes are used for sophisticated types of experiments. A Service Contract is required to reduce downtime and allow users access to new software upgrades. Replacement parts and repairs are prohibitively expensive without a pre-arranged service contract in place. Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC is the manufacturer of both Microscopes, only a licensed Carl Zeiss Engineer or Technician can service the instruments and no other source or service is acceptable.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI), 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room #10C-107, Clinical Research Center, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.</p>

<p>&bull; Scheduled and Emergency service performed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays;<br />&bull; All travel charges within the continental USA;<br />&bull; One (1) preventative maintenance inspection per Service Agreement year;<br />&bull; All covered replacement parts, except consumable items;<br />&bull; Applications Support and Software updates when available;<br />&bull; Factory trained Field Service Representatives.<br />&bull; No Charge on all Labor and Covered Parts.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the Business Size Standard is $19.0M Per Annum. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-59 (May 10, 2012).</p>

<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), Laboratory of Molecular Imaging and Nanomedicine (LOMIN), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract, for the Vevo LAZR Photoacoustic Imaging Solution to VisualSonics, Inc. 3080 Yonge Street Suite 6100 Toronto, Ontario, M4N3N1, CAN, , under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. <br />This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58. <br /><br />The corresponding NAICS code is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 Employees. <br /><br />The basis for sole source determination: is based upon the fact that the photoacoustic equipment (VisualSonics Vevo LAZR) is the only commercial source for integrated photoacoustics (integrated photoacoustics is photoacoustic data spatially coregistered with acoustic (ultrasound) data). Combining ultrasound (structural information) and photoacoustics (molecular information) allows for the interpretation of the signal with anatomical context. In addition, the Vevo LAZR will interface with existing NIH owned equipment. Due to technical considerations- and proprietary components (hardware and software), it is not possible to integrate any other photoacoustic capability with the existing NIH equipment, furthermore, such equipment is not offered by any other commercial source.<br />&nbsp;<br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Morphix Technologies, 2557 Production Road, Virginia Beach, VA 23454. The USCG has an immediate need to procure a sensitive, selective, durable, lightweight customized kit of eight (8) chemical detector cassettes that provide an immediate visual indication of the presence of a chemical hazard without the need for a liquid sample. It enables the war-fighter and first responder to visually monitor, in real time, the presence of hazardous chemicals simultaneously. The cassettes must be compatible with the Chameleon Chemical armband produced by Morphix Technologies.</p>
<p>Morphix Technologies is the only manufacturer that is capable of producing an acceptable maritime chemical detection system for the U.S. Coast Guard that has been tested and verified by an independent US Government laboratory. Testing and verification requires the detection cassettes to be fully capable to be worn for an extended period of time in an operational environment (land and maritime), diverse weather climates/environments and be submerged in salt/fresh water for extended periods. The Department of Defense has completed its verification of the Morphix Technologies detection cassettes for the intended operational environment. Additionally, the USCG has completed extended operational evaluations during its 13 month WMD response test and evaluation program. As a result of this verification process, the lightweight chemical detectors have been approved for use by the USCG in a maritime environment that contains chemical agents.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, if your firm currently has a certified product in accordance with the requirements stated herein, you may submit a proposal for consideration. If the proposal is received by 5:00 PM PST, Thursday, April 19, 2012 it will be considered by the agency.</p>

The intent of this acquisition is to procure non-developmental radio systems for our warfighters as well as federal, state and local agencies, and authorized foreign militaries.  The Government will make available to all qualified contractors the Government owned Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).   The contractor will take the SRW waveform and integrate it onto their hardware solution.  The contractor will then offer to the Government Radio Sets that meet or exceed the performance work statement (PWS) requirements that will be released with the Request for Proposal.   This acquisition will result in partially modernizing the tactical communications of the Army's Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs).<br><br>The radio systems (to include ancillary equipment such as installation kits, antennas...) being purchased under this acquisition will provide position location information (PLI) data and voice communications where they don't exist today in the BCT.  The radios will connect the "foxhole" to the brigade tactical operations centers (BDE TOC) and interoperate with radio systems in the BDE TOC that currently connect the brigade to the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T).  <br>The Government requirement will be for a single channel, vehicular mounted radio running the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) that fits into one half of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Combat Net Radio (CNR) vehicular mount. <br><br>The Government anticipates there will be a requirement for radios qualified for both SECRET and Tactical Unclassified Information (TUI). The offered radios shall be endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect user voice and data at either the NSA Type 1 or Type 2 level.  <br><br>This acquisition will be a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for a five year base award period.  The Government intends to make multiple awards under this solicitation to one or more offerors.   On an annual basis, the Government will review its technical requirements to determine if a new solicitation will be issued to allow additional offerors to submit proposals for considerations. <br> <br>The Government anticipates the initial contract award under this IDIQ will be 350 - 1,700 radios.  This award may go to one or more offerors.  During the next two years the remaining radios, up to 5,000, will be procured.   Awards after that are TBD. <br>The Government anticipates contract award end of August 2012 with first equipment deliveries starting in October 2012 and ending in February 2013.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA,  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate has a need to identify potential source capable of supplying the following: <br><br>Description of Instrument: A stand-alone unit for measuring the maximum bubble pressure in a system which may or may not also include the capability of attaining direct measurements of surface tension, interfacial tension and contact angles.<br><br>Other potential options are: (1) measurements of surface tension in the ranges of 10 ~100 mN/m in 10milliseconds to 10 seconds with the capability to sense the liquid surface and adjusts to the correct depth automatically; (2) measurement of short and also long measuring times; (3) correction for estimates of sample viscosity with unknown samples; (4) corrections for gravitational deformation of bubbles.<br> <br>General Description of Requirement, Measurement Principle: <br><br>(1) Bubble tensiometers (Or instruments utilizing the "maximum bubble pressure method") are used in research, development and quality control for characterization of water-based solutions such as surfactants, polymers, acids and bases. They measure:<br> <br>- dynamic surface tension<br>- bubble lifetime<br>- bubble deadtime<br>- hydrostatic pressure<br>- effective adsorption time<br><br>A capillary is immersed into the liquid sample and gas (air) is bubbled out of the capillary at a constant rate where the bubble radius is already known. Measurement principle: The pressure inside the capillary is measured. As the pressure increases in the capillary, a bubble is gradually pushed into the liquid and continues to increase until the maximum value is obtained when the bubble has the completely hemispherical shape whose radius is exactly corresponding to the radius of the capillary. Afterwards, the bubble quickly grows and leaves the capillary. The maximum pressure depends on the force exerted by the liquid, and hence its surface tension. These specialty instruments may also monitor bubble lifetime and deadtime, allowing more detailed investigation of liquid properties.<br><br>Figure 1 (Change of pressure during bubble formation plotted as a function of time) shows each step of bubble formation and corresponding change of bubble radius and each step is described below:<br> <br>Source: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_bubble_pressure_method><br><br>Figure 1 Notations and Definitions:<br><br>A, B: A bubble appears on the end of the capillary. As the size increases, the radius of curvature of the bubble decreases.<br><br>C: At the point of the maximum bubble pressure, the bubble has a complete hemispherical shape whose radius is identical to the radius of the capillary denoted by Rcap. The surface tension can be determined using the Laplace equation in the reduced form for spherical bubble shape within the liquid.<br><br> <br><br>D, E: After the maximum pressure, the pressure of the bubble decreases and the radius of the bubble increases until the bubble is detached from the end of a capillary and a new cycle begins. This is not relevant to determine the surface tension.<br><br>(2) Optical tensiometers (also known as goniometers or contact angle meters) allow direct measurements of surface tension, interfacial tension and contact angles. Optical tensiometry is an extremely versatile technique used for characterization of both liquids and solids. Applications range from developing engineered surfaces and technical liquids to controlling the purity of semiconductors.<br><br>Measuring surface tension, interfacial tension or contact angles provides information on material properties such as wettability, absorption, surface free energy, adsorption, spreading, cleanliness, surface heterogeneity and interfacial rheology.  A drop is produced and the profile is then captured using a goniometer/tensiometer. The software then analyses the profile of the drop and makes a series of calculations. With pendant drops, in older, more obsolete software, the maximum diameter and the ratio between this parameter and the diameter at the distance of the maximum diameter from the drop apex is evaluated and formulas are used to derive on the basis of the Young-Laplace equation surface tension. In more current, more accurate software, the LaPlace equation itself is used to calculate surface tension for hundreds of pairs of data points along the profile of the drop. Sophisticated software routines automate this computationally intensive process.<br><br>These properties are of great interest when studying and developing engineered surfaces and technical liquids and for controlling solid surface and liquid quality.<br><br>Marketplace: Currently developed and commercialized tensiometers monitors the pressure needed to form a bubble, the pressure difference between inside and outside the bubble, the radius of the bubble, and the surface tension of the sample are calculated in one time and a data acquisition is carried out via computer software control. Goniometers of varying capabilities are also readily available in the marketplace.<br><br><br>Point of Contact (P.O.C.): <br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Stephanie.A.Marcott.Civ@Mail.Mil mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on May 22, 2012.<br><br><br>Stephanie A.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA,  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate has a need to identify potential source capable of supplying the following: <br><br>Description of Instrument: <br><br>Instruments: 3 to 18 angle static light scattering instrument for the measurement of absolute molecular weight, size, and conformation of macromolecules and particles in solution. Options may or may not include:  (1) allowing both multiple-angle dynamic light scattering and static light scattering experiments; (2) instruments having photomultiplier tube and standard cross-correlator detectors; (3) instrument operation at 632.8, 514.5, and 488.0 nm laser lines.<br><br>General Description of Requirement: <br><br>Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS) Instrumentation [also known as Static Light Scattering (SLS), Classical Light Scattering or Differential Light Scattering].<br><br>Static light scattering is a technique in physical chemistry that measures the intensity of the scattered light to obtain the average molecular weight of a macromolecule like a polymer or a protein. <br><br>For static light scattering experiments, a high intensity monochromatic light, usually a laser, is launched in a solution containing the macromolecules. One or many detectors are used to measure the scattering intensity at one or many angles.<br><br>In order to measure the weight average molecular weight directly, without calibration, from the light scattering intensity, the laser intensity, the quantum efficiency of the detector and the full scattering volume and solid angle of the detector needs to be known. Since this is impractical, all commercial instruments are calibrated using a strong, known scatterer like toluene since the Rayleigh Ratio of toluene and a few other solvents were measured using an absolute light scattering instrument.<br><br>Data Analyses:<br><br>(1) Guinier plot. The scattered intensity can be plotted as a function of the angle to give information on the Rg which can simply be calculated using the Guinier approximation as follows:<br><br> <br><br>where ln( R( )) = lnP( ) also known as the form factor with q = 4 n0sin( /2)/ . Hence a plot of the corrected Rayleigh ratio,  R( ) vs sin2( /2) or q2 will yield a slope Rg2/3. However, this approximation is only true for qRg < 1. Note that for a Guinier plot, the value of dn/dc and the concentration is not needed.<br><br>(2) Kratky plot. The Kratky plot is typically used to analyze the conformation of proteins, but can be used to analyze the random walk model of polymers. A Kratky plot can be made by plotting sin2( /2) R( ) vs sin( /2) or q2 R( ) vs q.<br><br>(3) Debye plot. Theoretical Zimm Plot showing the double extrapolation to Mw, the bright green pointThis method is used to derive the molecular mass and 2nd virial coefficient, A2, of the polymer or polymer complex system. The difference to the Zimm plot is that the experiments are performed using a single angle. Since only one angle is used (typically 90 ), the Rg cannot be determined as can be seen from the following equation:<br><br> <br><br>(4) Zimm plot. For polymers and polymer complexes which are of a monodisperse nature () as determined by dynamic light scattering, a Zimm plot is a conventional means of deriving the parameters such as Rg, molecular mass Mw and the second virial coefficient A2.<br><br>One must note that if the material constant K defined above is not implemented, a Zimm plot will only yield Rg. Hence implementing K will yield the following equation:<br><br> <br><br>Experiments are performed at several angles and at least 4 concentrations. Performing a Zimm analysis on a single concentration is known as a partial Zimm analysis and is only valid for dilute solutions of strong point scatterers. The partial Zimm however, does not yield the second virial coefficient, due to the absence of the variable concentration of the sample.<br><br>Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_light_scattering<br><br>Marketplace: Several commercial companies offer equipment with a variety of options.<br><br>Point of Contact (P.O.C.): <br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Stephanie.A.Marcott.Civ@Mail.Mil mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on May 22, 2012.<br><br>Stephanie A.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10 MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of the RFI. In addition, contractors responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information. The information collected through this process is considered to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002.</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking capable sources to construct and implement a program to enhance the emergency preparedness knowledge, awareness and practical application of Incident Command System (ICS) and National Incident Management System (NIMS) among its personnel.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Incident Management System (NIMS) provides a consistent nationwide template to enable Federal, State, tribal and local governments, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations to work together to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity in order to reduce the loss of life and property and harm to the environment. All federal agencies are directed under HSPD-5 to be NIMS compliant. The Incident Command System (ICS) is the established, standardized organizational structure and terminology utilized for the management of all incidents.</p>
<p>NIMS was developed so responders from different jurisdictions and disciplines can work together better to respond to natural disasters and emergencies, including acts of terrorism. NIMS benefits include a unified approach to incident management; standard command and management structures; and emphasis on preparedness, mutual aid and resource management. Additional information is available at: http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/index.shtm</p>
<p>In August 2009, FDA established a National Incident Management System (NIMS) Implementation Working Group with representation from Agency Centers, ORA and Offices to review Agency emergency response operations and training. Responsibilities of the NIMS Implementation Working Group regarding training activities include:</p>
<p>&bull; Ensuring personnel are trained and prepared to function in a unified command system to manage the response to incidents, including outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensuring that ICS training requirements are based on the established standards for incident management, the FDA Emergency Operations Plan, and other guiding documents. The training program is to be aligned with the NIMS credentialing guidelines and establish training requirements that are based on position duties and competencies.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), Management of Domestic Incidents requires all Federal Departments and agencies to adopt the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and use it in their individual domestic incident management, emergency prevention, preparedness, and response, recovery, and mitigation activities. FDA, other federal agencies as well as States receiving federal funding for homeland security initiatives are also required to implement NIMS principles such as Incident Command Structure (ICS) in their emergency response protocols, as well as in support of all actions taken to assist State or local entities during an emergency.</p>
<p>NIMS enhances the management of domestic incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive system for incident management, based on ICS and strengthens FDA's capability and resolve to fulfill it responsibilities to the American people in times of emergency.</p>
<p>The Office of Crisis Management (OCM) serves as the FDA's focal point for coordinating emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA regulated products or in situations when FDA regulated products need to be utilized or deployed. It coordinates intra-agency and inter-agency activities related to crisis management, emergency preparedness and response, and security operations. OCM has the responsibility for ensuring NIMS is being implemented throughout the FDA and proposing training for emergency preparedness and response activities.</p>
<p>The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) is one of the FDA's specialized program centers. ORA works to achieve compliance of regulated products through inspection, investigates outbreaks involving regulated products and responds to emergencies affecting the public health.</p>
<p>The Division of Human Resource Development (DHRD) a clearinghouse where FDA, State and local regulators can obtain training in various program areas. DHRD collaborates with its stakeholders: ORA field and headquarters, FDA Centers, states, academia and professional organizations to meet these training needs.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE</p>
<p>This notice seeks the services of sources knowledgeable of ICS and in the implementation of NIMS to provide FDA with FEMA sanctioned training that is needed in order to respond along with other federal agencies under unified or multi-agency command during public health emergencies.</p>
<p>Sources should have knowledge and experience with the implementation, development and training of ICS.</p>
<p><br />The program may include, but shall not be limited, to the following tasks.</p>
<p>A. NIMS development, recommendation and evaluation regarding NIMS implementation should include, but shall not be limited to the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Identify any recommendations regarding credentialing or certification of personnel.</p>

<p>3. Identify and recommend training and exercises for other agency personnel</p>
<p>4. Identify and assess FDA current plans, procedures and policies for emergency response</p>
<p>5. Assess whether those plans, procedures and policies are NIMS-compliant</p>
<p>6. Provide recommendations for the development of new or modifications to existing plans, procedures and policies to assure NIMS compliance.</p>
<p>7. Recommend appropriate training for NIMS implementation throughout FDA.</p>
<p>8. Upon request, by Office of Crisis Management, evaluate selected FDA incident management activities and/or exercises</p>
<p>9. Upon request, by Office of Crisis Management, facilitate in person meeting(s) to discuss &lsquo;lessons learned' from an incident or exercise</p>

<CONTACT>Office of Systems Development, NESDIS, Email nesdis.data.recovery.rfi@noaa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information for Satellite Uplink and Data Recovery Services<br />
<p><strong><br />I. CAPABILITIES SOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify interested parties capable of providing commercial solutions to meet NOAA operational satellite uplink and data recovery services needs. The primary areas of interest include:</p>
<p>-Low Earth Orbit multi-satellite data recovery,<br />-Low Earth Orbit multi-satellite commanding,<br />-Near real-time data distribution,<br />-Secure, highly reliable communications, and<br />-End-to-end low data latency to multiple data processing centers.</p>
<p>All information provided by the U.S. Government is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a requirement unless specifically stated in a follow-on solicitation. This information request is for planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p><strong>II. SPECIFIC NEEDS</strong></p>
<p>Operational service must provide:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Recovery Support</span>: Reception of CCSDS data at a downlink frequency of 2258 MHz (TBR) and a data rate of 2 Mbps and 32 kbps from a compliment of world-wide locations to be determined by the service provider*</p>
<p>-Government supplied satellite data quantity is not greater than 60 Mbytes per orbit for each of 6 equally spaced satellites.</p>
<p>-Satellites will be in a 520 Km circular orbit inclined at 24 degrees.</p>
<p>-Satellites will be programmed to downlink data at 10 degrees above the station horizon.</p>
<p>-Data playback will be First-In-First-Out (FIFO).</p>
<p>-Each receive system shall have a G/T of no less than 13 dB/K at 10 degrees elevation. Performance down to 5 degrees elevation (when unobstructed) is desirable.</p>
<p>-The ground stations must utilize a CORTEX interface for command processing and real-time telemetry reception.</p>
<p>-The ground antennas shall be capable of automatic 5 minute turn around between satellite passes without loss of downlink data. Satellite orbit information (TLE's) will be provided if required. BPSK modulation, RHCP polarization and NRZ-M data format will be used in the uplink and the downlink.</p>
<p>-The ground stations must have adequate storage capability to store data on site for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>* One site is already known, that being a site in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan. The service provider will not be responsible for this site, but should figure it into their response as available to receive data from every satellite, every visible pass.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communications and Data Distribution</span>: Current legacy ground stations utilize a broadband connection to the internet via VPN and Secure FTP capability. Upon receipt and file creation by the Contractor, data files need to be transmitted in near real time to at least four processing centers, two in US and two in Taiwan in compliance with ISO/IEC 27001, "Information Security Management Systems - Requirements".</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance</span>: Data latency is a key performance metric. The time from data collection by the satellite to data receipt at the processing centers needs to be no more than 40 minutes on a daily average basis. Interested parties should assume each satellite collects data uniformly throughout its orbit. An Operational Availability of no less than 98% (TBR) must be met on an annual basis (from data reception to data delivery).<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uplink support</span>: At least one receive site shall also be able to support real-time uplink of commands at 32 Kbps that are forwarded from the satellite operations center in Taiwan. The Government currently expects real-time connectivity to the Taiwan operations center to be via VPN over the internet. The command site(s) should be a compliment to the Taiwan site at Hsin-Chu in that they would provide commanding opportunities on satellite orbits not seen by the Taiwan site. Uplink frequency must be 2042.8 MHz (TBR). Uplink EIRP must be 48 dBWi.</p>
<p><strong>III. INFORMATION SOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>Vendors are invited to submit a data package to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:nesdis.data.recovery.rfi@noaa.gov">nesdis.data.recovery.rfi@noaa.gov</a> or by mail to:<br /><br />E/OSD<br />Office 6218-A<br />NOAA/NESDIS/OSD<br />1335 East West Hwy, Building SSMC1<br />Silver Spring, MD 20910</p>
<p>Data packages are due by June 15, 2012, and should describe the vendor's specific capabilities to fulfill the USG operational data services needs described above. The data package should include the following types of data:</p>
<p>1. Corporate (or team) capabilities and relationships that directly apply to meeting the requirements.<br />2. Pricing model for the expected commercial services<br />3. Existing capabilities that address the requirements or that could be modified to include relevant services<br />4. Ground site locations (Lat/Lon) - identify as existing or proposed.

THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley engineers have developed a new software package for more facilecomputational fluid dynamics. The softwares fast user run time, robustness, andefficiency have enabled its extensive use in space shuttle modeling. Adaptive RefinementTool (ART) permits the computational modeling of flow, including jet or rocket plumes,wakes, and shocks via unstructured tetrahedral grids. Commercially available softwarepackages often struggle to sufficiently and quickly model such complex examples of flow.ART also allows cells to be divided into two, four, or eight cells as compared totraditional software, which allows cell division only in units of eight. This isadvantageous as it allows the user to control cell division more succinctly. ART executescommand via colloquial English and has built-in internal statistical programming thatincreases its ease of use. ART allows the user the choice of alternate variables such astemperature or pressure at will, which facilitates modeling unusual or unlikelyoccurrences.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate thedate and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information.RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses areprovided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO forthe purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conductingpreliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for futurelicensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO willfollow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  Nofollow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a novel spectral analysis system that providesrapid multi-spectral analysis and imaging, in a miniaturized system design. Typicalspectrometers make use of linear gratings with linear slits or charge-coupled device(CCD) arrays to separate and detect light in its component wavelengths to build aspectrum across a range of wavelengths.Such conventional spectrometers are difficult to miniaturize below a few centimeters.Creating an image with these systems also requires physical rastering of the light beamand detection system across an area to build up the individual data points of an image.The NASA Micro-Ring Thin-Film Spectrometer technology makes use of a micro-ring gratingto separate the component wavelengths of the light signal for detection and spectralanalysis. Due to the miniaturized design obtained by Fresnel diffraction, an array ofthese micro-ring grating-based spectrometers can be constructed to enable extremelysmall-size multi-spectral imaging of an analysis area.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<a href="mailto:angela.l.karten@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>SEEKING INDUSTRY INFORMATION ON CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES<br>	<br>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) in partnership with White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) is conducting Market Research to seek industry information on available capabilities, products and technologies for developing and fielding an H.264 Fidelity Range Extensions software library and codec.  The intent of this effort is to be able to field a real-time, low latency high bit depth (14-bit) compression codec to support live streaming requirements at Department of Defense (DoD) Test Ranges.  This capability is also of significant interest to other areas within the DoD.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION<br><br>This capability will be used to support real-time and post-test operations for DoD weapons testing at the nation's Test and Evaluation (T&E) Ranges.  Responses shall address available capabilities to efficiently generate an optimized H.264 FRExt software library and codec that will be leveraged as a Government Open Source product.  <br><br>1.  Background:  The overall objective of this task is to generate a cross platform compatible software library that is capable of compressing and decompressing Test Range 14-bit motion imagery in real-time with a full system (glass-to-glass) latency of less than 200 milliseconds.  The compression modes shall support both lossy and lossless modes of operation and support both monochrome and color imagery.  Upon completion of the project, the software (source code, project files, binaries, compiled codecs, etc.) and documentation are to be posted to an open source repository site that is acceptable to the DoD, to support open source sharing with other T&E and DoD efforts and users.  As part of this effort, special attention will be made to ensure that the resulting software capability is compliant with applicable Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) standards, recommended practices and engineering guidelines.  As a deliverable, the codec shall have the ability to encode and decode imagery in the formats requested.<br><br>2.  Desired Capabilities:  The desire to implement high bit depth image compression is derived from the benefits that can be achieved with high dynamic range imaging in the weapons testing environment.  For instance, science grade infrared cameras commonly used at the Test Ranges provide raw 14-bit monochrome dynamic range.  Currently, this imagery is required to be scaled to 8-bits before it can be used with live streaming systems and for delivery to customers in standard compressed file formats.  14-bit visible color cameras are also currently in use that are handicapped with this same issue.  The desire is to be able to support bit depths ranging from 8 bits to 14 bits in both monochrome and color modes, including 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0 and 4:0:0.  The H.264 High 4:4:4 Predictive and Intra Profiles define the specific details.  Reference Figure 1: Example of high dynamic range imaging, included as Attachment 1.<br><br>3.  H.264 FRExt Software Library and Codec Performance Requirements:  Key characteristics for the H.264 FRExt software library and codec performance are contained in Table 2.1, included as Attachment 2.  Major activities that will be carried out under the effort include:<br><br>--- a.  Requirements definition.  The main objective of this task is to create a capability for compressing and decompressing T&E community motion imagery with a dynamic range of up to 14-bits.  Specifically, a key goal is the low latency (<200 msec) real-time (30 Hz) high definition compression of Range infrared and high bit depth visible motion imagery.  Performance requirements are required with Intra (I frame only) and an Intra Predictive Predictive (IPP) Group of Pictures (GOP) structure with up to eight P frames for every I frame.<br>--- b.  Build software codec configuration files.<br>--- c.  Optimize the configuration files for quality and speed performance.<br>--- d.  Optimize for both monochrome and color high dynamic range imagery.<br>--- e.  Optimize the H.264 codec for both software only encoding and decoding.<br>--- f.  Provide documentation on the capability.<br>--- g.  Post as open source project on a DoD approved site.<br><br>4.  Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/MISB Standard:  The following Government resources and standard will be made available to support this requirement if/when the Government decides to pursue this effort.<br><br>--- a.  Existing stored samples of 14-bit 4:0:0 monochrome infrared imagery.<br>--- b.  Existing stored samples of 14-bit 4:4:4 color visible imagery.<br>--- c.  MISB Standard 0404: Compression for Infrared Motion Imagery.<br><br>5.  Testing and Result Comparisons:  Where possible, imagery in the near, mid-wave and long wave infrared will be tested in this effort.  Images that have been previously captured with WSMR Range infrared and high speed, high bit depth color cameras will be made available for testing, optimizing and measuring the H.264 software.  Specific image sets with high dynamic range scene content will be tested to provide evidence of the value of the software capability over existing systems.  These image sets will be scaled to 8-bit images and compressed with H.264 baseline software to validate the quality improvement.  Both qualitative and quantitative measures are to be provided.  Standard peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics are to be measured on each data set to illuminate the quantitative enhancement.<br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH<br><br>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to improve the Government's understanding of the requirements and industry capabilities in order to establish the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  PM ITTS is looking for suppliers who can provide or develop a timely solution.  <br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED<br><br>Submissions:  Respondents are asked to submit replies no later than 15:30 PM Eastern Time, Orlando, FL, on Wednesday, 30 May 2012 by email to angela.l.karten@us.army.mil with a courtesy copy to nicole.bui@us.army.mil, or alternatively by mail to:  U.S. Army PEO STRI - Acquisition Center, ATTN:  SFAE-STRI-KOT/Angela Karten, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.

<a href="mailto:fargenziano@usgs.gov">fargenziano@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to participate within the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ocean research program at The University of Rhode Island (URI).  Benefits include use of UNOLS research vessels and equipment, use of URI, Graduate School of Oceanography facilities, a forum for collaboration between academia and science-based Federal agencies, and advice, planning, facilitation and resultant reports from UNOLS.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to URI unless it is contacted by any vendor that believes it possesses similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Frank J. Argenziano (fargenziano@usgs.gov) no later than 12 p.m. ET, May 21, 2012 with an affirmative answer.
The USGS considers employee signatures to be personal protected information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted.  By posting this document, the Contract Specialist attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 13.1)
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractors unique qualifications:
UNOLS is the only organization that coordinates the use of federally supported oceanographic facilities with academic oceanographic institutions, and it is the only organization where the ocean research and education community, research facility operators, and supporting Federal agencies work cooperatively to improve access, scheduling, operation, and capabilities of current and future academic oceanographic facilities.  The UNOLS fleet will greatly aid in the research necessary to meet our mission.  As stated in the Program Strategy, the USGS is developing an integrated coastal program that effectively applies the breadth of USGS expertise towards the objective of providing national and regional capabilities to characterize coastal systems and to measure, analyze, understand, and forecast coastal changes (natural and anthropogenic) that affect coastal economies, resource availability, recreational quality, and the integrity and sustainability of the Nations coastal ecosystems.
Market research was conducted via the internet in early April, 2012.  Other organizations found . . . did not provide the same diversity and scope as UNOLS, nor the specific areas of research necessary to meet USGS minimum scientific needs, such as microbial oceanography, biogeochemical processes and national sea level monitoring.  Moreover, UNOLS has experience working with Federal agencies that these other organizations do not, as doing so is expressly included within UNOLS mission statement.  Also, no other organization has a fleet of research vessels that can compare to UNOLS.  The UNOLS fleet is the largest and most capable fleet of oceanographic research vessels in the world.  It was determined that no other U.S. organization or consortium can provide the scope of oceanographic vessels, research, and support capabilities necessary to satisfy USGS objectives.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a cost-plus-fixed-fee award, on a sole source basis.  This non-competitive requirement is for attaining operational status within safety parameters of a laboratory glovebox, built for the US Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (MRICD) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland.  The completed service award will include a one year limited warranty on parts and labor on the STERIS mVHP system and other components, not including consumables.  Issuance of an award is planned to Strategic Technology Enterprises, Inc. (STE), a subsidiary of STERIS Corporation, 5960 Heisler Road, Mentor, OH.  <br><br>MRICD, in consultation with the contracting officer, has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only STE reasonably available to complete the services required.  This is a follow-on requirement to a previously built glovebox with integrated decontamination system.  The STERIS method of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia vapor decontamination has been proven effective in the destruction of chemical warfare agents but integration of this system with a multi-workstation glovebox involves significant technical challenges that STE has pre-existing knowledge and capability to address without duplication of costs.  Services to be performed are not commercial in nature due to the specific MRICD requirements of performance.  Without STE services, the glovebox will not be fully operational with its integrated decontamination system.  Specific research projects may not be undertaken until operational status is in full compliance with safety parameters.<br><br>This is a notice of intent to award on a non-competitive basis.  This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation is forthcoming as the exception at FAR 5.202(a)(13) is applicable to this requirement.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A justification and approval document will be posted after award issuance to STE.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to issue an award for services described herein.  <br><br>Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than May 29, 2012 by 12:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time to:  Scot Plank, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at scot.b.plank@amedd.army.mil. Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder MRICD laboratory operations.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.<br>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Solicitation Number FA8109-12-R-0003 <br />At this time it is not the Government's intent to request competitive proposals for this acquisiiton. The Government intends to award a sole source contract to BAE Systems to accomplish an Enterprise-Wide Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materials Shortages (DMSMS) Predictive Tool Capability. This requirement is in support of the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) obsolescence management initiatives. The Predictive Tool Capability provided through this acquisition is to assist the Air Force (AF) community in determining the present and future state of program managed system's Bill of Material (BOM), identified items status, and their life cycle procurement efforts. Additionally, the requirement will consist of the loading and maintenance of the BOM, to ensure an accurate source of data and analysis exists, to assist the Program Managers with evaluating potential supportability risk due to the discontinuation of material or loss of suppliers. The contractor shall also provide engineering and technical services for the effort, to include activities which enhance the DMSMS process in the following areas:<br />1) Loading of BOM data<br />2) Maintaining BOM data<br />3) Loading FMS BOM data (country specific)<br />4) Data Reports<br />5) System Use Training<br />6) Other direct Cost<br />7) Travel
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" due to the fact the Government does not have all the data. The Government is investigating data rights to allow for possible future competition.</p>
<p>This requirement will not be set-aside for small business and will be covered under NAICS code 518210. The anticipated contract will have a performance period of 24 months, with a one year base period and a one year option. The approximate Request for Proposal (RFP) issued date is 29 May 2012. The anticipated award date is on or before 31 July 2012.</p>
<p>The cognizant Contracting Office address is 848 SCMG/PKAC, 3001 Staff Dr, Suite 1AB1 100A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3015. The POC for this effort is Anthony Johnson, anthony.johnson@tinker.af.mil.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services.  The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support.   The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03.   In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems.  This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).  The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements:  Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED).  Emerging requirements for which SETA support would be required include Integrated Ground Security Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C); Tactical Security System (TSS); and Tunneling Detection. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) in which Task Orders may be issued and will be for a one  year base period, a first option period of one year and a second option period of three months.  The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders.  The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.  NAICS Code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.  Proposals shall be due no later than 2:00 pm on 2 March 2012.  Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Phylis Ross at phylis.g.ross @us.army.mil.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Specifications:<br />The purchase request is for a new microfiche scanner for OIEI to convert microfiche data to electronic images. OIEI has 7000-1 Mine Accident, Injury and Illness Reports, Return-To-Work Reports, and 7000-2 Quarterly Employment and Coal Production reports for 1980-2003 contained on microfiche. The microfiche data is difficult and time consuming to search when information requests are received. Electronic images converted by the scanner will be imported into the document management system, which will facilitate searching. The scanner must meet:<br />&bull; Fast, high performance 16/35mm microfiche scanner<br />&bull; 100-600 dpi true optical resolution<br />&bull; Up to 200 pages per minute<br />&bull; Fully automated and/or manual loading capabilities<br />&bull; Up 60 75 fiche at a time within the input hopper<br />&bull; Single pass intelligent prescan<br />&bull; Grayscale, bitonal or dual output<br />&bull; Automatic gain control to optimize image quality on the fly<br />&bull; Quantum Scan Strip Scanning Software/Quantum Process QA Software</p>
<p>Additionally, the scanner must be capable of scanning a full microfiche film containing up to 70 images per film in a single pass. Following a pre-scan, the software shall provide an indication of the boundaries between images, and give the scan operator the opportunity to adjust the boundaries as necessary. The software shall also make an initial determination of the enhancements necessary to provide a readable image, and allow the scan operator to adjust as necessary. Output from each scanned microfiche film will be up to 70 Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)-Group 4 CCITT files that can be used in MSHA's OpenText DM document management system. Each image produced by the scanner must be of sufficient quality that specific data elements in the image such as the date, mine ID number or contractor ID number can be recognized using Cardiff Teleform version 10.x software, and used for indexing in the document management system.</p>
<p>Finally, the hardware manufacturer must provide professional services including guidance and issue resolution for exception processing. For example, help process images that were filmed with poor quality or that are different than the majority of MSHA's filmed images. Additionally, professional services will include remote assistance as problems arise. Professional services must also include initial setup and configuration of MSHA's film types and also to provide training specific to these defined types.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Adherence to Product Specification <br />ii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract based on the Offeror whose quote, conforming to the specifications named in the Product Specification, will be the lowest price technically acceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Adherence to Product Specification). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p><br />EVALUATION SUMMARY:</p>
<p>FACTOR I. - ADHERENCE TO PRODUCT SPECIFICATION-The Offeror shall submit evidence that acknowledges the features and tasks identified in the Product Specification to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of delivering the required items and performing the work. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the information outlined in the Product Specification.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price. The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your proposal.</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL RATINGS:<br />Quotes will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Adherence to Product Specification follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Factor I- Adherence to Product Specification will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Acceptable-The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes strengths which significantly outweigh the weaknesses. The risk of unsuccessful performance is at least moderate, as the proposal solutions are feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Unacceptable- The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous weaknesses which outweigh the strengths. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on May 23, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Responsible quoters shall provide pricing for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity (1) Job. The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, travel and services necessary to conduct measure the visibility of a forklift, in accordance with the following statement of work:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) develops, advances and deploys measurement science and standards to speed development, adoption, and integration of leading-edge intelligent technologies to advance U.S. manufacturing performance.</p>
<p>Within ISD, the Next Generation Robotics and Automation Program addresses the measurement science and standards necessary to enable the next generation of smart robots and automation systems and to ensure their adoption in manufacturing in the U.S. at scales ranging from the very small to the very large. The Program addresses major barriers including perception, manipulation, human-robot interaction, and safety. It does so through targeted projects that develop standards and performance measures that will help drive research and spur development and applications of intelligent automation that can operate in real world manufacturing and in close proximity with people.</p>
<p>Forklifts are readily used in manufacturing and near people. However, lack of operator visibility for forklift drivers is a critical issue requiring improved forklift designs and/or augmented imaging systems that can provide visibility for blind spots to operators. Current measurement of visibility is crude using light to cast shadows on test boards and count the dark squares. Therefore, improved measurement technology and methods are required to improve forklifts.</p>
<p>TASKS<br />The Contractor shall use advanced measurement technology to measure the non-visible operator regions of a forklift similar to current standards, to analyze the results and provide an initial design for an automated method for measuring visibility.<br /><br />1. The Contractor shall measure the visibility of a forklift in accordance with tests outlined in the ANSI/ITSDF B56.11.6 - 2005, Evaluation of Visibility from Powered Industrial Trucks; Downloadable from http://www.itsdf.org/pB56.asp); and Attachment I, entitled "Measurement and Evaluation of Visibility Experiments for Powered Industrial Vehicles," NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) #7837, December 2011, using only advanced sensor system(s) (i.e., high definition laser scanner, surveyor, geospatial measurement device and/or 3D imager) detailed as:</p>
<p>a. Temporarily mount/clamp the manually-moveable, as specified in the standards and NISTIR, advanced sensor system to a NIST-owned forklift. Mounting shall allow <br />advanced sensor system rotation and sliding capability to simulate the forklift operator head motion throughout the average (standard specified) volume. NIST will provide a <br />Clark GPX 50 forklift, or equivalent for the purpose of work under the resultant purchase order. Work with the forklift must be performed on-site at NIST;<br /><br />b. Collect and analyze the measured data showing graphically and analytically the results of operator visibility for the forklift;</p>
<p>c. Findings shall report on operator visibility showing forklift obstructions as compared to the current standard criteria of all standard ANSI B56.11.6 and ISO/FDIS 13564-<br />1 tests discussed in NISTIR #7837 for powered industrial vehicles.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor shall provide a final report of results of the operator visibility of a manned forklift, according to the eleven tests listed in the above standards and NISTIR, using advanced optical measurement technology as compared to current standard methods. The report must also provide recommendations of the need for advanced measurement techniques for powered industrial vehicles over current standard light shadow methods.</p>
<p>Two printed copies of the detailed final report shall be submitted in full color and electronically; Raw 3D data point clouds and models of the tests performed shall be provided with the report on storage media such as CD's, DVD's, hard drive or other file-sharing medium;<br /><br />3. The Contractor shall provide an initial design for an automated visibility measurement system for powered industrial vehicles. The format shall include 2D and 3D strawman or concept CAD drawings, block diagrams of control system designs, discussion of system setup and use including estimated time for each, explanation of how the system will meet ANSI B56.11.6 and ISO/FDIS 13564-1 (discussed in NISTIR #7837) tests and a description of how the system data will be computed, analyzed and displayed in the standard specified report.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance shall be from the date of award through August 30, 2012.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />Work shall be performed at the Contractor's site and on-site at NIST. Work on-site at NIST shall take place during regular business hours.

<DESC><p>In most operational situations, NATO is responsible for a variety of security related duties.&nbsp; Conducting Operations Assessment in these operations may involve dealing with local institutions such as local governments and tribal structures, or with the local populations.&nbsp; NATO may wish to determine how local security force capacity is being developed, or how local population consider the security situation in their areas. <br /><br />Local actors are defined as elected or non-elected civil servants at the regional or local government level, local authorities in general, village elders, tribal, cultural, and religious leaders, and host nation civil society representatives. <br /><br />Whilst the technical and organisational aspects of Operations Assessments are relatively well understood, there is little understanding of how local actors can support--or be supported by-- the process, other than being a passive provider of data.&nbsp; The new concept on Operations Assessment aims to examine these issues through three broad interrelated research questions:<br /><br />First - How does the act of conducting Operations Assessment affect local actors, and how might it be used to increase local ownership of NATO operations?<br />Second - How can involving local actors through participatory approaches improve the quality, sensitivity and cultural relevance of Operations Assessment?<br />Third - What practical mechanism might be implemented to involve local actors in the Operations Assessment process?</p>

<DESC>The Control and Optimization Labotories (COL) applies advanced control systems analysis and design, combined with the power of numerical optimization is necessary to improve the performance of current and future nonlinear dynamic systems.  the performance margins of complex nonlinear systems by the application of innovative techniques in optimal control theory  is investigated to determine where performance is limited, not by the physics of the system but by the inherent limitations of traditional feedback control systems, is also necessary.  Increasing performance margins not only improves the mission performance of these systems but has the potential to increase the margin of safety and thereby reduce the costs and hazards to operators.
  Areas of interest to the COL are:

	General solutions to the optimal reorientation of spacecraft under a variety of actuation schemes.    

	High-accuracy solutions to low-thrust problems orbit transfer problems and their generation in near real-time.

	Approaches for synthesizing a set of optimized command signals to estimate the system parameters of a complex, nonlinear, flexible spacecraft system.

	The application of advanced numerical optimization methods to the problem of generating rapid, collision-free path planned motions for multi-degree-of-freedom articulated robot systems.
	Variations on the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), specifically the applicability of weighting functions to the target cities intended to direct the algorithm to arrive at the optimal solution to the TSP.

	The combination of sensitivity analysis and covector mapping to facilitate a rapid and efficient approach to perform a parameter value-function analysis and thereby improve the design process.

Scope
The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Control & Optimization Laboratory at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has a requirement for contractual services to apply optimal control theory to advanced control systems analysis and design.

<p>(b) The preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, electronic communication, radio, television or video presentation designed to support or defeat the enactment of legislation before the Congress or any State or local legislature or legislative body, except in presentation to the Congress or any State or local legislature itself; or designed to support of defeat any proposed or pending regulation, administrative action, or order issued by the executive branch of any State or local government, except in presentation to the executive branch of any State or local government itself; or</p>
<p>(c) Payment of salary or expenses of the Contractor, or any agent acting for the Contractor, related to any activity designed to influence the enactment of legislation, appropriations regulation, administrative action, or Executive order proposed or pending before the Congress or any State government, State legislature or local legislature or legislative body, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships or participation by an agency or officer of a State, local or tribal government is policymaking and administrative processes within the executive branch of that government.</p>

<p>(End of clause)<br />352.231-70 SALARY RATE LIMITATION (MAR 2012)<br />(a) Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level II in effect on the date an expense is incurred.<br />(b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms "direct salary," "salary", and "institutional base salary", have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as "direct salary", in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to ear outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&amp;A] costs).<br />Note: The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with Federal funds.<br />(c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding.<br />(d) See the salaries and wages pay table on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The contractor shall include this clause in all sub-contracts awarded under this contract for supporting or performing the specified program and services. Accordingly, the contractor shall ensure that each of its employees, and any sub-contractor staff, is made aware of, understands, and complies with this policy.</p>

<DESC>This is the SOLICITATION for a contractor to provide a sensitive, selective, durable, lightweight customized kit of&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EIGHT (8)</span></strong> chemical detector cassettes that provide an immediate visual indication of the presence of a chemical hazard without the need for a liquid sample for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). The kit enables the war-fighter and first responder to visually monitor, in real time, the presence of hazardous chemicals simultaneously. The cassettes must be compatible with the Chameleon Chemical armband produced by Morphix Technologies. The solicitation is scheduled to close at 5 pm May 21, 2012 PST. <br />
<p><br />Morphix Technologies is the only manufacturer that is capable of producing an acceptable maritime chemical detection system for the U.S. Coast Guard that has been tested and verified by an independent US Government laboratory. Testing and verification requires the detection cassettes to be fully capable to be worn for an extended period of time in an operational environment (land and maritime), diverse weather climates/environments and be submerged in salt/fresh water for extended periods. The Department of Defense has completed its verification of the Morphix Technologies detection cassettes for the intended operational environment. Additionally, the USCG has completed extended operational evaluations during its 13 month WMD response test and evaluation program. As a result of this verification process, the lightweight chemical detectors have been approved for use by the USCG in a maritime environment that contains chemical agents.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as Other Than Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The NAICS code is 339999 and the size standard is 500 employees. Interested offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation on FedBizOpps.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI launched its Afghanistan program in July 2009 to address instability at the local level. The mission of OTI-Afghanistan is to improve stability in strategically selected locations by supporting formal and informal Afghan governance structures. Through the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) program, OTI seeks to: improve local perception of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) legitimacy; establish and/or strengthen the link amongst GIRoA, informal governance structures and the local population; and leverage and/or empower community based resiliencies to address sources of instability. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.</p>
<p>OTI-Afghanistan's program works to facilitate community consultation, encourage GIRoA transparency and public outreach, and build Afghan capacity through fast, flexible, and targeted projects. Project activities facilitate local government engagement with communities to address grievances and enhance GIRoA's legitimacy; rehabilitate infrastructure through creation of short-term employment opportunities for which GIRoA is responsible and receives credit; support civic education programs that strengthen the relationship between formal and traditional governance mechanisms; provide technical support to local GIRoA officials and community groups including public outreach and communications training, assessments, surveys, and subject-matter experts; and build GIRoA officials' capacity to design and implement public relations campaigns and community programming following military clearing operations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Field Program Manager (Sr. FPM) is a member of the OTI/Afghanistan Team, reports to the OTI Deputy Country Representative (DCR) or his/her designee, and is based in Afghanistan. This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance may be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI/Afghanistan team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI/Afghanistan program.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Senior FPM's principal responsibility is to support the OTI/Afghanistan team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI/Afghanistan program. The location for the position is typically at a regional platform, such as Kandahar Airfield or Bagram Airfield or in Kabul. Additionally, the Sr. FPM should expect regular travel for extended periods to Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) or the District Stabilization Teams (DSTs) housed in Forward Operating Bases established and maintained by U.S. or NATO/ISAF military forces.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Senior Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Senior Field Program Manager requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The OTI Senior Field Program Manager is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Senior Field Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The OTI Senior Field Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The OTI Senior Field Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI DCR or his/her designee, the OTI Senior Field Program Manager will:</p>

<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services.  The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support.   The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03.   In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems.  This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).  The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements:  Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED).  Emerging requirements for which SETA support would be required include Integrated Ground Security Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C); Tactical Security System (TSS); and Tunneling Detection. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) in which Task Orders may be issued and will be for a one  year base period, a first option period of one year and a second option period of three months.  The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders.  The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has a requirement for contractor support to perform an independent assessment of the various types of real-time data monitoring systems available for offshore oil and gas operations.  The assessment should focus on drilling and include a cost benefit analysis that would detail potential costs to industry, potential increases in safety performance, government resources needed for implementation, and necessary training for all parties involved.  The assessments will identify what automation systems are available or being developed, the potential they have to increase offshore drilling safety, and any negative impacts they have on operations.

<DESC>The Contract Appraiser shall conduct Market Surveys of Minimum Fee Rental Rates for eight of the Forest Service Regions as defined in this Schedule (Except for Alaska R-10). The results of the Market Surveys for the Regions shall be used in establishing the National Minimum Rental Fee for Special Use Permits. The Contract Appraiser shall provide recommendations based on the results towards establishing the National Minimum Fee. The National Minimum Fee shall be used in those instances where it is determined that the cost of obtaining an appraisal of an individual site, together with the expense of administering the Special Use authorization, would likely exceed the fees collected. The National Minimum Fee does not preclude appraisal. Should a Special Use Authorization holder request the rent be determined by appraisal rather than using the National Minimum Fee, they may be provided one at their expense. If the decision is made to complete an appraisal, the selection of the Contract Appraiser and the preparation of all appraisals shall be coordinated with USDA Forest Service appraisal staff.<br /><br />Amendment 1 adds clauses.&nbsp; Due Date for proposals is June 11, 2012 at 1:00pm EST.<br />Inquiries and all correspondence concerning this solicitation should be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer Sherry Stover at email sstover@fs.fed.us.

The contractor shall also be responsible for the care, installation and removal of any instruments and apparatus furnished by the Government for such trials.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-79 LIABILITY AND INSURANCE (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.<br />(b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor s control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantial all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.<br />(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein. <br />(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.<br />(e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.<br />(f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer. The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event.<br />(End of clause)<br />Prescription: Insert clause 1352.271-80, Title, in all solicitations and contracts for ship repair.

NOAA will deliver the vessel to the<br />Contractor's facility, and redelivery will also be at the Contractor's facility. The required performance<br />period for all work defined is 30 days.<br />4] Coordination of the work schedules will be the responsibility of the Contractor to avoid any delays or<br />disruptions in order to meet the performance period. The Contractor will provide all facilities, labor,<br />materials, tools, and services required to complete the work UNLESS exceptions are noted in the<br />specified tasks below.<br />5] Upon arrival at the Contractor's facility the contractor will accept full responsibility for the safety of<br />the vessel, including but not limited to fire protection, security patrols, water&#8208;tight integrity, protection<br />from adverse environmental conditions, etc. This responsibility will terminate only after all work<br />defined herein (or added during the work period) is complete, accepted by NOAA, and NOAA personnel<br />remove the vessel from the Contractor's facility.<br />6] NOAA employees and contractors may be working on board the vessel during the contract<br />performance period on a not to interfere basis. During this period it will be required that these<br />personnel have full access to the vessel during normal working hours.<br />7] If the vessel is hauled from the water, the Contractor will ensure that all machinery and equipment<br />used for that purpose is fully functional, suitable for the task, rated for loads at least 20% greater than<br />the maximum weight of the vessel, and operated by trained, competent personnel. The NOAA COTR will<br />provide a docking plan for the vessel if requested.<br />8] The government reserves the right to award some or all tasks defined herein, and to add tasks during<br />the work period so long as period of performance revisions, if any, are mutually agreed.<br />9] All work performed under this SOW (or added to it during the period of performance) will meet or<br />exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of<br />vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.<br />10] In the event defects or damage unrelated to the work tasks defined below are discovered, the<br />Contractor will submit a Condition Found Report (CFR) to the COTR. The CFR will define corrective<br />actions needed, the cost for that work (separated into labor, materials, services, and total), and the<br />impact to the performance period.<br />2<br />11] All welding required as part of the tasks defined below will be performed by welders certified by ABS<br />or USCG working in accordance with welding procedures approved by ABS or USCG. Copies of<br />certifications and procedures will be provided to the COTR before work commences.<br />B] SPECIFIC WORK TASKS<br />1] Haul, clean, block, store, and launch:<br />Remove the vessel from the water. Pressure&#8208;wash the entire hull from sheer line to keel removing all<br />dirt, grime, and marine growth. If the vessel is a catamaran, clean all surfaces within the tunnel.<br />Similarly, clean all fittings below waterline, including propulsor components, struts, stern tubes, rudders,<br />foils, fins, through&#8208;hulls, etc. If the vessel is fitted with waterjet propulsors, clean the interior of the jets.<br />Do not damage any existing anti&#8208;fouling paint unless further tasks in this SOW require its removal. Clean<br />transducers with a non&#8208;metallic brush, taking care to not mar the emitting surface in any way. Clean all<br />surfaces of all anodes with a wire brush unless they are to be replaced.<br />Block the vessel in a level attitude with the keel (or keels) 36" minimum off the ground. Inspect the hull,<br />coatings, and all attachments and report any damage or discrepancies to the COTR in writing. Provide<br />electrical power to the vessel suitable for its shore power system.<br />Upon completion of all work done on the hard, launch the vessel, inspect all compartments for leaks,<br />and secure it dockside. If dockside testing or underway trials are required after launch, provide prior<br />notification to the COTR so NOAA personnel can attend.<br />2] Underbody coating system:<br />Prepare and touch&#8208;up and flaws in the underbody coating system with the same coating as currently<br />applied. Manufacturer's procedures will be used in all cases. Color to match existing coatings. The<br />contractor will ensure that all the environmental conditions are within the manufacture's specified<br />parameters prior to starting application processes and for all coatings. A written "as&#8208;cleaned" condition<br />report shall be submitted to the COTR prior to painting.<br />3] Inspect all seacocks:<br />Open, actuate, and visually inspect all seacocks in the hull bottom and topsides. A written report shall<br />be submitted to the COTR detailing the location and condition of seacocks, and recommending any<br />corrective action required. Include quotes for all recommended repairs.<br />4] Modify multi&#8208;beam mount<br />Remove the upper portion of the multi&#8208;beam transducer housing, lowering the watertight side walls to a<br />position 4" above static full load waterline, and reconstitute the upper flange. Revise the brackets and<br />mounting tabs to allow the transducer to be removed while the vessel is waterborne without causing<br />flooding of the bilge. The modified transducer mounting plate will be installed with rubber grommets<br />and plastic sleeves to reduce transducer vibration and galvanically isolate fasteners. Install a welded<br />loop or eye on the inside of the transducer well, and install a 1/8" stainless steel cable safety lanyard to<br />the transducer mounting plate.<br />Note: Provide drawings of all proposed modification to the COTR prior to commencing work.<br />Reinstall the transducer. Upon launch test transducer operation at speeds up to 8 knots to prove<br />adequate function. Run the vessel to maximum speed with the transducer shutdown to prove no<br />excessive vibrations or noise is generated.<br />3<br />5] Service waterjets<br />Replace all internal and external anodes on both jets. Replace the water seals, oil seals, thrust bearings,<br />and seal sleeves in both jets. Replace the steering cranks on both jets. This work will include the<br />replacement of associated nylon locking fasteners, gaskets, and O&#8208;rings as required. Upon launching of<br />the vessel, test both jets at all speeds and throughout their maneuvering range to demonstrate full<br />function.<br />6] Realign P&amp;S engines<br />Realign the main engines to the waterjets by shifting their position in the hull. If required, revise the<br />engine bearers and/or vibration mount bolting holes to retain full strength and support. The clutch<br />output flanges and jet input flanges will be aligned parallel to within 0.003" as measured at diametrically<br />opposed edges of the flanges, and flange longitudinal centerline offset will be held to within the<br />tolerance of the drive shaft U&#8208;joints. See notes from Precision Maintenance Inc. alignment performed<br />9/21/11. Alignment notes are included in the SOW, pages 4 and 5. Additionally, and if required,<br />reposition the engine&#8208;driven hydraulic pump and any other engine&#8208;driven equipment to maintain<br />alignments. Upon launch of the vessel, measure alignment and adjust while water&#8208;borne to tolerances<br />stated above. After all alignment work is complete, trial the vessel at all speeds to prove accurate<br />alignment and full function of machinery.<br />7] Install GFM inverter/charger<br />Remove the existing inverter/charger in the vessel and replace it with the unit supplied by the<br />government. Provide all other parts required to complete the installation. Where required, upgrade<br />breakers, cables, and wires associated with the inverter/charger to meet all applicable standards of<br />ABYC and USCG. Upon completion, test the unit to prove full function in both inverter and charger<br />modes.<br />8] Install bilge alarms<br />Install an additional float switch in the forward void, the tank room, and the engine room, these to<br />function as a high bilge water alarm sensors. Position these switches 4" above the existing bilge pump<br />actuation switches and in a secure location in the aft sections of each compartment. Install a small<br />indicator panel (or three separate panels) in the console and wire these to the alarm new sensors.<br />Panels will provide audible and visual indication that the sensors have been tripped, and a mute button<br />for the audible function only. The panels will be positioned and labeled to denote location in the hull.<br />Power for the sensors and panels may be taken off the bilge pump circuits or a new circuit if space is<br />available. Upon completion test each sensor and panel to prove complete functionality.<br />*End of Scope of Work*<br />Laser Alignments &bull; In-field Balancing &bull; Vibration Diagnostics<br />Visit us at www pminw.com<br />COMPANY: N.O.A.A SHIP/PLANT: Tatoosh R/V DATE: 09/21/2011<br />MACHINE Port M/E to R/G SPEED: 2200 Rpm TECHNICIAN: Troy Stocks<br />UNITS: ENGLISH / METRIC<br />FOOT POSITION<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />OFFSET ANGULARITY ALIGNMENT AT THE COUPLING (@ 10")<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />ANGULARITY OFFSET ANGULARITY OFFSET<br />Initial Cold -30 235 -75 36<br />Final Cold -5 110 -20 49<br />Initial Hot<br />Final Hot<br />TARGETS / TOLERANCES<br />+/-5 100+/-3 +/-5 +/-3<br />NOTES: Alignment was corrected to the angle of 1.5 vertical.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC><strong>Addendum to Sources Sought Synopsis<br /></strong>For Procurement of GBU-31, GBU-32, GBU-54 Weapon System and Related Technical Services
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes an Addendum to the Sources Sought Synopsis FA8213-11-R-3026 for the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) production lots 18 through 23. The purpose of this Addendum is to supplement the original synopsis by adding the requirement for technical services related to JDAM production.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This synopsis addendum is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Katie Barker/OO-ALC/GHGKA, (801) 777-8403. Formal information submitted should be addressed to OO-ALC/GHGKA (JDAM), Attn: Ms. Katie Barker, 6033 Elm Lane Bldg 1247, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825.</p>
<p>The United States Air Force is planning an acquisition strategy for the follow-on production of the JDAM system to include the technical services support necessary to successfully manage production. The technical support contract for JDAM provides the engineering, management, and logistic support required to ensure the continued Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) of the weapon system IAW AFPD 63-12. It is anticipated the technical support scope will include (at a minimum) the following tasks: simulations/modeling, lot acceptance test and Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) technical support, system field support, aircraft integration technical support, non-warranty repair actions, software maintenance/upgrades, assessments of impacts such as changes in GPS infrastructure, and studies and analyses related to current and future expansion of JDAM system performance. <br /><br />Contract award for the JDAM production and technical services support is estimated to be approximately January 2014. Potential offerors would be required to provide JDAM assets as well as the technical support services described herein. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, is the original equipment manufacturer of the JDAM system and has design control, authorization, and ownership of the data rights for the JDAM system.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman is Mr. Kevin Flinders/PKC, (801) 777-4392.</p>
<p>Again, this synopsis addendum is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis.</p>

<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>060412
<CONTACT>Gayle Little, Contracting Officer, Phone 4057346995, Fax 4057363125, Email gayle.little@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>T56-15 Request for Information
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, which, as part of market research, is being issued in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation/request for proposal and no contract shall be resultant from this synopsis. The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center's T56 Program Office Branch (OC-ALC/GKGDC) is seeking to identify potential vendors input to realistic T56 Subcontracting Goals and input for potential price band quantity ranges in regards to the T56 workload as part of follow-on analysis questions to previously posted RFIs. T56 workload processes include manufacture/repair /overhaul and supply chain management support for Whole Engines, Power Sections, and Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) components beginning early Calendar Year 2014. For purposes of this RFI, a SB is defined by the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 336412 with a size standard of total company employees not to exceed 1,000 employees. The Product Service Code (PSC) for this workload is J028.</p>
<p>Description of services - Engine Overhaul/Repair consisting of the labor and material necessary to accomplish the Overhaul/Repair of the C-130 power packages, T56 Engine, modules, components, accessories, and piece parts. Engine scheduled and unscheduled depot maintenance will be performed in accordance with applicable T56 and C-130 Quick Engine Change Kit Technical Order (T.O.) requirements. This requirement also entails Receiving, Handling, Transporting, Inspecting, Testing, Repairing, Overhauling, Performance Testing, Functional Testing, Pre/Post Bore-scope Inspections, and Engine Preservation. The Overhaul/Repair process includes the management and procurement of consumable material. In addition to overhaul production, associated engineering/technical support requirements of maintenance function such as Part Deficiency Investigation, Engine Teardown Deficiency, Analytical Condition Inspection, Engine Mishap Investigation Support, Dimensional/Material Lab Analysis and Maintenance Data Systems Management are within the scope of this requirement. The maintenance program for the T56 engine is based on the principles of On Condition Maintenance (OCM). All maintenance is based on the actual condition of the item as determined by inspection, testing, occurrence of a specific event, or expiration of operating time limits. Under the OCM concept, most removals are unscheduled. However, these unscheduled removals are often the result of scheduled -6 inspections. The life and maintenance management plans for the engine have established Turbine Rotor Assembly Maximum Operating Time limits as well as Low Cycle Fatigue life limits for fracture critical components. The T56 program also utilizes the Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) concept to maximize the life cycle cost of the engine. As such, RCM principles are employed in the overhaul/repair build standards and data management for RCM is maintained by the maintenance source.</p>
<p>As stated above, the T56 repair requirement consists of whole engine builds as well as component repair (i.e., turbine module) to support field activities. For planning purposes, the forecasted T56 engine workload is approximately 165 engines per year and MISTR component repairs average around 10,000 items per year. A listing of anticipated engine and component items is provided with this RFI to obtain vendor responses regarding the following RFI questions as outlined in later paragraphs below.</p>
<p>All responsible sources interested in providing services for this requirement are requested to provide a written summary of information concerning their technical certifications, capabilities, experience (current services or contracts - to include points of contact and telephone numbers) and corporate background. Interested parties should provide a description of potential approaches for review by the Government no later than 9:00 a.m. CST, 20 days from RFI issuance. NO telephone calls will be accepted. Interested sources should also indicate if your company is listed as Large Business company, or designated as a Small Business and if so, indicate what Small Business category your company falls under (Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Small Business, and Hubzone Small Business). This acquisition will fall under NAICS 336412 and its applicable size standard of 1,000 employees. The PSC code for these requirements is J028. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages or less and a typographical font of 12 or greater. All responses and questions should be forwarded to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Gayle Little, OC-ALC/GKGK, Tinker AFB, OK 73145 gayle.little@tinker.af.mil.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids, nor does its issuance restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to understand from the vendor's perspective what realistic Small Business (SB) subcontracting goals are in relation to the T56 workload. It is the Government's intent to make SB Subcontracting goals and participation plans to achieve goals as part of any potential proposal evaluation. Additionally, the Government is seeking to understand the market-based input to price bands for given Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs) workload ranges and what, if any, the vendor sees as a logical workload BEQ range and break point for the T56 workload categories listed below in RFI questions.</p>
<p>1. Given the below table reflecting the current Department of Defense (DoD) Small Business FY13 Subcontracting Goals, what percentage of T56 workload does your company subcontract to SB today and what does your company believe are realistic, achievable percent goals for SB subcontracting categories?<br />DoD Small Business Subcontracting Category FY13 Percent Goal<br />Small Business 36.7%<br />HUBZone Small Business 3.0%<br />Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.0%<br />Small Disadvantaged Business 5.0%<br />Women-Owned Small Business, Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities and Minority Institutions 5.0%</p>
<p><br /><br />2. For the Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) posted to FedBizOpps on 1 Feb 2012, what does your company believe would be the logical price band quantity ranges for only the Whole Engine, Power Section, Reduction Gearbox, Compressor Module, Turbine Module, Turbine Rotor, and Torquemeter workload items? (BEQ's posted against Solicitation # FA810013R0001, file titled "Estimated BEQ for RFI Responses")</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0004 is to address questions and to remove wording from Ordering Clause in Section I on the RFP.
QUESTION 1)  Is pricing simply "not to exceed pricing" and contractors will need to bid every time there is a deliver qty, even the first qty?  
GOV'T RESPONSE:  See L.3.4 on what to submit for pricing and M.3.4 on how price will be evaluated.  There is a weighted evaluated price template in Section J that gives offerors a "sample" of how the Government will evaluate price.  
Please see the ORDERING PERIOD Clause on Page 36 which provides guidance on future bids.  The clause states:  Please note that the ceiling prices proposed by offerors in Section B will be valid for any delivery orders issued (awarded) at the time of ID/IQ contract award.  However, these ceiling prices are subject to downward adjustment only for the pricing of future delivery orders.

QUESTION 2)  Will the Government award the first qty from the pricing we submit?
GOV'T RESPONSE:  No delivery order will be issued at the time of ID/IQ contract award.  Contractors will submit their FAAT price and pricing for each of the ranges in Section B - for each of the 5 ordering periods. These prices will be binding during the five year ordering period but are subject to downward adjustment.  

QUESTION 3)  Will the Government use the pricing we submit to award every delivery qty every year?
GOV'T RESPONSE:  The pricing the successful contractor uses in ordering period (year) one will be used for all ordering period (year) one actions, the ordering period pricing the successful contractor uses in ordering period (year) 2 will be used for all ordering period (year) 2 actions, etc.  The prices are subject to downward adjustment only.  
Please complete pricing in Section B:

<DESC>Due to the urgent need to field Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Applique systems for Capability Set 13 (CS13), the Army will look at the option to procure hardware through the General Services Administration (GSA) for the third brigade slated for fielding in April 2013.  The first two CS13 brigades will receive additional AN/PRC-117Gs in October 2012 to meet their vehicular SRW requirements.  The GSA option is intended as a "contingency bridge" to ensure sufficient SRW Applique hardware is available to field to the third CS13 Brigade in April 2013.  The Army will continue with its Request for Proposals for an SRW Applique Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to support future procurements.  In October 2012 the Army will revisit the progress of the IDIQ contract and determine if we should procure the SRW Applique for the third CS13 Brigade off of a GSA schedule or the IDIQ.  SRW radios must be registered/available on the GSA Schedule to be considered for this potential GSA award.  Companies requiring assistance getting onto the GSA Schedule should contact Ms. Van Tran, Branch Chief, Customer & Administrative Support Branch IT Market Development, phone 703-605-2711, email van.tran@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The response date to this RFI is hereby updated to 8 June 2012. All other conditions remain unchanged. <br>						<br>Proactive Situational Awareness (SA)<br>Request for Information (RFI)<br>May 2012<br><br>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.<br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br><br>OBJECTIVE:  The Army is interested in enhancing the situational awareness and understanding of lower echelon leaders (Company, Platoon, and Squad).  Currently small units are constrained by limited or no staff-level Intel Analyst expertise, limited access to a common operating picture (COP), and limited time to gather and analyze pertinent Intelligence information.  Critical tactical intelligence data may not reach small units in a timely fashion resulting in surprise attacks.  <br><br>The objective of this effort will be to leverage existing and currently emerging technologies and integrate within the Army Intel cloud architecture to provide situational awareness and actionable intelligence at the edge.  To accomplish this, the Army is interested in extending the current Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) cloud capabilities by creating a company micro cloud to provide mobile Intel information and analysis capabilities at the lower levels and allow for the integration between Intel and Operations applications and data.  Also, the Army is looking to expand current DCGS-A cloud capabilities to provide Intel based threat inference for the squad, real-time tips and cues, and advanced sensing to support the squad.  This analytic result will be used to improve the Company Intelligence Support Team (COIST) decision making process by using collaborative and intuitive visualization thin client widgets that are developed specifically to conform to the DCGS-A Ozone platform.  This effort will also provide two way communications between Intel and Mission Command systems so that Intel and operations data can be seamlessly displayed.  This effort will tightly integrate with solutions from Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Command, Power, and Integration Directorate (CPI) which is tasked with providing the Soldiers with innovative visualizations and decision support services that will depend significantly on information from Mission Command, the new Intel information, and will integrate with the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P).<br><br>DESCRIPTION: <br>To reach the overarching Army goal to extend situational awareness and understanding to the lower echelons, the Intelligence and Information Warfare (I2WD) is interested in a range of technologies and novel approaches. At the top level there will be innovation in the following areas: extensions of predicative analysis tools and models, tighter integration of sensor data with current architecture, real-time tips and cues with cross domain solutions to provide Intel information to the lowest level, intuitive thin client Intel based widgets, and a micro cloud to extend the processing capabilities at the lowest level.  <br><br>The Proactive Situational Awareness (SA) Demonstration Project is aimed at providing an integrated solution with the addition of the following capabilities listed below. All proposed technologies need to be capable of integrating into a Program Of Record (POR) and conform to the POR architecture such as, but not limited, to the DCGS-A Cloud. I2WD is specifically seeking industry input for one or more of the following capability areas. Responses to any of the following topics will be considered.<br><br>1. Proactive Analysis and Alerting Tools - Technologies to provide near real-time reiterative threat projection and automated Intel based alerts (include but not limited to): analytics, models, multi model analytics, model frameworks, data mining, and all-source fusion techniques to proactively provide real time situation awareness and understanding. Also, technologies that provide a way to disseminate these automated tips and cues from the analytic and Intel sensor data to small units. Dissemination technologies should consider the potential need for Cross Domain Information Exchange (CDIE) solutions.<br>2. Micro Cloud - Provide high performance computing environment that supports operations and intelligence collaboration, shared intelligence services, data, and information collaboration across echelons and platforms in real time at the company level.  Areas of interest are architecture, processing power, reduced size, weight, and power (SWAP), and novel ways to sync data to and from higher echelon.<br>3. Sensor Data Integration - Provide common sensor interface, data correlation, data feed into Squad Tips & Cues framework, and integration into the DCGS-A Cloud.<br><br>Proactive SA will be working with and transitioning results to partners from:<br>* Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS)<br>* Program Executive Office Command Control Communications - Tactical (PEO C3T)<br>* Program Executive Office Aviation (PEO Aviation) <br><br>Response:<br>We are asking industry to provide a response to this RFI that includes the following tasks:<br>1. Clearly define technical approach and the capabilities addressed.<br>2. A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for each capability per year, not to exceed 3 years, to include potential integration efforts necessary for the technology to transition.<br>3. Clearly state the software licensing rights of the proposed technology.<br>4. State how this effort can transition into a POR and what level of effort is needed to transition this effort.<br><br>Responses to this RFI are to be unclassified and received no later than 8 June 2012. All interested parties shall respond in as clear a manner as possible to each of the areas listed above. Information is preferred in soft-copy Microsoft Word format and shall not exceed 20 (twenty) pages. If soft-copy cannot be provided, written information will be accepted no later than 8 June 2012. You may forward your responses via email to: proactiverfi@mi.army.mil; Subject Line: Proactive Situational Awareness RFI. All information must be in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward written responses to US Army CERDEC, I2WD, 6003 Combat Dr., APG MD, 21005, ATTN: RDER-IWP-KE (Ms. Danielle Duff). <br><br>The Army may require non-government technical experts to assist in the evaluation of white papers and proposals submitted in response to this topic.  Such non-government personnel will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  An Offeror's submittal of a white paper and/or proposal shall constitute acknowledgement and acceptance of the Government's use of non-government experts for this acquisition.<br>Distribution A - Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.<br><br><br><br>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional information.  


1)  How many portable units will be purchased for U.S. Navy ships? 
Answer: No set number can be placed for this as our ordering capabilities will depend on funding, ship availabilities, life expectancies, and other factors.  

2)  Can we get mounting dimensions for Siemens Military Multix Pro? 
Answer: Mounting dimensions should now be available via the Drawings document we are adding to the RFI. 

3)  The High-capability portable has transport restriction of 68" H while  low-capability portable has restriction of 75" H and the Low-capability system only has a 75"H restriction. The 68" H transport restriction seems to be restrictive, GE is requesting a 75" H restriction for both systems.
 
Answer: Due to the low hang of certain ceiling structures onboard Navy Ships (i.e. Surgical Lights in OR), the ceiling height for the High-Cap unit was set at 68 to reduce the probability that the unit will come into contact with any low-hanging obstructions. As for the Low-Cap units, since they are almost always set in a tilted-back position during transit, they are allotted a larger maximum height for transport mode. 

4) Is 700 lbs. weight hard limit for high capability portable?  Is 100 lbs. hard limit for low capability portable? 
Answer: No; this is a target limit, units that exceed this weight will not be excluded from this review. 

5) Does tether for the detector have to be permanent (cannot remove tether from detector)? 
Answer:  Tethered is the more optimal configuration, although if there is a significant cost difference in tethered vs hardwired, and the hardwired configuration could enable detectors to be swapped out in the event of failure in a short amount of time, then the hardwired configuration would be acceptable/preferred.
 

6) What is meant by "automatic or internal line voltage compensation"? 
Answer: Due to the fluctuation of the ships voltage, the power that will be fed to the x-ray unit will vary, as such, the calibration of the kVp output of the units has been known to vary in certain units depending upon the exact incoming voltage that is powering the unit, which requires that any x-ray unit to be installed onboard a Navy Ship have a automatic or internal line voltage compensation to accommodate for these fluctuations by the supplied power.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following responses to vendor questions:<br /><br />Amendment No. 0002
<p>The following responses are provided to vendor questions received:</p>
<p>1) Question: In addition to the products outlined on page 2 of the solicitation (dissolvable tobacco products, cigarillos, e-cigarettes), what additional products will be characterized during the duration of this IDIQ?</p>
<p>Government Response: The current IDIQ focuses on the identified products. Currently, products of interest are limited to orally dissolvable or inhaled products If another product is identified as of interest, FDA would work with the Contractor to ensure a good fit for that particular task order and the IDIQ contract would be appropriately modified.</p>
<p>2) Question: What are the primary technologies of the modified risk tobacco products (i.e., buccal spray, nasal spray, sublingual, heated tobacco, chewing gum, vaporizers, etc.) that will be studied under this IDIQ?</p>
<p>Government Response: The products identified under the current solicitation include a multiple of routes of exposure, including buccal and inhalation.</p>
<p>3) Question: Do you anticipate the utilization of a comparator (i.e., a cigarette or other nicotine replacement) in some or all of these studies?</p>
<p>Government Response: Yes.</p>
<p>4) Question: Can you share with us your vision for the full set of PD assessments?</p>
<p>Government Response: As stated in the RFP, it is anticipated that all assessments will typically include measurement of tobacco-related compounds in saliva, blood and/or plasma. What is measured, and using what matrix, will depend on the product being tested which cannot be fully identified at this time.</p>
<p>5) Question: Is there a comprehensive list of exactly what compounds and metabolites need to be assayed and in what specific matrix (urine, saliva, plasma) they are to be analyzed?</p>
<p>Government Response No. As with the specific matrix, details will depend on the product being tested. FDA will work with the Contractor and provide additional information in specific task orders.</p>
<p>6) Are there documents specifying the methodology to be used for each assay with required LLOQ's, concentration ranges, etc.?</p>
<p>FDA will work with the Contractor on methodologies as appropriate for individual task orders.</p>
<p>7) Question: Under which regulatory requirements do these assays need to be performed (CLIA, GMP, GLP)?</p>
<p>Government Response: CLIA</p>

<DESC><strong>Amendment 0004<br /><br /></strong>The reason for this amendment is to allow for scheduled site visits and to allow for additional requests for samples.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Contractors who are interested in scheduling a site visit may do so by contacting USEPA Remedial Project Manager Tim Gallagher at 215-814-3196.&nbsp; All site visits must be completed by close of business on June 29, 2012.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; The Government will provide up to three (3) five gallon bucket samples upon request.&nbsp; Contractors who&nbsp;are interested in obtaining samples may do so by submitting&nbsp;requests via email to Ryan Parker at parker.ryan@epa.gov. Requests must be made by 4:00 pm EDT on June 29, 2012. The request must include a valid shipping address and the name of the person responsible for accepting the samples, as well as the number of samples requested. If the request does not include the required information, the government will not provide the samples. The organization making the request is solely responsible for providing accurate shipping information. If samples are returned as undeliverable, the government will not attempt subsequent delivery, nor will it provide notice to the requester. Each bucket will contain material from a sample point on each of the four "sides" of the pile. The buckets will be shipped, via UPS or equivalent, to the person and address given in the request. Because of the size and nature of the pile, the Government cannot guarantee that the contents of each bucket will be identical, or that the contents of any bucket will reflect the exact composition/measurement of the metals that may be found throughout the site. The Government does not want, nor will it accept, any returned samples. It is the requesters' responsibility to dispose of their samples in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.<br /><br />All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is a Modification to RFI #G12PS00352 and is issued to ANSWER QUESTIONS RECEIVED as follows:
1.  Does the Government intend to award a contract for both algal and benthic taxonomy or will the government award separate contracts?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation.  This a Request for Information only.
2.  Can the respondent submit for only the algal or only the macroinvertebrate work separately without a response for the other portion?  ANSWER:  Yes, the respondent may submit for one or the other or both, whatever they specialize in.
3.  Is this a new contract, or a new bid of existing work?  If the latter, is there an incumbent and if so can you provide the name of the group that held the prior contract?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information only.
4.  Approximately how many of each type of samples is the government contracting?  Do you anticipate that the work will be sent in a single task order, or multiple task orders?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information only.
5.  If a lab does not respond to this initial solicitation, does this preclude that lab from responding to any service procurement solicitations that result from this initial solicitation?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation, this is a Request for Information (RFI) and nonresponse  will not preclude a lab from responding to any solicitation that results from the RFI.
6.  Who is the incumbent?  What is the budget for this project? What is the estimated range of proposed samples? With regards to the page limit (15) pages, is there a minimum size font? Will a coverage and/or organizational chart count towards page limit?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information Only.  The page limit is inclusive of all documents.  A size font has not been established so it is up to each respondent to determine size font.
7.  Is it possible to increase the small business standard size to allow us to participate?  ANSWER:  This is not a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information only and anyone who feels they are able to provide information are encouraged to do so.
END OF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RECEIVED.
Taxonomic Analysis of Algae and Benthic Invertebrate Samples
Request for Information (RFI)
This is not an announcement of a Solicitation. 
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide taxonomic analysis of freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples.  The overarching objective of this RFI is information gathering and not acquisition of products or services. 
PURPOSE, SCOPE & INFORMATION SOUGHT:  Part of the mission of the USGS is to provide an understanding of water-quality conditions; whether conditions are getting better or worse over time; and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. Regional and national assessments are possible because of a consistent study design and uniform methods of data collection and analysis. Biological, chemical, and physical monitoring data are integrated with geographic information on hydrological characteristics, land use, and other landscape features in models to extend water-quality understanding to unmonitored areas. Local, State, Tribal, and national stakeholders use water quality information to design and implement strategies for managing, protecting, and monitoring water resources in many different hydrologic and land-use settings across the Nation.
This is a general request for information to determine industry's capability to perform laboratory analysis of freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples. Laboratory analysis includes washing/sieving samples, subsampling and sorting organisms, preparing slides, identifying and enumerating organisms, and related quality assurance/quality control. Responses should address the following:
1.	Ability to process freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples including related quality assurance/quality control procedures, according to standard, widely accepted, and documented protocols. Examples of USGS approved protocols are listed below. Laboratories using protocols other than approved USGS protocols should describe in sufficient detail (or provide a URL link to such information) the procedures they use. 
a.	Charles, D.F., Knowles, C., and Davis, R.S. (eds.). 2002. Protocols for the analysis of algal samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Academy of Natural Sciences Report No. 02-06, 124 p. [available at: http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/protocols/algprotocol/index.html]
b.	Moulton II, S.R., Carter, J.L., Grotheer, S.A., Cuffney, T.F., and Short, T.M. 2000. Methods of analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory-- Processing, taxonomy, and quality control of benthic macroinvertebrate samples. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 00-212, 49 p. [available at: http://nwql.usgs.gov/Public/pubs/OFR00-212.pdf]
2.	Ability to participate in external quality control testing of sample analysis. Examples of such testing might include, but are not limited to: (1) processing split samples by independent laboratories to assess comparability of taxonomic identifications and enumerations; or (2) submit synoptic reference collections that are reviewed by independent analysts to evaluate the accuracy of taxonomic identifications.
3.	Information about the educational level/major, professional experience and certifications of staff involved in processing samples described in No. 1 above.
4.	Ability to complete sample analysis within six (6) months of receiving a sample and comply with requirements to interact with the USGS BioData Data Management System [https://aquatic.biodata.usgs.gov]. The BioData system stores, maintains, and distributes algae and invertebrate identification and enumeration data. Laboratories must interact with this system to (1) obtain lab orders placed by USGS personnel, and (2) to upload taxonomic identification and enumeration results produced by the laboratory. Prior to interacting with the system a laboratory must:
-	Designate one or more data managers who will retrieve laboratory orders, upload data, and serve as the principle points of contact for USGS system administrators and data managers. The laboratory data managers will be given access to the BioData system contingent on USGS approval.-	Complete BioData laboratory-user training provided by USGS.-	Demonstrate that laboratory data managers understand the lab order and laboratory results upload file format, content, and validation requirements.-	Successfully complete a test upload of taxonomic identification and enumeration laboratory results.Laboratories download orders prior to processing samples shipped to them by USGS personnel. Each order represents one sample that must be processed and reported as a unit. The laboratory order download is a zip file containing three tab-delimited tables that list (1) laboratory orders, (2) containers associated with each order, and (3) the sites where samples were collected. Laboratories can use the information to support sample processing. The LabOrderID provided by BioData must be used when data are delivered to associate laboratory results with the applicable BioData lab order. Descriptions of three tables are available at https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/biodata/BioData+Lab+Handbook.
Analytical results must be delivered to the BioData system by uploading a data file. Laboratory data managers will be provided access to perform that task. The file must meet all of the data format, content, and validation rules specified by USGS.  Detailed information about these requirements is available at https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/biodata/BioData+Lab+Handbook.
RESPONSE DUE DATE:  Interested vendors who believe they can process freshwater benthic algae and invertebrate samples based on the requirements and characteristics listed above, are invited to submit their capabilities in a response of no more than 15 pages either electronically or one (1) hard copy to the following address by 2:00pm, EDT, May 22, 2012:		US Geological Survey	12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, MS205, Room 6A338Reston, VA  20192Attn:  Lynda McCarthy, Contracting Officer
Email:  Lmccarthy@usgs.gov
Responses received after this date will not be evaluated. Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted via email to Lynda McCarthy, Contracting Officer, at Lmccarthy@usgs.gov by no later than 2:00pm, EDT, May 14, 2012.  Please include with your questions your full name, reference the RFI number and title, "Taxonomic Analysis of Algae and Benthic Invertebrate Samples."  Questions will not be accepted after submission of capability statements.
Responses should include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email address, business type, and approximate base cost information per sample. Past performance information should be submitted for applicable references with projects conducted similar in scope and complexity within the last three (3) years. Complete contact information (name, phone, email, website URL), description of project, contract number, contract value and period of performance should be provided for each reference.
DISCLAIMER:  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 15.201(e), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/USGS intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Responses will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of review.Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. To notify the Government of sensitive information, data identified as Proprietary contained in a response to this RFI, offerors shall mark the cover page of the response and each affected page of the response with indications that it contains proprietary information. The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a response if it is not marked proprietary (reference FAR 52.215-1(e) for procedures on marking sensitive information.  The words "proposals" contained in FAR 52.215-1(e) shall not be construed to mean proposals in the sense of responding to a solicitation since, in this case, this is an RFI).

J&A DULY SIGNED BY ALL CONCERNED PARTIES.


DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Purchase Request No. is 672-12-3-516-0018. This procurement is for the Facility and Management Service, Roads and Parking Maintenance Services.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This procurement is intended to provide all labor, equipment and supervision to render complete parking lot maintenance as indicated, and other related services at the VACHS, 10 Casia Street, San Juan, Puerto Rico, as required. The contract type is the firm-fixed price. This is not a follow-on contract.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The services to be rendered are mainly preventive maintenance and painting, as required, of the parking lot spaces; excluding AMA Parking areas, which are part of the lessor responsibilities. This short-term contract will be awarded as a sole source to the incumbent as authorized by the following statement: 8(a) Businesses Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes SBA to contract for goods and services with federal agencies. SBA then subcontracts actual performance of the work to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, which have been certified by SBA as eligible to receive these contracts. The major advantage of this program is that it allows the government to contract, on a noncompetitive basis, with socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. SBA also offers managerial, technical, and financial support to participating firms not to exceed $3 million per contract.
Department of Transportation (DOT) gives special emphasis to identifying procurement requirements for matching with the capabilities and potential of approved 8(a) firms. DOT has obtained special authority from the SBA to negotiate directly with 8(a) firms on the behalf of SBA.
Program participation is divided into two stages. The developmental stage is designed to help 8(a) certified firms overcome their economic disadvantage by providing personalized business assistance in expanding their business and fostering meaningful business relationships. This period covers years one through four of a firm's participation. The transitional stage is designed to help program participants become more effective in both the large business and government sector market in dealing with complex business deals and to prepare them for post 8(a) program expansion and development. Formal certification is required by the SBA. This period occurs from the fifth through the ninth year of the firm's participation in the program. Businesses must meet eligibility requirements established by the SBA each year including pre-established 8(a) vs. non-8(a) revenue mixes.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: As per FAR 6.302-5 the above mentioned statement written on Item #3 authorizes to continue with the firm certified on the 8(a) Program; as the one that have been providing these services for the past five (5) years, Casablanka Contractors, Inc. Mr. Sandy Gerber, SBA at (973) 645-3729 clarified that the agency doesn't have to compete if the Contractor is performing as an acceptable level, and is financially responsible to continue providing services on the 8(a) Program.
( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( X ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the  Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): As per Mr. Sandy Gerber from SBA at (973) 645-3729 the company that is 8(a) certified can continue providing services under the designated program; if the firm has shown an acceptable level of performance and financially capable of doing it. It is not required to compete (Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes SBA to contract for goods and services with federal agencies. SBA then subcontracts actual performance of the work to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, which have been certified by SBA as eligible to receive these contracts. The major advantage of this program is that it allows the government to contract, on a noncompetitive basis, with socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. SBA also offers managerial, technical, and financial support to participating firms not to exceed $3 million per contract.) Even though that explanation, the long-term procurement will be competed as a Cascading LPTA: it will include SDVOSB, VOSB, and Small Businesses with the required NAICS code to perform these duties. The company that receives the award shall demonstrate to be technically acceptable, as well as a proposing a fair and reasonable price to the Government; taking into consideration the historical data available.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Five (5) records were found in the CCR as SDVOSB's and eleven (11) records found as VOSB under NAICS Code 561790 for the Puerto Rico area. This data will be used and updated subsequently for the long-term procurement. For purposes of this short-term contract this data will not be taken into consideration. It will emphasize the FAR authority to continue services with a well-known 8(a) company that is performing currently for the past five (5) years with no complaints. If they are interested to continue bringing these services after September 30, 2012, they will have to compete it although they can continue, as per 8(a) Program Authority up to nine years for full development.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: Contractor will be required to submit a proposal based on the most recent changes in parking area available to be served. The area to be served had been considerable reduced; in addition, several parking areas were included in the lessor's responsibilities (AMA Parking Areas). No certified cost or pricing data will be required since this is a commercial item, however, historical data will be taken into consideration for evaluation of fair and reasonable pricing
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Research conducted on Vetbiz for 561790 NAICS code showed only two businesses: GIRE Developments Corp which was found in DOL violations, and Project Management Solutions which is the owner of PRESCO. This last, although not determined as conducting fraud by the OIG investigator, doubts about his technical capability to perform are present. His main business is construction, and not this type of industry. He is performing the Deodorizing Services contract for which he has requested equitable adjustment despite it was awarded as a firm-fixed price, and the Government has serious concerns about the deodorizer used for more than a year because Contractor couldn't provide evidence of its purchase.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The long-term contract for these services is in process, and will be open for competition using the Cascading method: SDVOSB' s, VOSB's and Small Businesses. It will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: See Section VI above.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before  Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: The long-term procurement is under peer review at this moment, and will continue the PALT accordingly. It is expected to be completed and ready for award by October 1, 2012; competing using Cascading method: SDVOSB, VOSB, and Small Businesses that demonstrate to be competent in this industry; the selection and award is planned to be for the lowest price technically acceptable.
12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
